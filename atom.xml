<p><em>Dr Piotr Wozniak, 1999年2月</em></p>
<p>当您正尝试提高学习效率（加速学习）时，本文将用于帮助您克服学习中所面对的最大困难之一：组织知识</p>
<p>学习速度取决于你组织学习材料的方式。如果组织的很好，那么对于相同的材料，就能在更短的时间内进行更有效的学习，其效率（速度）上的差别是令人震惊的。</p>
<p>这些原则以其重要性来排序，那些列在最前面的，往往是经常被违犯的，但一旦能够很好的遵循它们，将带来很大的收益。</p>
<p>这里还有一项潜在的假设就是你会用“间隔重复”的方法来进行学习。比如，你不是仅仅学习一次，而是会用一种优化的方式反复的温习你的学习材料。</p>
<p>在学习过程中组织知识的20条原则</p>
<h2 id="原则一不理解不要学">原则一：不理解，不要学</h2>
<p>试图去学习一些你自己不理解的材料是完全无意义的。尽管如此，依然有惊人比例的学生去犯这种不理解材料就盲目学习的错误。很多时候他们没有选择，教科书和讲义的质量相当糟糕却又不得不面对临近的考试。</p>
<p>即使你不讲德语，你仍然可以学习用德语写的历史教材。你可以逐字逐句的硬记他，但是这样盲目学习的时间是巨大的。而更为严重的是，这种所谓知识的价值简直微不足道。因为你只是死记硬背了德语教材，但你对历史仍然一无所知。</p>
<p>德语教材只是一个极端的例子。你的学习材料往往看起来组织有序，而你可能因为对这些材料缺乏理解而责备自己。很快，你的学习过程中就会充斥着大量无用的材料，并危险的让你相信：将来总有一天会有用吧？</p>
<h2 id="原则二先学习再记忆">原则二：先学习，再记忆</h2>
<p>在开始学习各自单列的资料时，你应该就所学的知识建立一个全面的印象。只有把各自独立的知识串成一个整体结构，才能大幅度降低你的学习时间。这就象在“规则一：如果不理解，就不要学”中所提到的一样。独立的知识点就像是德语历史教材中的单个词语。</p>
<p>不要从松散的资料开始记忆！首先阅读书中能把这些知识整合起来的章节（如：内燃机原理）。然后才使用独立的问答来进行学习。（如：什么驱动了活塞在内燃机内的运动？）</p>
<h2 id="原则三构建于基础">原则三：构建于基础</h2>
<p>对于学习材料的整体印象并不需要完善到细枝末节处。恰恰相反，该印象越简单越好，书籍的起始章节也是越短越好。越是简单的知识模型越是容易被理解和涵盖。日后你可以在此基础上进一步的构建。</p>
<p>不要忽视基础。记忆看似浅显的知识并不是在浪费时间。基础知识可能也会突然改变而记忆简单事情所花费的时间又不多，所以还是保险点好。记住，通常你会花费50%的时间来复习3%-5%学习过的材料[<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/articles/theory.htm">来源</a>]! 基础知识却只要花很少的时间就能记住。然而，对基础知识的任一疏忽往往代价沉重。</p>
<h2 id="原则四遵循最小信息原则">原则四：遵循最小信息原则</h2>
<p>你的学习材料须尽可能以简单的方式进行组织。</p>
<p>1、简单即容易</p>
<p>根据定义，简单的材料容易记忆。这来自一个事实即简单化让大脑更容易以同样的方式进行处理。想象一下迷宫。当对一个材料进行复习时，你的大脑就像在通过一个迷宫（你可以把神经网络看成错综的路径）。通过迷宫时，大脑会在迷宫墙上留下了线索。如果他能以唯一方式通过，那么此路径就简单而便于跟随。反之，如果有很多组合的话，每一次通过就会留下不同的线索彼此干扰，从而难以找到出口。这同样发生在大脑细胞层面，每次复习复杂材料时，不同的大脑突触连接会被激活。</p>
<p>2、简单易安排</p>
<p>我们假设你将使用最优重复间隔法来复习学过的材料（如SuperMemo）。如果你思虑的一个学习项是由两个子项构成的，那么你将需要足够频繁的复习才能把较难的子项记住。若把复杂项拆分成各个子项，各项的复习就能以各自的节奏进行从而节省了时间。一个缺乏经验的学生所创建的学习项，往往可以被轻易的划分成十个或更多的子项！虽然，学习项的数量增多了，但各项复习时间却往往很少，以致其益处远超于1)一遍遍忘记复杂内容2)过短的复习间隔3)实际只记住了部分内容 所付出的代价。</p>
<p>下面是一个明显的例子：</p>

<p>你可能想试验下并尝试用上述两种方法来学习两个主题，然后看看最小信息原则所能带来的好处。从长远来讲好处尤其明显，例如，你记忆知识所需时间越多，你从简化材料所获收益也就越多。</p>
<p>注意，上述例子中的问题很简短，答案就更为简短了！我们要求单次复习中从记忆中汲取的信息量足够小，回答就要尽可能的短！</p>
<p>你可能注意到了，组织很差和良好的知识点并不完全等同。比如：尽管你记住了死海为什么能使游泳者漂浮，而起初你可能完全忘记了它还有这个特点。还有，数字396到400以及74到70的四舍五入为造成一些信息丢失。这些问题都可以解决，如增加更多问题，或者使呈现的问题更为精确。</p>
<p>为此，当老师把你叫到黑板前，你可能没办法流利背诵完整的死海描述。然而我敢说，你学习的的最终目的，并不是为了在班级里显得熠熠生辉。若想了解如何处理朗诵和诗词，可以进一步阅读(有关枚举的<a href="CN.md">专属章节</a>)</p>
<h2 id="原则五填空题简单而有效">原则五：填空题简单而有效</h2>
<p>填空题是以省略号替换了部分缺失内容的句子。填空练习就是运用填空题要求学生将缺失的部分填写完整的练习形式。比如：比尔...[名字]是美国第二位被弹劾的总统。</p>
<p>作为初学者，如果你发现很难遵循最小信息原则，请用填空题。如果你是高阶用户，你同样会喜欢填空题。填空题是将教科书内容转化为知识点的快捷有效方法，并适合以间隔重复的方法来学习。填空题构成了一种称之为“增量阅读”的快速阅读和学习技巧的核心。</p>

<h2 id="原则六使用图片">原则六：使用图片</h2>
<p>视觉皮层是大脑中用来处理视觉刺激的部分。该部分在进化过程中得以充分的发展，这也是为什么我们常常会说一图胜千言。事实上，如果你观察一幅图片中的细节以及记忆这些细节的容易程度，你会发现，我们的语言能力相较于视觉处理能力真是差太多了。对于记忆也是如此，用图片展示的信息通常不太容易忘记。</p>
<p>当然，组织一道简单的问答题比找到一幅切题的图片要花费更少的时间。这也是为什么当你在学习过程使用图片时，往往需要在性价比上做出权衡。使用得当的图片，在诸如解剖学，地理学，几何学，化学和历史等领域，会极大的减少你的学习时间。</p>
<p>图片的威力也解释了为什么托尼·博赞的思维导图概念会如此流行。思维导图是一种将各组成部分连接起来的抽象图片，以此来反映个体概念间的逻辑关联。</p>

<h2 id="原则七使用助记技巧">原则七：使用助记技巧</h2>
<p>助记技巧是那些使我们更容易记忆的技巧。这些技巧往往有着令人惊讶的效果。对大部分学生来说，10岁少年就能记住50张卡牌排序的景象让人几乎以为发现了少年天才。然而人们惊讶的发现，在一些训练后，掌握这样的技巧是如此的容易。这些技巧每个人都可以获得而不需要而外的能力。</p>
<p>在你开始相信掌握这类技巧将帮你永久解决遗忘的问题之前，要注意了，通往长久而有效记忆的真正瓶颈并不是快速记忆，事实上快速记忆是最容易的部分。真正的瓶颈在于保持数月，数年，甚至终身的记忆！要实现后者，你需要SuperMemo并遵守本文中提到的20条准则。</p>
<p>现在有很多有关助记技巧的书籍，也许托尼·博赞的思维导图是其中最流行和最受重视的。你可以在网上搜索关键词：mind maps(思维导图)，peg lists(记忆宫殿，助记挂钩), mnemonic techniques(助记技巧) 以获得更多信息。</p>
<p>经验表明，在一些训练后，你有意的将助记技巧运用到学习中的例子只占1-5%，但随着时间的推移，你将越来越不自觉地使用这些技巧。</p>
<p>下面是一个思维导图的例子：</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="/asset/mindmap.jpg" alt="mindmap" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h2 id="原则八使用图象填空">原则八：使用图象填空</h2>
<p>图象填空和文字填空一样，只不过是把缺失的文字替换成确实的图象而已。比如：在学习解剖学时，你可以展现一副复杂的图象，有一小部分缺失了。学生的任务是把缺失的部分说出来。同一副图象可以用来组织10-20个知识点，对于每个知识点可用图片中特定的部分来询问。图像填空对于学习地理非常有帮助。</p>
<p>下面是一个图像填空的例子：</p>

<p>红色方块所指向的区域名称是什么？</p>
<h2 id="原则九避免使用集合">原则九：避免使用集合</h2>
<p>集合就是一堆有特定性质的东西的组合<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E9%9B%86%E5%90%88_(%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6)">from wiki</a>。比如：一个水果的集合就是由桃子、梨子、苹果组所组成的。一个典型的例子是，当要求列出一个集合的所有成员时，这样的内容是很难学习的。例如：欧盟的成员国有哪些？因为基于集合的记忆成本非常高，所以你应该尽量避免这种学习方式。如果集合是必须的，那么你应该尝试着把它转化成枚举类型。枚举是有序列表（例如，按照字母顺序排列的欧盟成员国列表）。枚举类型也很难记忆而应尽量避免。然而，枚举相比集合的优势在于它是有序的，它能迫使大脑总是以相同的顺序排列他们。一个排序后的国家列表比无序的列表包含了更多的信息。有点自相矛盾的是，尽管枚举类型包含了更多的信息，它却更容易被记住。其原因在最小信息原则中已经有所讨论：你应该总是让你的大脑以完全相同的方式来重复。在上述集合的例子中，要求每次重复时以不同的顺序列出国家名字对记忆产生的效果是灾难性的。如果不依赖助记技巧，枚举或者分组，要记住有着5个以上内容的集合几乎是不可能的。尽管这么说，你可能常常会下意识的运用这些技巧帮你成功克服这类问题。然而这些技巧，也会让你经常失败。因此，尽量避免使用集合！如果你确实需要使用集合，那么把他们转化为枚举类型，并使用处理枚举类型的技巧来应对。</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>在上面的例子里，我们把15个成员国的集合转换成了9个问题。其中，5个问题是含有2，3项内容的集合，以及1个含有7项内容的枚举。把他放到supermeo里，看看按照历史时间表来产生这么一张欧盟成员表是多么容易。看到使用法国和英国时所用的技巧吗？他们把列在其他问题中的国家连接起来从而简化了学习过程。相比于原问题，可以看到经过良好组织的知识点所含信息量要多的多。那么，随着简化问题的过程，我们学到了更多的知识。每一个问题都有效的遵循了最小信息原则。你可以进一步尝试着把比荷卢联盟拆分，或者用助记技巧来记忆最后的那个枚举列表。当然，只有当你在记忆集合有问题的时候才采取这些分解步骤。(毕竟，分解问题需要额外的时间)</p>
<h2 id="原则十避免使用枚举">原则十：避免使用枚举</h2>
<p>枚举也是那种很难学习的经典类型，但是它依然比集合更容易让人接受。尽量避免使用枚举。如果你实在无法避免，那么使用填空题(如果可能的话，使用重叠式填空)，学习字母表是使用重叠式填空的一个很好的例子。</p>
<h4 id="难以学习的内容">难以学习的内容</h4>

<li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>问：字母表的头三个字母是什么？</p>

<p>问：请列出A。。。E之间缺失的字母</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>问：请列出B。。。F之间缺失的字母</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>答：C，D，E</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>问：请列出C。。。G之间缺失的字母</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>答：D，E，F</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>用上述的内容来学习字母表会更加容易。其优势在于，基于心理上的原因，这种学习方法让人觉得更加容易：学生不会因为要背诵整个字母排列而必须停下来，他只需要专注于学习材料中的一小部分就可以了。在经过重复记忆后，仍然建议他能够把整个字母表背诵下来。然而，一旦他记住了所有单一的片断，背诵整体字母表就应当是愉悦轻快而少有挫折的行为了。</p>
<p>上面的填空就是重叠式填空题。即在记忆中使用不同的问题来加强枚举中相同的部分(比如：在第2第3项问题中要求记起相同的字母序列C-D)。这样的冗余并没有违背最小信息原则，因为这些额外的信息是由额外的问题项填加的。</p>
<p>象集合中的那个例子一样，你还可以用分组的方式来处理枚举(参见“欧盟成员国”的例子)，但是填空题更简单而且在多数情况下应该足够了。</p>
<p>诗词是枚举的一个例子(所有的词句都须以预先安排的顺序说出)。当然，因为词句间很强的语义连接和韵律，往往不需要使用填空的方式，就能有效地记忆诗词，而不会沮丧的反复忘记其中的小片段。然而，一旦你发现在自己记忆诗词上有些磕磕碰碰，那么最好用填空的方式把整个诗词拆解，以确保学习过程快捷简单，有效且愉悦。</p>

<p>这样子是不是看起来有些不自然？当然！但是一旦你使用了这种方法就会知道它多么有效率了。</p>
<h2 id="原则十一与干扰做斗争">原则十一：与干扰做斗争</h2>
<p>当你学习相同的内容时你经常会混淆他们。比如：你可能在区分单词historic和historical时碰到问题。这种情况在你记忆大量数字时会更加明显，例如：在药剂学中药物的最佳剂量。<br>
如果对一项内容的知识使记住另一项内容更加困难了，那么我们称这种情况为记忆干扰。<br>
往往，你可以牢牢的记住某项内容好多年，直到。。。你开始记忆另一项内容，以至于两者都很难记住了！比如，你在学习地理的时候记住了位于委内瑞拉，苏里南和巴西之间的国家是圭亚那。而且，只要复习几次，你就能很容易的回忆起这个事实。然而，一旦你添加了相似的内容并询问所有这些国家以及法属圭亚那和哥伦比亚的位置时，你会突然发现很强的记忆干扰并开始遗忘，简单来说就是，你会混淆，而不知道哪个是哪个了。</p>
<p>对于有经验的SM用户来说，记忆干扰可能是遗忘的最大的一个原因。你永远无法知道它什么时候会发生，应对他的唯一方法就是发现并去除。换而言之，在组织知识点时预测记忆干扰往往是不可能的。干扰可能发生在毫不相干的内容之间，象是Guyana, Guyard, Guyenne(形似？)以及Guyana, kayman and ... aspirin(什么鬼？) 对于你和别的人来说，记忆干扰的作用方式会很不同。这很难预测。</p>
<p>在记忆干扰产生不良影响前，你应该尽可能的防止这种情况。这有助于减少你学习过程的精神压力。下面是一些提示：</p>
<p>让问题尽可能的清晰。</p>
<p>谨遵最小信息原则。(本文剩余的诸多准则都是基于避免干扰的!)</p>
<p>在记忆干扰对你造成困惑之前，一旦发现，要立刻去除。(例如：当你看见单词inept，你想，我知道单词inept和inapt的意思，但我不要知道哪个是哪个)</p>

<h2 id="原则十三联想其他记忆">原则十三：联想其他记忆</h2>
<p>联想其他记忆可以将你的内容置于更好的情境，简化措辞，并且减少干扰。在下面的例子中，使用单词“谦卑” （humble）和“恳求者” （supplicant）可以帮助学生更加关注单词“无耻地” （shamelessly)，因而强化正确的词义。越专注越能消除干扰。其次，如此使用这两个单词也有可能避免其本身“畏缩于”词义所带来的干扰。最后，所提到的措辞更加的简单明确。应用“构建于基础”和“不理解，不要学”这两条规则，自然地要求事先（或与此同时）得明白“谦卑”和“恳求者”（你需要联想的单词）的意思。</p>

<h2 id="原则十四让材料与你个人相关并且给出例子">原则十四：让材料与你个人相关并且给出例子</h2>
<p>最有效的强化记忆的方式之一就是建立记忆内容与你个人生活的联系。在下面的例子中，与其试图描绘出一幅可以恰当地阐释该问题的画面，不如使用与你个人生活相关的线索，这样更能缩短记忆需要的时间。</p>
<h4 id="较难的学习项">较难的学习项</h4>
<ul>
<li>问：What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back?</li>
<li>答：divan (单词解释：沙发床，尤指靠墙有枕头的沙发)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="较简单的学习项">较简单的学习项</h4>
<ul>
<li>问：What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back? (就像罗伯特他爸妈家那张那种)</li>
<li>答：divan</li>
</ul>
<p>如果你能准确地回想起罗伯特爸妈家的那个软床是什么类型的，你就会省下很多时间，因为不必去一丁点不差地理解这个单词的释义是什么意思，并且/或者去给问题中的家具找合适的配图。个人化的例子有非常好的抗记忆干扰作用(参考第11条)，并且可以极大地缩短学习时间。</p>
<h2 id="原则十五借助情绪的状态">原则十五：借助情绪的状态</h2>
<p>如果你能够用生动甚至令人震惊的例子来阐释你的学习项(item)，你很可能会强化索回(retrieval，从记忆里回想起事实、概念、事件等信息的精神活动)(只要你不过度使用同一套工具乃至受到记忆干扰(interference 参考第 11 条)的影响！) 你的学习项的呈现方式可能会因此有点诡异，但只要这些内容都是给你自己一个人学的，能保证学习效果的方式都是可以的。可以用到一些能够唤起具体且强烈情绪的东西，如：爱情、性、战争、你已故的亲属、你迷恋的对象、<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Tripp">Linda Tripp</a>、纳尔逊·曼德拉，等等。众所周知，情绪状态可以强化回想活动；但是，你应该确保你不会在需要索回某个真实生活场景的记忆片段时，没有必要的情绪线索(emotional clues)可以用。</p>
<h4 id="较困难的学习项">较困难的学习项</h4>
<ul>
<li>问：a light and joking conversation</li>
<li>答：banter (单词解释：轻松、幽默的谈话)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="较简单的学习项-2">较简单的学习项</h4>
<ul>
<li>问：a light and joking conversation (比方说，曼德拉与<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._de_Klerk?oldformat=true">戴克拉克</a>)</li>
<li>答：banter (单词解释：轻松、幽默的谈话)</li>
</ul>
<p>如果你对纳尔逊·曼德拉与F.W.戴克拉克那场会面的印象是生动且正面的话，你很可能会领会到 banter 这个词的意思了。没有这个例子的话，你可能会受到来自 badinage 甚至 chat 这样的词的记忆干扰。这个例子并没有唤起不相干的情绪的风险，因为它唤起的情绪状态可以帮我们定义要学的概念！一个深思熟虑过的例子可能会帮你降低好几倍的记忆所需时间！我记录了一些曾经一年被遗忘过20次的学习项，它们先前都是没有被配上合适的例子的，而这同一个学习项在被配上了一个精妙的，抗干扰的例子之后，在5年跨度上的10轮重复中都没有再被忘记过一次。这基本上相当于<strong>在20年期间节约了25倍的时间</strong>！这样的例子并不少见！它们有效地运用了前面讲到的记忆原则，包括第4条简洁原则，和第11条抗干扰原则。</p>
<p>##原则十六： 利用上下文简化item的写法(本节待修改)</p>
<p>在SuperMemo中你可以使用类来简化你的item，为不同知识分支 赋予不同的外观（利用模板），使用参考标签（标题、作者、日期等），并注明子类别（例如使用不同字符简写来表示，化学的使用chem表示，数学的使用 math表示）。这将帮助你简化你对item的表述，减缓你对问题复杂表述的压力。下面的例子中，定义明确的前缀bioch：为你节省了大量输入与阅读的时间，同时也确保你不会混淆GRE与Graduate Record Examination。推荐在处理item时，从 bioch标签开始，能迅速的将你大脑的记忆置于合适的情境中。在处理一些小的细节时，你可能能在短短的几毫秒就能想起GRE的正确含义，但是更糟糕的事情是，你会进入记忆错误的区域，让你的记忆产生干扰。</p>
<p>##原则十七：冗余但不违背最小信息原则(本节待修改)</p>
<p>冗余通俗地讲就是比你需要的信息多或者信息的重复。冗余与最小信息原则不相互驳斥，甚至还乐于接受更多的信息。why？嘿嘿！冗余本身的词义的问题太过宽泛了。这里有些例子只是为了说明，不能把最小信息原则理解的太狭隘：不能理解为你item表述的字符数量越少越优。</p>
<p>被动与主动的做法如果你正在学习一门外语。例如：世界语：你会经常构建一些词组如：phone-telefono，language-lingvo，hope-esperanto等等。这些词组需要对外来词汇进行主动回忆。不进行主动回忆，保持被动的认知，你可能在记忆telefono-phone, lingvo-language, 或者 esperanto-hope时失败。添加新的元素以后交换问题与答案在某些情况下可能是多余的，但是它不会违背最小信息原则。你的item可能变得更加简并且让你对元素的含义了解的更加深刻。</p>
<p>快捷键：Ctrl+Shift+S 交换问题与答案</p>
<p>推理线索</p>
<p>你经常想通过寻求一个问题的解决办法来提高你的推理能力。你不是紧紧想只是记忆问题的答案，更多的是想快速掌握问题的推理步骤（就像解一个数学公式一样），以此来得到正确的答案。基于这种情况，在解决问题的步骤上提供一些提示，只是帮助你在重复复习的路上不会走偏（提示让我想到了一本书波利亚的《怎样解题》，教你怎样解数学题，但是对于解决问题很有帮助。解决问题就是需要有不断进步的标志来验证自己解决问题的思路是正确的，以此来树立解决问题的信心）</p>
<p>推导解决问题的步骤</p>
<p>在解决更复杂的问题时，记住单步的解决步骤，是很值的借鉴的。（例如解复杂的数学题）这不是临时抱佛脚。这是确保大脑解决问题总是遵循最快捷的路径。想了解更多关于智力与创造力的知识，可以参阅：https://www.supermemo.com/articles/genius.htm</p>

<p>使用多种方式展显知识</p>
<p>同样的知识从不同的角度看，将会有不同的表现形式。针对同一个知识或规则应用不同的方式进行记忆是很不错的（PS：充分利用SuperMemo多样的题型）将会大幅度增加回忆率（超过给定的遗忘指数）</p>
<h2 id="原则十六参考提示简化了措辞">原则十六：参考提示简化了措辞</h2>
<p>您可以在<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/articles/soft/sm10.htm">SuperMemo 2000/2002</a>中使用<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/help/categs.htm">目录(Catagories)</a>，提供具有不同外观的不同知识分支(不同的<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/help/templates.htm">模板</a>)，使用参考标签(#Title，#Author，#Date，等)并清楚地标签子类别(例如，使用#chem 作为对<em>chemistry</em> 的标记，#math 作为对 <em>mathematics</em>的标记，等这种字符串)。这将有助于您简化项目的措辞，因为您无需指定问题的参考。在下面的示例中，明确定义的前缀<em>bioch：<em>可以为您节省大量的输入和大量的阅读的时间，同时仍然确保您不会将 GRE 缩写与研究生入学考试混淆。请注意，在推荐的情况下，您将处理从标签</em>bioch</em>开始的项目，该标签会立即将您的大脑置于正确的参考中。在处理较差的最佳情况时，你会浪费宝贵的时间来回想GRE的标准含义......更糟糕的是......你会点亮大脑中可能容易受到干扰的错误区域！</p>

<h2 id="原则十七冗余与最低信息原则并不矛盾">原则十七：冗余与最低信息原则并不矛盾</h2>
<p><strong>冗余</strong>简单来说就是信息多于需要的或重复信息等。冗余不必,也不会与<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules#minimum%20information%20principle">最小信息原则</a>相矛盾，甚至可能是受您欢迎的。对于这个简短的文本，冗余的问题太宽泛了。以下是一些示例，仅用于说明<em>最小信息原则</em>不能理解为<em>集合甚至项目中的最小字符数或位数</em>：</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>被动和主动的方法</p>
<p>：如果您在学习外语，例如世界语，你通常会建立单词对，如phone-telefono， language-lingvo， hope-esperanto等。这些单词对需要主动回忆外语单词。但是，主动回忆并不能保证被动的辨认，您可能会因换了一种形式，就例如调转为telefono-phone，lingvo-language， 或者esperanto-hope而失败。</p>
<p>添加带有交换问题和答案的新元素在某些情况下可能是多余的，但它与最低信息原则并不矛盾！您的项目仍然尽可能简单。你只是得到了更多</p>
<blockquote>
<p>在<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/articles/soft/sm10.htm">SuperMemo 2000/2002</a>中，您可以使用<strong>Duplicate</strong>( <em>Ctrl+Alt+D</em> )和<strong>Swap</strong> <em>(Ctrl+Shift+S)</em> 快速生成交换的单词对项目</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>推理线索</strong>：你经常想通过取得问题的解决方案来提高你的推理能力。而不仅仅是<em>记忆(memorizing)<em>答案，您希望快速遵循推理步骤(例如，求解一个简单的数学方程式)并</em>生成</em>答案。在这种情况下，提供答案中推理步骤的提示只会帮助您在重复时始终遵循正确的道路</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>推导步骤</strong>：在要解决的更复杂问题中，强烈建议记住个别推导步骤(例如，解决复杂的数学问题)。这不是填鸭！它确保大脑在解决问题的同时始终遵循最快的路径方法。有关提高创造力和智力的更多信息，请阅读：<a href="http://supermemo.com/articles/genius.htm">天才和创造力的根源</a>，以及更具体的：<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/ks.htm#Intelligence">推导，推理和智能</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>多语义表示</strong>：通常可以从不同角度表示和查看相同的知识。在给定记忆具有高价值的情况下，建议记住相同事实或规则的不同表示。这将增加预期的回忆率(超过<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/help/fi.htm">遗忘指数</a>指定的召回率！</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>灵活重复</strong>：如果对同一个问题有很多有效的回答，请确保您的代表能够确定等效性，并通过提供一个等效选项来给您良好的成绩。例如，如果您学习一门语言，那么学习符合概念定义的所有同义词并不是一件好事。将单个同义词视为对这个问题的一个足够的答案(例如<em>a mark made by ink spilt on sth</em> = <em>blot/blob/blotch</em>),这能够让您的项目更为明确及充足</p>

<h2 id="原则十八提供信息来源">原则十八：提供信息来源</h2>
<p>除了已充分验证的知识(比如2+2=4)，建议你加上收集的知识素材的来源出处.在现实场景中经常会遇到对信息可信度的挑战,那这时信息的来源出处就能帮上忙.信息来源渠道不同, 事实和数据也会有差别；你可能会惊讶地发现,一家信誉良好的信息机构发布和其知名同行极其不同的数据.如果没有SuperMemo,这些差异往往难以被注意到：因为经常是遇到新事实之前，旧的信息已早被遗忘。有资料来源，就能据此更可靠地推测选择哪些信息是更为可信的。要进一步增加可信度，添加标签也十分有用(例如: “注意!” “有其他不同来源!”等).信息来源应该是伴随该知识条目，而非本身变成需要学习知识的一部分，除非它对你回忆起该知识十分关键.</p>
<h2 id="原则十九提供时间戳标记">原则十九：提供时间戳标记</h2>
<p>有的知识体系如基础数学,解剖学,分类学和自然地理是相对稳定的;而经济指数,高新技术,个人数据等则信息则富于变化. 所以提供时间戳标记或者表明信息过期程度的标签变得十分重要. 处理统计数据时,你可以用收集年份给数据”盖戳”；学习软件应用时,按照软件版本标记就足够.有了新数据后,你可以更新相关的项目.不幸的是,在大多数情况下你都不得不重新记一遍早已过时的知识;然你几乎不会想要记住时间戳标记本身.如果你想记住在既定时间内某一特定数据的变化(比如不同年份的国民生产总值),时间戳标记此时本身就成为需要学习的知识.</p>
<h2 id="原则二十确定优先顺序">原则二十：确定优先顺序</h2>
<p>你将经常面临有知识太多没法完全掌握的问题。因此长远来说确定优先顺序对于建立有效知识十分关键。如何确定优先顺序将会影响到你的知识储备方式以及学习速度(参照 “learn basics first”部分). 许多阶段都会要确定优先顺序;极少数是和”知识展示”相关,但全部都很重要:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>优先信息来源- 你的知识素材来源经常不止一个. 如果你尚在求学,信息来源最有可能是不同学科的书籍和笔记. 其他则可能是依靠期刊,网络,电视,报纸,百科全书,词典等信息来源.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>提取知识-记忆整本书籍或者文章几近不甚明智,除非有重要考试需要背考.你需要提取的是最可能影响知识信息质量的部分. 可以通过如下方式做到: 1.标记书籍或者期刊的段落; 2. 将相关网页复制到SuperMemo; 3.将相关文章段落复制到SuperMemo; 4. 将事实和数据直接添加到SuperMemo的笔记中. 你需要有一定的经验积累，才能正确衡量大脑能够接收的知识量以及你实际能掌握的细节精准度.而借助增量阅读工具是将知识流纳入记忆的最佳方式.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>将知识转移至SuperMemo.你可以在SuperMomo添加素材阶段起运用SuperMemo组织知识的20条规则.然也可以直接将笔记或者完整的文件直接先添加进SuperMemo,然后再用SuperMemo提供的机制决定导入材料的处理顺序.决定是直接原样导入还是先组织优化的最好标尺是看精确组织导入材料的需要耗时. 如果组织知识需要耗费更多的信息和时间,那就直接导入材料; 如果正确组织一个类项只需数秒,那就先组织好再导入.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>组织信息条目-确保答案的解释或者补充内容放进括号里,这样你的注意力就集中在最重要的条目部分. 可以在结合上下文重复增强记忆时阅读括号里的内容.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>运用遗忘指数-你可以使用遗忘指数优先排列待复习的内容条目. SuperMemo默认设定了重复记忆的顺序,但是你可以分别调高更为重要内容、降低低优先级别内容的识记率.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>学习-设置优先级别的过程并不是开始重复记忆阶段了就此结束.你可以用以下工具在学习进程中继续设置优先级别:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+M         记忆-在给定时间内重新记一遍对知识架构特别重要的或者发生改  变的高优先级别条目项.如果你选择使用Ctrl+M,可以改变正在复习的内容下次何时出现(之前的重复计数将会清零).建议要经常重新学习内容有极大变化的相关条目项.</li>
<li>Ctrl+L         重设-手动设置下次重复的日期.</li>
<li>Ctrl+Shift+R   执行复习-手动提前复习还没有到期的内容(例如需要重温特别重要的材料)</li>
<li>Ctrl+R         后置遗忘-将条目项从当前学习内容移除并移动到等待学习队列末尾.</li>
<li>Ctrl+D         忽略-直接在学习进程中忽略当前条目项.</li>
<li>Ctrl+Shift+Del 删除-从文件夹中删除当前条目项.</li>
<li>Ctrl+Shift+P   改变已背条目项的遗忘指数或者排队条目项的序列.</li>

<p>Author’s Note</p>
<p>THE YEARS, OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU, when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, the scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.</p>
<p>C. G. JUNG, 1957</p>
<p>Preface to the Reader’s Edition</p>
<p>More than a decade has passed since the memorable decision of the former society of heirs of C. G. Jung to release <em>The Red Book</em> for publication. Much consideration was given to what kind of audience this multilayered work should be directed: Professional readers of works on the history of psychology? The general reader? Visually receptive people, orientated toward images? Lovers of calligraphy? Collectors of beautiful books? Which aspects should the format and design of the publication foreground? These questions weren’t easy to answer, since even the physical appearance of the precious original seemed to contain a message. Many proposals were discussed and discarded. It was W. W. Norton that finally found the appropriate solution: a complete facsimile edition, which was presented in its original format in 2009. Overwhelming success proved that the publisher was right. The work rapidly spread worldwide and is already available in nine languages. Evidently, it was possible to design an edition that did justice not only to the many facets of the work but also to the different types of audience. The list of people to whom the credit for this success is due is now of considerable length. However, two names especially deserve to be mentioned, Jim Mairs (W. W. Norton) and Sonu Shamdasani (Philemon Foundation).</p>
<p>The present Reader’s Edition contains the complete text of the original. It is specifically aimed toward those who would like to engage deeply with the literary documentation of Jung’s inner development. It would undoubtedly accord with Jung’s intention if this edition helps readers to make their reading more fruitful for their own development.</p>

<p>Preface</p>
<p>Since 1962, the existence of C. G. Jung’s <em>Red Book</em> has been widely known. Yet only with the present publication is it finally accessible to a broad public. Its genesis is described in Jung’s <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>, and has been the subject of numerous discussions in the secondary literature. Hence I will only briefly outline it here.</p>
<p>The year 1913 was pivotal in Jung’s life. He began a self-experiment that became known as his “confrontation with the unconscious” and lasted until 1930. During this experiment, he developed a technique to “get to the bottom of [his] inner processes,” “to translate the emotions into images,” and “to grasp the fantasies which were stirring . . . ‘underground.’ ” He later called this method “active imagination.” He first recorded these fantasies in his <em>Black Books</em>. He then revised these texts, added reflections on them, and copied them in a calligraphic script into a book entitled <em>Liber Novus</em> bound in red leather, accompanied by his own paintings. It has always been known as the <em>Red Book</em>.</p>
<p>Jung shared his inner experiences with his wife and close associates. In 1925 he gave a report of his professional and personal development in a series of seminars at the Psychological Club in Zürich in which he also mentioned his method of active imagination. Beyond this, Jung was guarded. His children, for example, were not informed about his self-experiment and they did not notice anything unusual. Clearly, it would have been difficult for him to explain what was taking place. It was already a mark of favor if he allowed one of his children to watch him write or paint. Thus for Jung’s descendants, the <em>Red Book</em> had always been surrounded by an aura of mystery. In 1930 Jung ended his experiment and put the <em>Red Book</em> aside—unfinished. Although it had its honored place in his study, he let it rest for decades. Meanwhile the insights he had gained through it directly informed his subsequent writings. In 1959, with the help of the old draft, he tried to complete the transcription of the text into the <em>Red Book</em> and to finish an incomplete painting. He also started on an epilogue, but for unknown reasons both the calligraphic text and epilogue break off in midsentence.</p>
<p>Although Jung actively considered publishing the <em>Red Book</em>, he never took the necessary steps. In 1916 he privately published the <em>Septem Sermones ad Mortuos</em> (Seven Sermons to the Dead), a short work that arose out of his confrontation with the unconscious. Even his 1916 essay, “The Transcendent Function,” in which he described the technique of active imagination, was not published until 1958. There are a number of reasons why he did not publish the <em>Red Book</em>. As he himself stated, it was unfinished. His growing interest in alchemy as a research topic distracted him. In hindsight, he described the detailed working out of his fantasies in the <em>Red Book</em> as a necessary but annoying “aestheticizing elaboration.” As late as 1957 he declared that the <em>Black Books</em> and the <em>Red Book</em> were autobiographical records that he did not want published in his <em>Collected Works</em> because they were not of a scholarly character. As a concession, he allowed Aniela Jaffé to quote excerpts from the <em>Red Book</em> and the <em>Black Books</em> in <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>—a possibility which she made little use of.</p>
<p>In 1961, Jung died. His literary estate became the property of his descendants, who formed the Society of Heirs of C. G. Jung. The inheritance of Jung’s literary rights brought an obligation and challenge to his heirs: to see through the publication of the German edition of his <em>Collected Works</em>. In his will, Jung had expressed the wish that the <em>Red Book</em> and the <em>Black Books</em> should remain with his family, without, however, giving more detailed instructions. Since the <em>Red Book</em> was not meant to be published in the <em>Collected Works</em>, the Society of Heirs concluded that this was Jung’s final wish concerning the work, and that it was an entirely private matter. The Society of Heirs guarded Jung’s unpublished writings like a treasure; no further publications were considered. The <em>Red Book</em> remained in Jung’s study for more than twenty years, entrusted to the care of Franz Jung, who had taken over his father’s house.</p>
<p>In 1983 the Society of Heirs placed the <em>Red Book</em> in a safe-deposit box, knowing that it was an irreplaceable document. In 1984 the newly appointed executive committee had five photographic duplicates made for family use. For the first time, Jung’s descendants now had the opportunity to take a close look at it. This careful handling had its benefits. The <em>Red Book</em>’s well-preserved state is due, among other things, to the fact that it has only rarely been opened in decades.</p>
<p>When, after 1990, the editing of the German <em>Collected Works</em>—a <em>selection</em> of works—was drawing to a conclusion, the executive committee decided to start looking through all the accessible unpublished material with an eye to further publications. I took up this task, because in 1994, the Society of Heirs had placed the responsibility for archival and editorial questions on me. It turned out that there was an entire corpus of drafts and variants pertaining to the <em>Red Book</em>. From this it emerged that the missing part of the calligraphic text existed as a draft and that there was a manuscript entitled “Scrutinies,” which continued where the draft ended, containing the <em>Seven Sermons</em>. Yet whether and how this substantial material could be published remained an open question. At first glance, the style and content appeared to have little in common with Jung’s other works. Much was unclear and by the mid-1990s there was no one left who could have provided firsthand information on these points.</p>
<p>However, since Jung’s time, the history of psychology had been gaining in importance and could now offer a new approach. While working on other projects I had come in contact with Sonu Shamdasani. In extensive talks we discussed the possibility of further Jung publications, both in general terms as well as with regard to the <em>Red Book</em>. The book had emerged within a specific context with which a reader at the turn of the twenty-first century is no longer familiar. But a historian of psychology would be able to present it to the modern reader as a historical document. With the help of primary sources he could embed it in the cultural context of its genesis, situate it within the history of science, and relate it to Jung’s life and works. In 1999 Sonu Shamdasani developed a publication proposal following these guiding principles. On the basis of this proposal the Society of Heirs decided in spring 2000—not without discussion—to release the <em>Red Book</em> for publication and to hand over the task of editing it to Sonu Shamdasani.</p>
<p>I have been asked repeatedly why, after so many years, the <em>Red Book</em> is now being published. Some new understandings on our part played a major role: Jung himself did not—as it had seemed—consider the <em>Red Book</em> a secret. On several occasions the text contains the address “dear friends”; it is, in other words, directed at an audience. Indeed, Jung let close friends have copies of transcriptions and discussed these with them. He did not categorically rule out publication; he simply left the issue unresolved. Moreover, Jung himself stated that he had gained the material for all his later works from his confrontation with the unconscious. As a record of this confrontation the <em>Red Book</em> is thus, beyond the private sphere, central to Jung’s works. This understanding allowed the generation of Jung’s grandchildren to look at the situation in a new light. The decision-making process took time. Exemplary excerpts, concepts, and information helped them to deal more rationally with an emotionally charged matter. Finally, the Society of Heirs decided democratically that the <em>Red Book</em> could be published. It was a long journey from that decision to the present publication. The result is impressive. This edition would not have been possible without the cooperation of many people who devoted their skill and energy to a common goal.</p>
<p>On behalf of the descendants of C. G. Jung, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the contributors.</p>

<p>Foundation of the Works of C. G. Jung</p>
<p>Liber Novus</p>
<p>The “Red Book”<br>
of C. G. Jung1</p>
<p>SONU SHAMDASANI</p>
<p>C. G. Jung is widely recognized as a major figure in modern Western thought, and his work continues to spark controversies. He played critical roles in the formation of modern psychology, psychotherapy, and psychiatry, and a large international profession of analytical psychologists work under his name. His work has had its widest impact, however, outside professional circles: Jung and Freud are the names that most people first think of in connection with psychology, and their ideas have been widely disseminated in the arts, the humanities, films, and popular culture. Jung is also widely regarded as one of the instigators of the New Age movement. However, it is startling to realize that the book that stands at the center of his oeuvre, on which he worked for over sixteen years, is only now being published.</p>
<p>There can be few <em>unpublished</em> works that have already exerted such far-reaching effects upon twentieth-century social and intellectual history as Jung’s <em>Red Book</em>, or <em>Liber Novu</em>s (New Book). Nominated by Jung to contain the nucleus of his later works, it has long been recognized as the key to comprehending their genesis. Yet aside from a few tantalizing glimpses, it has remained unavailable for study.</p>
<p>The Cultural Moment</p>
<p>The first few decades of the twentieth century saw a great deal of experimentation in literature, psychology, and the visual arts. Writers tried to throw off the limitations of representational conventions to explore and depict the full range of inner experience—dreams, visions, and fantasies. They experimented with new forms and utilized old forms in novel ways. From the automatic writing of the surrealists to the gothic fantasies of Gustav Meyrink, writers came into close proximity and collision with the researches of psychologists, who were engaged in similar explorations. Artists and writers collaborated to try out new forms of illustration and typography, new configurations of text and image. Psychologists sought to overcome the limitations of philosophical psychology, and they began to explore the same terrain as artists and writers. Clear demarcations among literature, art, and psychology had not yet been set; writers and artists borrowed from psychologists, and vice versa. A number of major psychologists, such as Alfred Binet and Charles Richet, wrote dramatic and fictional works, often under assumed names, whose themes mirrored those of their “scientific” works.2 Gustav Fechner, one of the founders of psychophysics and experimental psychology, wrote on the soul life of plants and of the earth as a blue angel.3 Meanwhile writers such as André Breton and Philippe Soupault assiduously read and utilized the works of psychical researchers and abnormal psychologists, such as Frederick Myers, Théodore Flournoy, and Pierre Janet. W. B. Yeats utilized spiritualistic automatic writing to compose a poetic psychocosmology in <em>A Vision</em>.4 On all sides, individuals were searching for new forms with which to depict the actualities of inner experience, in a quest for spiritual and cultural renewal. In Berlin, Hugo Ball noted:</p>
<p>The world and society in 1913 looked like this: life is completely confined and shackled. A kind of economic fatalism prevails; each individual, whether he resists it or not, is assigned a specific role and with it his interests and his character. The church is regarded as a “redemption factory” of little importance, literature as a safety valve . . . The most burning question day and night is: is there anywhere a force that is strong enough to put an end to this state of affairs? And if not, how can one escape it?5</p>
<p>Within this cultural crisis Jung conceived of undertaking an extended process of self-experimentation, which resulted in <em>Liber Novus</em>, a work of psychology in a literary form.</p>
<p>We stand today on the other side of a divide between psychology and literature. To consider <em>Liber Novus</em> today is to take up a work that could have emerged only before these separations had been firmly established. Its study helps us understand how the divide occurred. But first, we may ask,</p>
<p>Who was C. G. Jung?</p>
<p>Jung was born in Kesswil, on Lake Constance, in 1875. His family moved to Laufen by the Rhine Falls when he was six months old. He was the oldest child and had one sister. His father was a pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church. Toward the end of his life, Jung wrote a memoir entitled “From the Earliest Experiences of My Life,” which was subsequently included in <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em> in a heavily edited form.6 Jung narrated the significant events that led to his psychological vocation. The memoir, with its focus on significant childhood dreams, visions, and fantasies, can be viewed as an introduction to <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>In the first dream, he found himself in a meadow with a stone-lined hole in the ground. Finding some stairs, he descended into it, and found himself in a chamber. Here there was a golden throne with what appeared to be a tree trunk of skin and flesh, with an eye on the top. He then heard his mother’s voice exclaim that this was the “man-eater.” He was unsure whether she meant that this figure actually devoured children or was identical with Christ. This profoundly affected his image of Christ. Years later, he realized that this figure was a penis and, later still, that it was in fact a ritual phallus, and that the setting was an underground temple. He came to see this dream as an initiation “in the secrets of the earth.”7</p>
<p>In his childhood, Jung experienced a number of visual hallucinations. He also appears to have had the capacity to evoke images voluntarily. In a seminar in 1935, he recalled a portrait of his maternal grandmother which he would look at as a boy until he “saw” his grandfather descending the stairs.8</p>
<p>One sunny day, when Jung was twelve, he was traversing the Münsterplatz in Basel, admiring the sun shining on the newly restored glazed roof tiles of the cathedral. He then felt the approach of a terrible, sinful thought, which he pushed away. He was in a state of anguish for several days. Finally, after convincing himself that it was God who wanted him to think this thought, just as it had been God who had wanted Adam and Eve to sin, he let himself contemplate it, and saw God on his throne unleashing an almighty turd on the cathedral, shattering its new roof and smashing the cathedral. With this, Jung felt a sense of bliss and relief such as he had never experienced before. He felt that it was an experience of the “direct living God, who stands omnipotent and free above the Bible and Church.”9 He felt alone before God, and that his real responsibility commenced then. He realized that it was precisely such a direct, immediate experience of the living God, who stands outside Church and Bible, that his father lacked.</p>
<p>This sense of election led to a final disillusionment with the Church on the occasion of his First Communion. He had been led to believe that this would be a great experience. Instead, nothing. He concluded: “For me, it was an absence of God and no religion. Church was a place to which I no longer could go. There was no life there, but death.”10</p>
<p>Jung’s voracious reading started at this time, and he was particularly struck by Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>. He was struck by the fact that in Mephistopheles, Goethe took the figure of the devil seriously. In philosophy, he was impressed by Schopenhauer, who acknowledged the existence of evil and gave voice to the sufferings and miseries of the world.</p>
<p>Jung also had a sense of living in two centuries, and felt a strong nostalgia for the eighteenth century. His sense of duality took the form of two alternating personalities, which he dubbed NO. 1 and 2. NO. 1 was the Basel schoolboy, who read novels, and NO. 2 pursued religious reflections in solitude, in a state of communion with nature and the cosmos. He inhabited “God’s world.” This personality felt most real. Personality NO. 1 wanted to be free of the melancholy and isolation of personality NO. 2. When personality NO. 2 entered, it felt as if a long dead yet perpetually present spirit had entered the room. NO. 2 had no definable character. He was connected to history, particularly with the Middle Ages. For NO. 2, NO. 1, with his failings and ineptitudes, was someone to be put up with. This interplay ran throughout Jung’s life. As he saw it, we are all like this—part of us lives in the present and the other part is connected to the centuries.</p>
<p>As the time drew near for him to choose a career, the conflict between the two personalities intensified. NO. 1 wanted to pursue science, NO. 2, the humanities. Jung then had two critical dreams. In the first, he was walking in a dark wood along the Rhine. He came upon a burial mound and began to dig, until he discovered the remains of prehistoric animals. This dream awakened his desire to learn more about nature. In the second dream, he was in a wood and there were watercourses. He found a circular pool surrounded by dense undergrowth. In the pool, he saw a beautiful creature, a large radiolarian. After these dreams, he settled for science. To solve the question of how to earn a living, he decided to study medicine. He then had another dream. He was in an unknown place, surrounded by fog, making slow headway against the wind. He was protecting a small light from going out. He saw a large black figure threateningly close. He awoke, and realized that the figure was the shadow cast from the light. He thought that in the dream, NO. 1 was himself bearing the light, and NO. 2 followed like a shadow. He took this as a sign that he should go forward with NO. 1, and not look back to the world of NO. 2.</p>
<p>In his university days, the interplay between these personalities continued. In addition to his medical studies, Jung pursued an intensive program of extracurricular reading, in particular the works of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Swedenborg,11 and writers on spiritualism. Nietzsche’s <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> made a great impression on him. He felt that his own personality NO. 2 corresponded to Zarathustra, and he feared that his personality NO. 2 was similarly morbid.12 He participated in a student debating society, the Zofingia society, and presented lectures on these subjects. Spiritualism particularly interested him, as the spiritualists appeared to be attempting to use scientific means to explore the supernatural, and prove the immortality of the soul.</p>
<p>The latter half of the nineteenth century witnessed the emergence of modern spiritualism, which spread across Europe and America. Through spiritualism, the cultivation of trances—with the attendant phenomena of trance speech, glossolalia, automatic writing, and crystal vision—became widespread. The phenomena of spiritualism attracted the interest of leading scientists such as Crookes, Zollner, and Wallace. It also attracted the interest of psychologists, including Freud, Ferenczi, Bleuler, James, Myers, Janet, Bergson, Stanley Hall, Schrenck-Notzing, Moll, Dessoir, Richet, and Flournoy.</p>
<p>During his university days in Basel, Jung and his fellow students took part in séances. In 1896, they engaged in a long series of sittings with his cousin Helene Preiswerk, who appeared to have mediumistic abilities. Jung found that during the trances, she would become different personalities, and that he could call up these personalities by suggestion. Dead relatives appeared, and she became completely transformed into these figures. She unfolded stories of her previous incarnations and articulated a mystical cosmology, represented in a mandala.13 Her spiritualistic revelations carried on until she was caught attempting to fake physical apparitions, and the séances were discontinued.</p>
<p>On reading Richard von Krafft-Ebing’s <em>Text-Book of Psychiatry</em> in 1899, Jung realized that his vocation lay in psychiatry, which represented a fusion of the interests of his two personalities. He underwent something like a conversion to a natural scientific framework. After his medical studies, he took up a post as an assistant physician at Burghölzli hospital at the end of 1900. The Burghölzli was a progressive university clinic, under the directorship of Eugen Bleuler. At the end of the nineteenth century, numerous figures attempted to found a new scientific psychology. It was held that by turning psychology into a science through introducing scientific methods, all prior forms of human understanding would be revolutionized. The new psychology was heralded as promising nothing less than the completion of the scientific revolution. Thanks to Bleuler, and his predecessor Auguste Forel, psychological research and hypnosis played prominent roles at the Burghölzli.</p>
<p>Jung’s medical dissertation focused on the psychogenesis of spiritualistic phenomena, in the form of an analysis of his séances with Helene Preiswerk.14 While his initial interest in her case appeared to be in the possible veracity of her spiritualistic manifestations, in the interim, he had studied the works of Frederic Myers, William James, and, in particular, Théodore Flournoy. At the end of 1899, Flournoy had published a study of a medium, whom he called Hélène Smith, which became a best seller.15 What was novel about Flournoy’s study was that it approached her case purely from the psychological angle, as a means of illuminating the study of subliminal consciousness. A critical shift had taken place through the work of Flournoy, Frederick Myers, and William James.They argued that regardless of whether the alleged spiritualistic experiences were valid, such experiences enabled far-reaching insight into the constitution of the subliminal, and hence into human psychology as a whole. Through them, mediums became important subjects of the new psychology. With this shift, the methods used by the mediums—such as automatic writing, trance speech, and crystal vision—were appropriated by the psychologists, and became prominent experimental research tools. In psychotherapy, Pierre Janet and Morton Prince used automatic writing and crystal gazing as methods for revealing hidden memories and subconscious fixed ideas. Automatic writing brought to light subpersonalities, and enabled dialogues with them to be held.16 For Janet and Prince, the goal of holding such practices was to reintegrate the personality.</p>
<p>Jung was so taken by Flournoy’s book that he offered to translate it into German, but Flournoy already had a translator. The impact of these studies is clear in Jung’s dissertation, where he approaches the case purely from a psychological angle. Jung’s work was closely modeled on Flournoy’s <em>From India to the Planet Mars</em>, both in terms of subject matter and in its interpretation of the psychogenesis of Helene’s spiritualistic romances. Jung’s dissertation also indicates the manner in which he was utilizing automatic writing as a method of psychological investigation.</p>
<p>In 1902, he became engaged to Emma Rauschenbach, whom he married and with whom he had five children. Up till this point, Jung had kept a diary. In one of the last entries, dated May 1902, he wrote: “I am no longer alone with myself, and I can only artificially recall the scary and beautiful feeling of solitude. This is the shadow side of the fortune of love.”17 For Jung, his marriage marked a move away from the solitude to which he had been accustomed.</p>
<p>In his youth, Jung had often visited Basel’s art museum and was particularly drawn to the works of Holbein and Böcklin, as well as to those of the Dutch painters.18 Toward the end of his studies, he was much occupied with painting for about a year. His paintings from this period were landscapes in a representational style, and show highly developed technical skills and fine technical proficiency.19 In 1902/3, Jung left his post at the Burghölzli and went to Paris to study with the leading French psychologist Pierre Janet, who was lecturing at the Collège de France. During his stay, he devoted much time to painting and visiting museums, going frequently to the Louvre. He paid particular attention to ancient art, Egyptian antiquities, the works of the Renaissance, Fra Angelico, Leonardo da Vinci, Rubens, and Frans Hals. He bought paintings and engravings and had paintings copied for the furnishing of his new home. He painted in both oil and watercolor. In January 1903, he went to London and visited its museums, paying particular attention to the Egyptian, Aztec, and Inca collections at the British Museum.20</p>
<p>After his return, he took up a post that had become vacant at the Burghölzli and devoted his research to the analysis of linguistic associations, in collaboration with Franz Riklin. With co-workers, they conducted an extensive series of experiments, which they subjected to statistical analyses. The conceptual basis of Jung’s early work lay in the work of Flournoy and Janet, which he attempted to fuse with the research methodology of Wilhelm Wundt and Emil Kraepelin. Jung and Riklin utilized the associations experiment, devised by Francis Galton and developed in psychology and psychiatry by Wundt, Kraepelin, and Gustav Aschaffenburg. The aim of the research project, instigated by Bleuler, was to provide a quick and reliable means for differential diagnosis. The Burghölzli team failed to come up with this, but they were struck by the significance of disturbances of reaction and prolonged response times. Jung and Riklin argued that these disturbed reactions were due to the presence of emotionally stressed complexes, and used their experiments to develop a general psychology of complexes.21</p>
<p>This work established Jung’s reputation as one of the rising stars of psychiatry. In 1906, he applied his new theory of complexes to study the psychogenesis of dementia praecox (later called schizophrenia) and to demonstrate the intelligibility of delusional formations.22 For Jung, along with a number of other psychiatrists and psychologists at this time, such as Janet and Adolf Meyer, insanity was not regarded as something completely set apart from sanity, but rather as lying on the extreme end of a spectrum. Two years later, he argued that “If we feel our way into the human secrets of the sick person, the madness also reveals its system, and we recognize in the mental illness merely an exceptional reaction to emotional problems which are not strange to us.”23</p>
<p>Jung became increasingly disenchanted by the limitations of experimental and statistical methods in psychiatry and psychology. In the outpatient clinic at the Burghölzli, he presented hypnotic demonstrations. This led to his interest in therapeutics, and to the use of the clinical encounter as a method of research. Around 1904, Bleuler introduced psychoanalysis into the Burghölzli, and entered into a correspondence with Freud, asking Freud for assistance in his analysis of his own dreams.24 In 1906, Jung entered into communication with Freud. This relationship has been much mythologized. A Freudocentric legend arose, which viewed Freud and psychoanalysis as the principal source for Jung’s work. This has led to the complete mislocation of his work in the intellectual history of the twentieth century. On numerous occasions, Jung protested. For instance, in an unpublished article written in the 1930s, “The schism in the Freudian school,” he wrote: “I in no way exclusively stem from Freud. I had my scientific attitude and the theory of complexes before I met Freud. The teachers that influenced me above all are Bleuler, Pierre Janet, and Théodore Flournoy.”25 Freud and Jung clearly came from quite different intellectual traditions, and were drawn together by shared interests in the psychogenesis of mental disorders and psychotherapy. Their intention was to form a scientific psychotherapy based on the new psychology and, in turn, to ground psychology in the in-depth clinical investigation of individual lives.</p>
<p>With the lead of Bleuler and Jung, the Burghölzli became the center of the psychoanalytic movement. In 1908, the <em>Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen</em> (Yearbook for Psychoanalytic and Psychopathological Researches) was established, with Bleuler and Freud editors in chief and Jung as managing editor. Due to their advocacy, psychoanalysis gained a hearing in the German psychiatric world. In 1909, Jung received an honorary degree from Clark University for his association researches. The following year, an international psychoanalytic association was formed with Jung as the president. During the period of his collaboration with Freud, he was a principal architect of the psychoanalytic movement. For Jung, this was a period of intense institutional and political activity. The movement was riven by dissent and acrimonious disagreements.</p>
<p>The Intoxication of Mythology</p>
<p>In 1908, Jung bought some land by the shore of Lake Zürich in Küsnacht and had a house built, where he was to live for the rest of his life. In 1909, he resigned from the Burghölzli, to devote himself to his growing practice and his research interests. His retirement from the Burghölzli coincided with a shift in his research interests to the study of mythology, folklore, and religion, and he assembled a vast private library of scholarly works. These researches culminated in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>, published in two installments in 1911 and 1912. This work can be seen to mark a return to Jung’s intellectual roots and to his cultural and religious preoccupations. He found the mythological work exciting and intoxicating. In 1925 he recalled, “it seemed to me I was living in an insane asylum of my own making. I went about with all these fantastic figures: centaurs, nymphs, satyrs, gods and goddesses, as though they were patients and I was analyzing them. I read a Greek or a Negro myth as if a lunatic were telling me his anamnesis.”26 The end of the nineteenth century had seen an explosion of scholarship in the newly founded disciplines of comparative religion and ethnopsychology. Primary texts were collected and translated for the first time and subjected to historical scholarship in collections such as Max Müller’s <em>Sacred Books of the East</em>.27 For many, these works represented an important relativization of the Christian worldview.</p>
<p>In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>, Jung differentiated two kinds of thinking. Taking his cue from William James, among others, Jung contrasted directed thinking and fantasy thinking. The former was verbal and logical, while the latter was passive, associative, and imagistic. The former was exemplified by science and the latter by mythology. Jung claimed that the ancients lacked a capacity for directed thinking, which was a modern acquisition. Fantasy thinking took place when directed thinking ceased. <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> was an extended study of fantasy thinking, and of the continued presence of mythological themes in the dreams and fantasies of contemporary individuals. Jung reiterated the anthropological equation of the prehistoric, the primitive, and the child. He held that the elucidation of current-day fantasy thinking in adults would concurrently shed light on the thought of children, savages, and prehistoric peoples.28 In this work, Jung synthesized nineteenth-century theories of memory, heredity, and the unconscious and posited a phylogenetic layer to the unconscious that was still present in everyone, consisting of mythological images. For Jung, myths were symbols of the libido and they depicted its typical movements. He used the comparative method of anthropology to draw together a vast panoply of myths, and then subjected them to analytic interpretation. He later termed his use of the comparative method “amplification.” He claimed that there had to be typical myths, which corresponded to the ethnopsychological development of complexes. Following Jacob Burckhardt, Jung termed such typical myths “primordial images” (<em>Urbilder</em>). One particular myth was given a central role: that of the hero. For Jung, this represented the life of the individual, attempting to become independent and to free himself from the mother. He interpreted the incest motif as an attempt to return to the mother to be reborn. He was later to herald this work as marking the discovery of the collective unconscious, though the term itself came at a later date.29</p>
<p>In a series of articles from 1912, Jung’s friend and colleague Alphonse Maeder argued that dreams had a function other than that of wish fulfillment, which was a balancing or compensatory function. Dreams were attempts to solve the individual’s moral conflicts. As such, they did not merely point to the past, but also prepared the way for the future. Maeder was developing Flournoy’s views of the subconscious creative imagination. Jung was working along similar lines, and adopted Maeder’s positions. For Jung and Maeder, this alteration of the conception of the dream brought with it an alteration of all other phenomena associated with the unconscious.</p>
<p>In his preface to the 1952 revision of <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>, Jung wrote that the work was written in 1911, when he was thirty-six: “The time is a critical one, for it marks the beginning of the second half of life, when a metanoia, a mental transformation, not infrequently occurs.”30 He added that he was conscious of the loss of his collaboration with Freud, and was indebted to the support of his wife. After completing the work, he realized the significance of what it meant to live without a myth. One without a myth “is like one uprooted, having no true link either with the past, or with the ancestral life which continues within him, or yet with contemporary human society.”31 As he further describes it:</p>
<p>I was driven to ask myself in all seriousness: “what is the myth you are living?” I found no answer to this question, and had to admit that I was not living with a myth, or even in a myth, but rather in an uncertain cloud of theoretical possibilities which I was beginning to regard with increasing distrust . . . So in the most natural way, I took it upon myself to get to know “my” myth, and I regarded this as the task of tasks—for—so I told myself—how could I, when treating my patients, make due allowance for the personal factor, for my personal equation, which is yet so necessary for a knowledge of the other person, if I was unconscious of it?32</p>
<p>The study of myth had revealed to Jung his mythlessness. He then undertook to get to know his myth, his “personal equation.”33 Thus we see that the self-experimentation which Jung undertook was in part a direct response to theoretical questions raised by his research, which had culminated in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>.</p>
<p>“My Most Difficult Experiment”</p>
<p>In 1912, Jung had some significant dreams that he did not understand. He gave particular importance to two of these, which he felt showed the limitations of Freud’s conceptions of dreams. The first follows:</p>
<p>I was in a southern town, on a rising street with narrow half landings. It was twelve o’clock midday—bright sunshine. An old Austrian customs guard or someone similar passes by me, lost in thought. Someone says, “that is one who cannot die. He died already 30–40 years ago, but has not yet managed to decompose.” I was very surprised. Here a striking figure came, a knight of powerful build, clad in yellowish armor. He looks solid and inscrutable and nothing impresses him. On his back he carries a red Maltese cross. He has continued to exist from the 12th century and daily between 12 and 1 o’clock midday he takes the same route. No one marvels at these two apparitions, but I was extremely surprised.</p>
<p>I hold back my interpretive skills. As regards the old Austrian, Freud occurred to me; as regards the knight, I myself.</p>
<p>Inside, a voice calls, “It is all empty and disgusting.” I must bear it.34</p>
<p>Jung found this dream oppressive and bewildering, and Freud was unable to interpret it.35 Around half a year later Jung had another dream:</p>
<p>I dreamt at that time (it was shortly after Christmas 1912), that I was sitting with my children in a marvelous and richly furnished castle apartment—an open columned hall—we were sitting at a round table, whose top was a marvelous dark green stone. Suddenly a gull or a dove flew in and sprang lightly onto the table. I admonished the children to be quiet, so that they would not scare away the beautiful white bird. Suddenly this bird turned into a child of eight years, a small blond girl, and ran around playing with my children in the marvelous columned colonnades. Then the child suddenly turned into the gull or dove. She said the following to me: “<em>Only in the first hour of the night can I become human, while the male dove is busy with the twelve dead.</em>” With these words the bird flew away and I awoke.36</p>
<p>In <em>Black Book</em> 2, Jung noted that it was this dream that made him decide to embark on a relationship with a woman he had met three years earlier (Toni Wolff).37 In 1925, he remarked that this dream “was the beginning of a conviction that the unconscious did not consist of inert material only, but that there was something living down there.”38 He added that he thought of the story of the <em>Tabula smaragdina</em> (emerald tablet), the twelve apostles, the signs of the Zodiac, and so on, but that he “could make nothing out of the dream except that there was a tremendous animation of the unconscious. I knew no technique of getting at the bottom of this activity; all I could do was just wait, keep on living, and watch the fantasies.”39 These dreams led him to analyze his childhood memories, but this did not resolve anything. He realized that he needed to recover the emotional tone of childhood. He recalled that as a child, he used to like to build houses and other structures, and he took this up again.</p>
<p>While he was engaged in this self-analytic activity, he continued to develop his theoretical work. At the Munich Psycho-Analytical Congress in September 1913, he spoke on psychological types. He argued that there were two basic movements of the libido: extraversion, in which the subject’s interest was oriented toward the outer world, and introversion, in which the subject’s interest was directed inward. Following from this, he posited two types of people, characterized by a predominance of one of these tendencies. The psychologies of Freud and Adler were examples of the fact that psychologies often took what was true of their type as generally valid. Hence what was required was a psychology that did justice to both of these types.40</p>
<p>The following month, on a train journey to Schaffhausen, Jung experienced a waking vision of Europe being devastated by a catastrophic flood, which was repeated two weeks later, on the same journey.41 Commenting on this experience in 1925, he remarked: “I could be taken as Switzerland fenced in by mountains and the submergence of the world could be the debris of my former relationships.” This led him to the following diagnosis of his condition: “I thought to myself, ‘If this means anything, it means that I am hopelessly off.’ ”42 After this experience, Jung feared that he would go mad.43 He recalled that he first thought that the images of the vision indicated a revolution, but as he could not imagine this, he concluded that he was “menaced with a psychosis.”44 After this, he had a similar vision:</p>
<p>In the following winter I was standing at the window one night and looked North. I saw a blood-red glow, like the flicker of the sea seen from afar, stretched from East to West across the northern horizon. And at that time someone asked me what I thought about world events in the near future. I said that I had no thoughts, but saw blood, rivers of blood.45</p>
<p>In the years directly preceding the outbreak of war, apocalyptic imagery was widespread in European arts and literature. For example, in 1912, Wassily Kandinsky wrote of a coming universal catastrophe. From 1912 to 1914, Ludwig Meidner painted a series of works known as the apocalyptic landscapes, with scenes of destroyed cities, corpses, and turmoil.46 Prophecy was in the air. In 1899, the famous American medium Leonora Piper predicted that in the coming century there would be a terrible war in different parts of the world that would cleanse the world and reveal the truths of spiritualism. In 1918, Arthur Conan Doyle, the spiritualist and author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, viewed this as having been prophetic.47</p>
<p>In Jung’s account of the fantasy on the train in <em>Liber Novus</em>, the inner voice said that what the fantasy depicted would become completely real. Initially, he interpreted this subjectively and prospectively, that is, as depicting the imminent destruction of his world. His reaction to this experience was to undertake a psychological investigation of himself. In this epoch, self-experimentation was used in medicine and psychology. Introspection had been one of the main tools of psychological research.</p>
<p>Jung came to realize that <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> “could be taken as myself and that an analysis of it leads inevitably into an analysis of my own unconscious processes.”48 He had projected his material onto that of Miss Frank Miller, whom he had never met. Up to this point, Jung had been an active thinker and had been averse to fantasy: “as a form of thinking I held it to be altogether impure, a sort of incestuous intercourse, thoroughly immoral from an intellectual viewpoint.”49 He now turned to analyze his fantasies, carefully noting everything, and had to overcome considerable resistance in doing this: “Permitting fantasy in myself had the same effect as would be produced on a man if he came into his workshop and found all the tools flying about doing things independently of his will.”50 In studying his fantasies, Jung realized that he was studying the myth-creating function of the mind.51</p>
<p>Jung picked up the brown notebook, which he had set aside in 1902, and began writing in it.52 He noted his inner states in metaphors, such as being in a desert with an unbearably hot sun (that is, consciousness). In the 1925 seminar, he recalled that it occurred to him that he could write down his reflections in a sequence. He was “writing autobiographical material, but not as an autobiography.”53 From the time of the Platonic dialogues onward, the dialogical form has been a prominent genre in Western philosophy. In 387 CE, St. Augustine wrote his <em>Soliloquies,</em> which presented an extended dialogue between himself and “Reason,” who instructs him. They commenced with the following lines:</p>
<p>When I had been pondering many different things to myself for a long time, and had for many days been seeking my own self and what my own good was, and what evil was to be avoided, there suddenly spoke to me—what was it? I myself or someone else, inside or outside me? (this is the very thing I would love to know but don’t).54</p>
<p>While Jung was writing in <em>Black Book</em> 2,</p>
<p>I said to myself, “What is this I am doing, it certainly is not science, what is it?” Then a voice said to me, “That is art.” This made the strangest sort of impression upon me, because it was not in any sense my impression that what I was writing was art. Then I came to this, “Perhaps my unconscious is forming a personality that is not I, but which is insisting on coming through to expression.” I don’t know why exactly, but I knew to a certainty that the voice that had said my writing was art had come from a woman . . . Well I said very emphatically to this voice that what I was doing was not art, and I felt a great resistance grow up within me. No voice came through, however, and I kept on writing. This time I caught her and said, “No it is not,” and I felt as though an argument would ensue.55</p>
<p>He thought that this voice was “the soul in the primitive sense,” which he called the anima (the Latin word for soul).56 He stated that “In putting down all this material for analysis, I was in effect writing letters to my anima, that is part of myself with a different viewpoint from my own. I got remarks of a new character—I was in analysis with a ghost and a woman.”57 In retrospect, he recalled that this was the voice of a Dutch patient whom he knew from 1912 to 1918, who had persuaded a psychiatrist colleague that he was a misunderstood artist. The woman had thought that the unconscious was art, but Jung had maintained that it was nature.58 I have previously argued that the woman in question—the only Dutch woman in Jung’s circle at this time—was Maria Moltzer, and that the psychiatrist in question was Jung’s friend and colleague Franz Riklin, who increasingly forsook analysis for painting. In 1913, he became a student of Augusto Giacometti’s, the uncle of Alberto Giacometti, and an important early abstract painter in his own right.59</p>
<p>The November entries in <em>Black Book 2</em> depict Jung’s sense of his return to his soul. He recounted the dreams that led him to opt for his scientific career, and the recent dreams that had brought him back to his soul. As he recalled in 1925, this first period of writing came to an end in November: “Not knowing what would come next, I thought perhaps more introspection was needed . . . I devised such a boring method by fantasizing that I was digging a hole, and by accepting this fantasy as perfectly real.”60 The first such experiment took place on December 12, 1913.61</p>
<p>As indicated, Jung had had extensive experience studying mediums in trance states, during which they were encouraged to produce waking fantasies and visual hallucinations, and had conducted experiments with automatic writing. Practices of visualization had also been used in various religious traditions. For example, in the fifth of the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, individuals are instructed on how to “see with the eyes of the imagination the length, breadth and depth of hell,” and to experience this with full sensory immediacy.62 Swedenborg also engaged in “spirit writing.” In his spiritual diary, one entry reads:</p>
<p>26 JAN. 1748.—Spirits, if permitted, could possess those who speak with them so utterly, that they would be as though they were entirely in the world; and indeed, in a manner so manifest, that they could communicate their thoughts through their medium, and even by letters; for they have sometimes, and indeed often, directed my hand when writing, as though it were quite their own; so that they thought it was not I, but themselves writing.63</p>
<p>From 1909 onward in Vienna, the psychoanalyst Herbert Silberer conducted experiments on himself in hypnagogic states. Silberer attempted to allow images to appear. These images, he maintained, presented symbolic depictions of his previous train of thought. Silberer corresponded with Jung and sent him offprints of his articles.64</p>
<p>In 1912, Ludwig Staudenmaier (1865–1933), a professor of experimental chemistry, published a work entitled <em>Magic as an Experimental Science</em>. Staudenmaier had embarked on self-experimentations in 1901, commencing with automatic writing. A series of characters appeared, and he found that he no longer needed to write to conduct dialogues with them.65 He also induced acoustic and visual hallucinations. The aim of his enterprise was to use his self-experimentation to provide a scientific explanation of magic. He argued that the key to understanding magic lay in the concepts of hallucinations and the “under consciousness” (<em>Unterbewußtsein</em>), and gave particular importance to the role of personifications.66 Thus we see that Jung’s procedure closely resembled a number of historical and contemporary practices with which he was familiar.</p>
<p>From December 1913 onward, he carried on in the same procedure: deliberately evoking a fantasy in a waking state, and then entering into it as into a drama. These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form. In reading his fantasies, the impact of Jung’s mythological studies is clear. Some of the figures and conceptions derive directly from his readings, and the form and style bear witness to his fascination with the world of myth and epic. In the <em>Black Books</em>, Jung wrote down his fantasies in dated entries, together with reflections on his state of mind and his difficulties in comprehending the fantasies. The <em>Black Books</em> are not diaries of events, and very few dreams are noted in them. Rather, they are the records of an experiment. In December 1913, he referred to the first of the black books as the “book of my most difficult experiment.”67</p>
<p>In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does when taking mescalin.68</p>
<p>In an entry in his dream book on April 17, 1917, Jung noted: “since then, frequent exercises in the emptying of consciousness.”69 His procedure was clearly intentional—while its aim was to allow psychic contents to appear spontaneously. He recalled that beneath the threshold of consciousness, everything was animated. At times, it was as if he heard something. At other times, he realized that he was whispering to himself.70</p>
<p>From November 1913 to the following July, he remained uncertain of the meaning and significance of his undertaking, and concerning the meaning of his fantasies, which continued to develop. During this time, Philemon, who would prove to be an important figure in subsequent fantasies, appeared in a dream. Jung recounted:</p>
<p>There was a blue sky, like the sea, covered not by clouds but by flat brown clods of earth. It looked as if the clods were breaking apart and the blue water of the sea were becoming visible between them. But the water was the blue sky. Suddenly there appeared from the right a winged being sailing across the sky. I saw that it was an old man with the horns of a bull. He held a bunch of four keys, one of which he clutched as if he were about to open a lock. He had the wings of the kingfisher with its characteristic colors. Since I did not understand this dream image, I painted it in order to impress it upon my memory.71</p>
<p>While he was painting this image, he found a dead kingfisher (which is very rarely found in the vicinity of Zürich) in his garden by the lake shore.72</p>
<p>The date of this dream is not clear. The figure of Philemon first appears in the <em>Black Books</em> on January 27, 1914, but without kingfisher wings. To Jung, Philemon represented superior insight, and was like a guru to him. He would converse with him in the garden. He recalled that Philemon evolved out of the figure of Elijah, who had previously appeared in his fantasies:</p>
<p>Philemon was a pagan and brought with him an Egypto-Hellenic atmosphere with a Gnostic coloration . . . It was he who taught me psychic objectivity, the reality of the psyche. Through the conversations with Philemon, the distinction was clarified between myself and the object of my thought . . . Psychologically, Philemon represented superior insight.73</p>
<p>On April 20, Jung resigned as president of the International Psychoanalytical Association. On April 30, he resigned as a lecturer in the medical faculty of the University of Zürich. He recalled that he felt that he was in an exposed position at the university and felt that he had to find a new orientation, as it would otherwise be unfair to teach students.74 In June and July, he had a thrice-repeated dream of being in a foreign land and having to return home quickly by ship, followed by the descent of an icy cold.75</p>
<p>On July 10, the Zürich Psychoanalytical Society voted by 15 to 1 to leave the International Psychoanalytic Association. In the minutes, the reason given for the secession was that Freud had established an orthodoxy that impeded free and independent research.76 The group was renamed the Association for Analytical Psychology. Jung was actively involved in this association, which met fortnightly. He also maintained a busy therapeutic practice. Between 1913 and 1914, he had between one and nine consultations per day, five days a week, with an average of between five and seven.77</p>
<p>The minutes of the Association for Analytical Psychology offer no indications of the process that Jung was going through. He does not refer to his fantasies, and continues to discuss theoretical issues in psychology. The same holds true in his surviving correspondences during this period.78 Each year, he continued his military service duties.79 Thus he maintained his professional activities and familial responsibilities during the day, and dedicated his evenings to his self-explorations.80 Indications are that this partitioning of activities continued during the next few years. Jung recalled that during this period his family and profession “always remained a joyful reality and a guarantee that I was normal and really existed.”81</p>
<p>The question of the different ways of interpreting such fantasies was the subject of a talk that he presented on July 24 before the Psycho-Medical Society in London, “On psychological understanding.” Here, he contrasted Freud’s analytic-reductive method, based on causality, with the constructive method of the Zürich school. The shortcoming of the former was that through tracing things back to antecedent elements, it dealt with only half of the picture, and failed to grasp the living meaning of phenomena. Someone who attempted to understand Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> in such a manner would be like someone who tried to understand a Gothic cathedral under its mineralogical aspect.82 The living meaning “only lives when we experience it in and through ourselves.”83 Inasmuch as life was essentially new, it could not be understood merely retrospectively. Hence the constructive standpoint asked, “how, out of this present psyche, a bridge can be built into its own future.”84 This paper implicitly presents Jung’s rationale for not embarking on a causal and retrospective analysis of his fantasies, and serves as a caution to others who may be tempted to do so. Presented as a critique and reformulation of psychoanalysis, Jung’s new mode of interpretation links back to the symbolic method of Swedenborg’s spiritual hermeneutics.</p>
<p>On July 28, Jung gave a talk on “The importance of the unconscious in psychopathology” at a meeting of the British Medical Association in Aberdeen.85 He argued that in cases of neurosis and psychosis, the unconscious attempted to compensate the one-sided conscious attitude. The unbalanced individual defends himself against this, and the opposites become more polarized. The corrective impulses that present themselves in the language of the unconscious should be the beginning of a healing process, but the form in which they break through makes them unacceptable to consciousness.</p>
<p>A month earlier, on June 28, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, was assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a nineteen-year-old Serb student. On August 1, war broke out. In 1925 Jung recalled, “I had the feeling that I was an over-compensated psychosis, and from this feeling I was not released till August 1st 1914.”86 Years later, he said to Mircea Eliade:</p>
<p>As a psychiatrist I became worried, wondering if I was not on the way to “doing a schizophrenia,” as we said in the language of those days . . . I was just preparing a lecture on schizophrenia to be delivered at a congress in Aberdeen, and I kept saying to myself: “I’ll be speaking of myself! Very likely I’ll go mad after reading out this paper.” The congress was to take place in July 1914—exactly the same period when I saw myself in my three dreams voyaging on the Southern seas. On July 31st, immediately after my lecture, I learned from the newspapers that war had broken out. Finally I understood. And when I disembarked in Holland on the next day, nobody was happier than I. Now I was sure that no schizophrenia was threatening me. I understood that my dreams and my visions came to me from the subsoil of the collective unconscious. What remained for me to do now was to deepen and validate this discovery. And this is what I have been trying to do for forty years.87</p>
<p>At this moment, Jung considered that his fantasy had depicted not what would happen to <em>him</em>, but to Europe. In other words, that it was a precognition of a collective event, what he would later call a “big” dream.88 After this realization, he attempted to see whether and to what extent this was true of the other fantasies that he experienced, and to understand the meaning of this correspondence between private fantasies and public events. This effort makes up much of the subject matter of <em>Liber Novus</em>. In <em>Scrutinies</em>, he wrote that the outbreak of the war had enabled him to understand much of what he had previously experienced, and had given him the courage to write the earlier part of <em>Liber Novus</em>.89 Thus he took the outbreak of the war as showing him that his <em>fear</em> of going mad was misplaced. It is no exaggeration to say that had war not been declared, <em>Liber Novus</em> would in all likelihood not have been compiled. In 1955/56, while discussing active imagination, Jung commented that “the reason why the involvement looks very much like a psychosis is that the patient is integrating the same fantasy-material to which the insane person falls victim because he cannot integrate it but is swallowed up by it.”90</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are around twelve separate fantasies that Jung may have regarded as precognitive:</p>
<p>1–2. OCTOBER, 1913<br>
Repeated vision of flood and death of thousands, and the voice that said that this will become real.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>AUTUMN 1913<br>
Vision of the sea of blood covering the northern lands.<br>
4–5. DECEMBER 12, 15, 1913<br>
Image of a dead hero and the slaying of Siegfried in a dream.</li>
<li>DECEMBER 25, 1913<br>
Image of the foot of a giant stepping on a city, and images of murder and bloody cruelty.</li>
<li>JANUARY 2, 1914<br>
Image of a sea of blood and a procession of dead multitudes.</li>
<li>JANUARY 22, 1914<br>
His soul comes up from the depths and asks him if he will accept war and destruction. She shows him images of destruction, military weapons, human remains, sunken ships, destroyed states, etc.</li>
<li>MAY 21, 1914<br>
A voice says that the sacrificed fall left and right.<br>
10–12. JUNE–JULY 1914<br>
Thrice-repeated dream of being in a foreign land and having to return quickly by ship, and the descent of the icy cold.91</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Liber Novus</em></p>
<p>Jung now commenced writing the draft of <em>Liber Novus</em>. He faithfully transcribed most of the fantasies from the <em>Black Books</em>, and to each of these added a section explaining the significance of each episode, combined with a lyrical elaboration. Word-by-word comparison indicates that the fantasies were faithfully reproduced, with only minor editing and division into chapters. Thus the sequence of the fantasies in <em>Liber Novus</em> nearly always exactly corresponds to the <em>Black Books</em>. When it is indicated that a particular fantasy happened “on the next night,” etc., this is always accurate, and not a stylistic device. The language and content of the material were not altered. Jung maintained a “fidelity to the event,” and what he was writing was not to be mistaken for a fiction. The draft begins with the address to “My friends,” and this phrase occurs frequently. The main difference between the <em>Black Books</em> and <em>Liber Novus</em> is that the former were written for Jung’s personal use, and can be considered the records of an experiment, while the latter is addressed to a public and presented in a form to be read by others.</p>
<p>In November 1914, Jung closely studied Nietzsche’s <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, which he had first read in his youth. He later recalled, “then suddenly the spirit seized me and carried me to a desert country in which I read Zarathustra.”92 It strongly shaped the structure and style of <em>Liber Novus</em>. Like Nietzsche in <em>Zarathustra</em>, Jung divided the material into a series of books comprised of short chapters. But whereas Zarathustra proclaimed the death of God, <em>Liber Novus</em> depicts the rebirth of God in the soul. There are also indications that he read Dante’s <em>Commedia</em> at this time, which also informs the structure of the work.93 <em>Liber Novus</em> depicts Jung’s descent into Hell. But whereas Dante could utilize an established cosmology, <em>Liber Novus</em> is an attempt to shape an individual cosmology. The role of Philemon in Jung’s work has analogies to that of Zarathustra in Nietzsche’s work and Virgil in Dante’s.</p>
<p>In the <em>Draft</em>, about 50 percent of the material is drawn directly from the <em>Black Books</em>. There are about thirty-five new sections of commentary. In these sections, he attempted to derive general psychological principles from the fantasies, and to understand to what extent the events portrayed in the fantasies presented, in a symbolic form, developments that were to occur in the world. In 1913, Jung had introduced a distinction between interpretation on the objective level in which dream objects were treated as representations of real objects, and interpretation on the subjective level in which every element concerns the dreamers themselves.94 As well as interpreting his fantasies on the subjective level, one could characterize his procedure here as an attempt to interpret his fantasies on the “collective” level. He does not try to interpret his fantasies reductively, but sees them as depicting the functioning of general psychological principles in him (such as the relation of introversion to extraversion, thinking and pleasure, etc.), and as depicting literal or symbolic events that are going to happen. Thus the second layer of the <em>Draft</em> represents the first major and extended attempt to develop and apply his new constructive method. The second layer is itself a hermeneutic experiment. In a critical sense, <em>Liber Novus</em> does not require supplemental interpretation, for it contains its own interpretation.</p>
<p>In writing the <em>Draft</em>, Jung did not add scholarly references, though unreferenced citations and allusions to works of philosophy, religion, and literature abound. He had self-consciously chosen to leave scholarship to one side. Yet the fantasies and the reflections on them in <em>Liber Novus</em> are those of a scholar and, indeed, much of the self-experimentation and the composition of <em>Liber Novus</em> took place in his library. It is quite possible that he might have added references if he had decided to publish the work.</p>
<p>After completing the handwritten <em>Draft</em>, Jung had it typed, and edited it. On one manuscript, he made alterations by hand (I refer to this manuscript as the <em>Corrected Draft</em>). Judging from the annotations, it appears that he gave it to someone (the handwriting is not that of Emma Jung, Toni Wolff, or Maria Moltzer) to read, who then commented on Jung’s editing, indicating that some sections which he had intended to cut should be retained.95 The first section of the work—untitled, but effectively <em>Liber Primus</em>—was composed on parchment. Jung then commissioned a large folio volume of over 600 pages, bound in red leather, from the bookbinders, Emil Stierli. The spine bears the title, <em>Liber Novus</em>. He then inserted the parchment pages into the folio volume, which continues with <em>Liber Secundus</em>. The work is organized like a medieval illuminated manuscript, with calligraphic writing, headed by a table of abbreviations. Jung titled the first book “The Way of What Is to Come,” and placed beneath this some citations from the book of Isaiah and from the gospel according to John. Thus it was presented as a prophetic work.</p>
<p>In the <em>Draft</em>, Jung had divided the material into chapters. In the course of the transcription into the red leather folio, he altered some of the titles to the chapters, added others, and edited the material once again. The cuts and alterations were predominantly to the second layer of interpretation and elaboration, and not to the fantasy material itself, and mainly consisted in shortening the text. It is this second layer that Jung continually reworked. In the transcription of the text in this edition, this second layer has been indicated, so that the chronology and composition are visible. As Jung’s comments in the second layer sometimes implicitly refer forward to fantasies that are found later in the text, it is also helpful to read the fantasies straight through in chronological sequence, followed by a continuous reading of the second layer.</p>
<p>Jung then illustrated the text with some paintings, historiated initials, ornamental borders, and margins. Initially, the paintings refer directly to the text. At a later point, the paintings become more symbolic. They are active imaginations in their own right. The combination of text and image recalls the illuminated works of William Blake, whose work Jung had some familiarity with.96</p>
<p>A preparatory draft of one of the images in <em>Liber Novus</em> has survived, which indicates that they were carefully composed, starting from pencil sketches that were then elaborated.97 The composition of the other images likely followed a similar procedure. From the paintings of Jung’s which have survived, it is striking that they make an abrupt leap from the representational landscapes of 1902/3 to the abstract and semifigurative from 1915 onward.</p>
<p>Art and the Zürich School</p>
<p>Jung’s library today contains few books on modern art, though some books were probably dispersed over the years. He possessed a catalogue of the graphic works of Odilon Redon, as well as a study of him.98 He likely encountered Redon’s work when he was in Paris. Strong echoes of the symbolist movement appear in the paintings in <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>In October of 1910, Jung went on a bicycle tour of northern Italy, together with his colleague Wolfgang Stockmayer.99 In April 1914, he visited Ravenna, and the frescos and mosaics there made a deep impression on him. These works seemed to have had an impact on his paintings: the use of strong colors, mosaic-like forms, and two-dimensional figures without the use of perspective.</p>
<p>In 1913 when he was in New York, he likely attended the Armory Show, which was the first major international exhibition of modern art in America (the show ran to March 15, and Jung left for New York on March 4). He referred to Marcel Duchamp’s painting <em>Nude Descending a Staircase</em> in his 1925 seminar, which had caused a furor there.100 Here, he also referred to having studied the course of Picasso’s paintings. Given the lack of evidence of extended study, Jung’s knowledge of modern art probably derived more immediately from direct acquaintance.</p>
<p>During the First World War, there were contacts between the members of the Zürich school and artists. Both were part of avant-garde movements and intersecting social circles.101 In 1913, Erika Schlegel came to Jung for analysis. She and her husband, Eugen Schlegel, had been friendly with Toni Wolff. Erika Schlegel was Sophie Taeuber’s sister, and became the librarian of the Psychological Club. Members of the Psychological Club were invited to some of the Dada events. At the celebration of the opening of the Gallery Dada on March 29, 1917, Hugo Ball notes members of the Club in the audience.102 The program that evening included abstract dances by Sophie Taeuber and poems by Hugo Ball, Hans Arp, and Tristan Tzara. Sophie Taeuber, who had studied with Laban, arranged a dance class for members of the Club together with Arp. A masked ball was also held and she designed the costumes.103 In 1918, she presented a marionette play, <em>King Deer</em>, in Zürich. It was set in the woods by the Burghölzli. Freud Analytikus, opposed by Dr. Oedipus Complex, is transformed into a parrot by the Ur-Libido, parodically taking up themes from Jung’s <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> and his conflict with Freud.104 However, relations between Jung’s circle and some of the Dadaists became more strained. In May 1917, Emmy Hennings wrote to Hugo Ball that the “psycho-Club” had now gone away.105 In 1918, Jung criticized the Dada movement in a Swiss review, which did not escape the attention of the Dadaists.106 The critical element that separated Jung’s pictorial work from that of the Dadaists was his overriding emphasis on meaning and signification.</p>
<p>Jung’s self-explorations and creative experiments did not occur in a vacuum. During this period, there was great interest in art and painting within his circle. Alphonse Maeder wrote a monograph on Ferdinand Hodler107 and had a friendly correspondence with him.108 Around 1916, Maeder had a series of visions or waking fantasies, which he published pseudonymously. When he told Jung of these events, Jung replied, “What, you too?”109 Hans Schmid also wrote and painted his fantasies in something akin to <em>Liber Novus</em>. Moltzer was keen to increase the artistic activities of the Zürich school. She felt that more artists were needed in their circle and considered Riklin as a model.110 J. B. Lang, who was analyzed by Riklin, began to paint symbolic paintings. Moltzer had a book that she called her Bible, in which she put pictures with writings. She recommended that her patient Fanny Bowditch Katz do the same thing.111</p>
<p>In 1919, Riklin exhibited some of his paintings as part of the “New Life” at the Kunsthaus in Zürich, described as a group of Swiss Expressionists, alongside Hans Arp, Sophie Taeuber, Francis Picabia, and Augusto Giacometti.112 With his personal connections, Jung could easily have exhibited some of his works in such a setting, had he so liked. Thus his refusal to consider his works as art occurs in a context where there were quite real possibilities for him to have taken this route.</p>
<p>On some occasions, Jung discussed art with Erika Schlegel. She noted the following conversation:</p>
<p>I wore my pearl medallion (the pearl embroidery that Sophie had made for me) at Jung’s yesterday. He liked it very much, and it prompted him to talk animatedly about art—for almost an hour. He discussed Riklin, one of Augusto Giacometti’s students, and observed that while his smaller works had a certain aesthetic value, his larger ones simply dissolved. Indeed, he vanished wholly in his art, rendering him utterly intangible. His work was like a wall over which water rippled. He could therefore not analyze, as this required one to be pointed and sharp-edged, like a knife. He had fallen into art in a manner of speaking. But art and science were no more than the servants of the creative spirit, which is what must be served.</p>
<p>As regards my own work, it was also a matter of making out whether it was really art. Fairy tales and pictures had a religious meaning at bottom. I, too, know that somehow and sometime it must reach people.113</p>
<p>For Jung, Franz Riklin appears to have been something like a doppelganger, whose fate he was keen to avoid. This statement also indicates Jung’s relativization of the status of art and science to which he had come through his self-experimentation.</p>
<p>Thus, the making of <em>Liber Novus</em> was by no means a peculiar and idiosyncratic activity, nor the product of a psychosis. Rather, it indicates the close intersections between psychological and artistic experimentation with which many individuals were engaged at this time.</p>
<p>The Collective Experiment</p>
<p>In 1915, Jung held a lengthy correspondence with his colleague Hans Schmid on the question of the understanding of psychological types. This correspondence gives no direct signs of Jung’s self-experimentation, and indicates that theories he developed during this period did not stem solely from his active imaginations, but also in part consisted of conventional psychological theorizing.114 On March 5, 1915, Jung wrote to Smith Ely Jeliffe:</p>
<p>I am still with the army in a little town where I have plenty of practical work and horseback riding . . . Until I had to join the army I lived quietly and devoted my time to my patients and to my work. I was especially working about the two types of psychology and about the synthesis of unconscious tendencies.115</p>
<p>During his self-explorations, he experienced states of turmoil. He recalled that he experienced great fear, and sometimes had to hold the table to keep himself together,116 and “I was frequently so wrought up that I had to eliminate the emotions through yoga practices. But since it was my purpose to learn what was going on within myself, I would do them only until I had calmed myself and could take up again the work with the unconscious.”117</p>
<p>He recalled that Toni Wolff had become drawn into the process in which he was involved, and was experiencing a similar stream of images. Jung found that he could discuss his experiences with her, but she was disorientated and in the same mess.118 Likewise, his wife was unable to help him in this regard. Consequently, he noted, “that I was able to endure at all was a case of brute force.”119</p>
<p>The Psychological Club had been founded at the beginning of 1916, through a gift of 360,000 Swiss francs from Edith Rockefeller McCormick, who had come to Zürich to be analyzed by Jung in 1913. At its inception, it had approximately sixty members. For Jung, the aim of the Club was to study the relation of individuals to the group, and to provide a naturalistic setting for psychological observation to overcome the limitations of one-to-one analysis, as well as to provide a venue where patients could learn to adapt to social situations. At the same time, a professional body of analysts continued to meet together as the Association for Analytical Psychology.120 Jung participated fully in both of these organizations.</p>
<p>Jung’s self-experimentation also heralded a change in his analytic work. He encouraged his patients to embark upon similar processes of self-experimentation. Patients were instructed on how to conduct active imagination, to hold inner dialogues, and to paint their fantasies. He took his own experiences as paradigmatic. In the 1925 seminar, he noted: “I drew all my empirical material from my patients, but the solution of the problem I drew from the inside, from my observations of the unconscious processes.”121</p>
<p>Tina Keller, who was in analysis with Jung from 1912, recalls that Jung “often spoke of himself and his own experiences” :</p>
<p>In those early days, when one arrived for the analytic hour, the so-called “red book” often stood open on an easel. In it Dr. Jung had been painting or had just finished a picture. Sometimes he would show me what he had done and comment upon it. The careful and precise work he put into these pictures and into the illuminated text that accompanied them were a testimony to the importance of this undertaking. The master thus demonstrated to the student that psychic development is worth time and effort.122</p>
<p>In her analyses with Jung and Toni Wolff, Keller conducted active imaginations and also painted. Far from being a solitary endeavor, Jung’s confrontation with the unconscious was a collective one, in which he took his patients along with him. Those around Jung formed an avant-garde group engaged in a social experiment that they hoped would transform their lives and the lives of those around them.</p>
<p>The Return of the Dead</p>
<p>Amid the unprecedented carnage of the war, the theme of the return of the dead was widespread, such as in Abel Gance’s film <em>J’accuse</em>.123 The death toll also led to a revival of interest in spiritualism. After nearly a year, Jung began to write again in the <em>Black Books</em> in 1915, with a further series of fantasies. He had already completed the handwritten draft of <em>Liber Primus</em> and <em>Liber Secundus</em>.124 At the beginning of 1916, Jung experienced a striking series of parapsychological events in his house. In 1923, he narrated this event to Cary de Angulo (later Baynes). She recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>One night your boy began to rave in his sleep and throw himself about saying he couldn’t wake up. Finally your wife had to call you to get him quiet &amp; this you could only do by cold cloths on him—finally he settled down and went on sleeping. Next morning he woke up remembering nothing, but seemed utterly exhausted, so you told him not to go to school, he didn’t ask why but seemed to take it for granted. But quite unexpectedly he asked for paper and colored pencils and set to work to make the following picture—a man was angling for fishes with hook and line in the middle of the picture. On the left was the Devil saying something to the man, and your son wrote down what he said. It was that he had come for the fisherman because he was catching his fishes, but on the right was an angel who said, “No you can’t take this man, he is taking only bad fishes and none of the good ones.” Then after your son had made that picture he was quite content. The same night, two of your daughters thought that they had seen spooks in their rooms. The next day you wrote out the “Sermons to the Dead,” and you knew after that nothing more would disturb your family, and nothing did. Of course I knew you were the fisherman in your son’s picture, and you told me so, but the boy didn’t know it.125</p>
<p>In <em>Memories</em>, Jung recounted what followed:</p>
<p>Around five o’clock in the afternoon on Sunday the front doorbell began ringing frantically . . . Everyone immediately looked to see who was there, but there was no one in sight. I was sitting near the doorbell, and not heard it but saw it moving. We all simply stared at one another. The atmosphere was thick, believe me! Then I knew something had to happen. The whole house was as if there was a crowd present, crammed full of spirits. They were packed deep right up to the door and the air was so thick it was scarcely possible to breathe. As for myself, I was all aquiver with the question: “For God’s sake, what in the world is this?” Then they cried out in chorus, “We have come back from Jerusalem where we found not what we sought.” That is the beginning of the <em>Septem Sermones</em>.</p>
<p>Then it began to flow out of me, and in the course of three evenings the thing was written. As soon as I took up the pen, the whole ghastly assemblage evaporated. The room quieted and the atmosphere cleared. The haunting was over.126</p>
<p>The dead had appeared in a fantasy on January 17, 1914, and had said that they were about to go to Jerusalem to pray at the holiest graves.127 Their trip had evidently not been successful. The <em>Septem Sermones</em> <em>ad Mortuos</em> is a culmination of the fantasies of this period. It is a psychological cosmology cast in the form of a gnostic creation myth. In Jung’s fantasies, a new God had been born in his soul, the God who is the son of the frogs, Abraxas. Jung understood this symbolically. He saw this figure as representing the uniting of the Christian God with Satan, and hence as depicting a transformation of the Western God-image. Not until 1952 in <em>Answer to Job</em> did Jung elaborate on this theme in public.</p>
<p>Jung had studied the literature on Gnosticism in the course of his preparatory reading for <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>. In January and October 1915, while on military service, he studied the works of the Gnostics. After writing the <em>Septem Sermones</em> in the <em>Black Books</em>, Jung recopied it in a calligraphic script into a separate book, slightly rearranging the sequence. He added the following inscription under the title: “The seven instructions of the dead. Written by Basilides in Alexandria, the city where the East touches the West.”128 He then had this privately printed, adding to the inscription: “Translated from the Greek original into German.” This legend indicates the stylistic effects on Jung of late-nineteenth-century classical scholarship. He recalled that he wrote it on the occasion of the founding of the Psychological Club, and regarded it as a gift to Edith Rockefeller McCormick for founding the Club.129 He gave copies to friends and confidants. Presenting a copy to Alphonse Maeder, he wrote:</p>
<p>I could not presume to put my name to it, but chose instead the name of one of those great minds of the early Christian era which Christianity obliterated. It fell quite unexpectedly into my lap like a ripe fruit at a time of great stress and has kindled a light of hope and comfort for me in my bad hours.130</p>
<p>On January 16, 1916, Jung drew a mandala in the <em>Black Books</em> (see Appendix A). This was the first sketch of the “Systema Munditotius.” He then proceeded to paint this. On the back of it, he wrote in English: “This is the first mandala I constructed in the year 1916, wholly unconscious of what it meant.” The fantasies in the <em>Black Books</em> continued. The Systema Munditotius is a pictorial cosmology of the <em>Sermones</em>.</p>
<p>Between June 11 and October 2, 1917, Jung was on military service in Chateau d’Oex, as commander of the English prisoners of war. Around August, he wrote to Smith Ely Jeliffe that his military service had taken him completely away from his work and that, on his return, he hoped to finish a long paper about the types. He concluded the letter by writing: “With us everything is unchanged and quiet. Everything else is swallowed by the war. The psychosis is still increasing, going on and on.”131</p>
<p>At this time, he felt that he was still in a state of chaos and that it only began to clear toward the end of the war.132 From the beginning of August to the end of September, he drew a series of twenty-seven mandalas in pencil in his army notebook, which he preserved.133 At first, he did not understand these mandalas, but felt that they were very significant. From August 20, he drew a mandala on most days. This gave him the feeling that he had taken a photograph of each day and he observed how these mandalas changed. He recalled that he received a letter from “this Dutch woman that got on my nerves terribly.”134 In this letter, this woman, that is, Moltzer, argued that “the fantasies stemming from the unconscious possessed artistic worth and should be considered as art.”135 Jung found this troubling because it was not stupid, and, moreover, modern painters were attempting to make art out of the unconscious. This awoke a doubt in him whether his fantasies were really spontaneous and natural. On the next day, he drew a mandala, and a piece of it was broken off, leaving the symmetry:</p>
<p>Only now did I gradually come to what the mandala really is: “Formation, transformation, the eternal mind’s eternal recreation.” And that is the self, the wholeness of the personality, which, when everything is well, is harmonious, but which can bear no self deception. My mandala images were cryptograms on the state of my self, which were delivered to me each day.136</p>
<p>The mandala in question appears to be the mandala of August 6, 1917.137 The second line is from Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>. Mephistopheles is addressing Faust, giving him directions to the realm of the Mothers:</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES<br>
A glowing tripod will finally show you<br>
that you are in the deepest, most deepest ground.<br>
By its light you will see the Mothers:<br>
the one sits, others stand and walk,<br>
as it may chance. Formation, transformation<br>
the eternal mind’s eternal recreation.<br>
Covered in images of all creatures,<br>
they do not see you, since they only see shades.<br>
Then hold your heart, since the danger is great,<br>
and go straight to that tripod,<br>
touch it with the key!138</p>
<p>The letter in question has not come to light. However, in a subsequent unpublished letter from November 21, 1918, while at Chateau d’Oex, Jung wrote that “M. Moltzer has again disturbed me with letters.”139 He reproduced the mandalas in <em>Liber Novus</em>. He noted that it was during this period that a living idea of the self first came to him: “The self, I thought, was like the monad which I am, and which is my world. The mandala represents this monad, and corresponds to the microcosmic nature of the soul.”140 At this point, he did not know where this process was leading, but he began to grasp that the mandala represented the goal of the process: “Only when I began to paint the mandalas did I see that all the paths I took, all the steps I made, all led back to the one point, that is, to the center. The mandala became the expression of all paths.”141 In the 1920s, Jung’s understanding of the significance of the mandala deepened.</p>
<p>The <em>Draft</em> had contained fantasies from October 1913 to February 1914. In the winter of 1917, Jung wrote a fresh manuscript called <em>Scrutinies</em>, which began where he had left off. In this, he transcribed fantasies from April 1913 until June 1916. As in the first two books of <em>Liber Novus</em>, Jung interspersed the fantasies with interpretive commentaries.142 He included the <em>Sermones</em> in this material, and now added Philemon’s commentaries on each sermon. In these, Philemon stressed the compensatory nature of his teaching: he deliberately stressed precisely those conceptions that the dead lacked. <em>Scrutinies</em> effectively forms <em>Liber Tertius of Liber Novus</em>. The complete sequence of the text would thus be:</p>
<p><em>Liber Primus</em>: The Way of What Is to Come<br>
<em>Liber Secundus</em>: The Images of the Erring<br>
<em>Liber Tertius</em>: Scrutinies</p>
<p>During this period, Jung continued transcribing the <em>Draft</em> into the calligraphic volume and adding paintings. The fantasies in the <em>Black Books</em> became more intermittent. He portrayed his realization of the significance of the self, which took place in the autumn of 1917, in <em>Scrutinies</em>.143 This contains Jung’s vision of the reborn God, culminating in the portrayal of Abraxas. He realized that much of what was given to him in the earlier part of the book (that is, <em>Liber Primus</em> and <em>Liber Secundus</em>) was actually given to him by Philemon.144 He realized that there was a prophetic wise old man in him, to whom he was not identical. This represented a critical disidentification. On January 17, 1918, Jung wrote to J. B. Lang:</p>
<p>The work on the unconscious has to happen first and foremost for us ourselves. Our patients profit from it indirectly. The danger consists in the prophet’s delusion which often is the result of dealing with the unconscious. It is the devil who says: Disdain all reason and science, mankind’s highest powers. That is never appropriate even though we are forced to acknowledge [the existence of] the irrational.145</p>
<p>Jung’s critical task in “working over” his fantasies was to differentiate the voices and characters. For example, in the <em>Black Books</em>, it is Jung’s “1” who speaks the <em>Sermones</em> to the dead. In <em>Scrutinies</em>, it is not Jung’s “1” but Philemon who speaks them. In the <em>Black Books</em>, the main figure with whom Jung has dialogues is his soul. In some sections of <em>Liber Novus</em>, this is changed to the serpent and the bird. In one conversation in January 1916, his soul explained to him that when the Above and Below are not united, she falls into three parts—a serpent, the human soul, and the bird or heavenly soul, which visits the Gods. Thus Jung’s revision here can be seen to reflect his understanding of the tripartite nature of his soul.146</p>
<p>During this period, Jung continued to work over his material, and there is some indication that he discussed it with his colleagues. In March 1918 he wrote to J. B. Lang, who had sent him some of his own fantasies:</p>
<p>I would not want to say anything more than telling you to continue with this approach because, as you have observed correctly yourself, it is very important that we experience the contents of the unconscious before we form any opinions about it. I very much agree with you that we have to grapple with the knowledge content of gnosis and neo-Platonism, since these are the systems that contain the materials which are suited to form the basis of a theory of the unconscious spirit. I have already been working on this myself for a long time, and also have had ample opportunity to compare my experiences at least partially with those of others. That’s why I was very pleased to hear pretty much the same views from you. I am glad that you have discovered all on your own this area of work which is ready to be tackled. Up to now, I lacked workers. I am happy that you want to join forces with me. I consider it very important that you extricate your own material uninfluenced from the unconscious, as carefully as possible. My material is very voluminous, very complicated, and in part very graphic, up to almost completely worked through clarifications. But what I completely lack is comparative modern material. Zarathustra is too strongly consciously formed. Meyrink retouches aesthetically; furthermore, I feel he is lacking in religious sincerity.147</p>
<p>The Content</p>
<p><em>Liber Novus</em> thus presents a series of active imaginations together with Jung’s attempt to understand their significance. This work of understanding encompasses a number of interlinked threads: an attempt to understand himself and to integrate and develop the various components of his personality; an attempt to understand the structure of the human personality in general; an attempt to understand the relation of the individual to present-day society and to the community of the dead; an attempt to understand the psychological and historical effects of Christianity; and an attempt to grasp the future religious development of the West. Jung discusses many other themes in the work, including the nature of self-knowledge; the nature of the soul; the relations of thinking and feeling and the psychological types; the relation of inner and outer masculinity and femininity; the uniting of opposites; solitude; the value of scholarship and learning; the status of science; the significance of symbols and how they are to be understood; the meaning of the war; madness, divine madness, and psychiatry; how the Imitation of Christ is to be understood today; the death of God; the historical significance of Nietzsche; and the relation of magic and reason.</p>
<p>The overall theme of the book is how Jung regains his soul and overcomes the contemporary malaise of spiritual alienation. This is ultimately achieved through enabling the rebirth of a new image of God in his soul and developing a new worldview in the form of a psychological and theological cosmology. <em>Liber Novus</em> presents the prototype of Jung’s conception of the individuation process, which he held to be the universal form of individual psychological development. <em>Liber Novus</em> itself can be understood on one hand as depicting Jung’s individuation process, and on the other hand as his elaboration of this concept as a general psychological schema. At the beginning of the book, Jung refinds his soul and then embarks on a sequence of fantasy adventures, which form a consecutive narrative. He realized that until then, he had served the spirit of the time, characterized by use and value. In addition to this, there existed a spirit of the depths, which led to the things of the soul. In terms of Jung’s later biographical memoir, the spirit of the times corresponds to personality NO. 1, and the spirit of the depths corresponds to personality NO. 2. Thus this period could be seen as a return to the values of personality NO. 2. The chapters follow a particular format: they begin with the exposition of dramatic visual fantasies. In them Jung encounters a series of figures in various settings and enters into conversation with them. He is confronted with unexpected happenings and shocking statements. He then attempts to understand what had transpired, and to formulate the significance of these events and statements into general psychological conceptions and maxims. Jung held that the significance of these fantasies was due to the fact that they stemmed from the mythopoeic imagination which was missing in the present rational age. The task of individuation lay in establishing a dialogue with the fantasy figures—or contents of the collective unconscious—and integrating them into consciousness, hence recovering the value of the mythopoeic imagination which had been lost to the modern age, and thereby reconciling the spirit of the time with the spirit of the depth. This task was to form a leitmotif of his subsequent scholarly work.</p>
<p>“A New Spring of Life”</p>
<p>In 1916, Jung wrote several essays and a short book in which he began to attempt to translate some of themes of <em>Liber Novus</em> into contemporary psychological language, and to reflect on the significance and the generality of his activity. Significantly, in these works he presented the first outlines of the main components of his mature psychology. A full account of these papers is beyond the scope of this introduction. The following overview highlights elements that link most directly with <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>In his works between 1911 and 1914, he had principally been concerned with establishing a structural account of general human functioning and of psychopathology. In addition to his earlier theory of complexes, we see that he had already formulated conceptions of a phylogenetically acquired unconscious peopled by mythic images, of a nonsexual psychic energy, of the general types of introversion and extraversion, of the compensatory and prospective function of dreams, and of the synthetic and constructive approach to fantasies. While he continued to expand and develop these conceptions in detail, a new project emerges here: the attempt to provide a temporal account of higher development, which he termed the individuation process. This was a pivotal theoretical result of his self-experimentation. The full elaboration of the individuation process, and its historical and cross-cultural comparison, would come to occupy him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>In 1916, he presented a lecture to the association for analytical psychology entitled “The structure of the unconscious,” which was first published in a French translation in Flournoy’s <em>Archives de Psychologie</em>.148 Here, he differentiated two layers of the unconscious. The first, the personal unconscious, consisted in elements acquired during one’s lifetime, together with elements that could equally well be conscious.149 The second was the impersonal unconscious or collective psyche.150 While consciousness and the personal unconscious were developed and acquired in the course of one’s lifetime, the collective psyche was inherited.151 In this essay, Jung discussed the curious phenomena that resulted from assimilating the unconscious. He noted that when individuals annexed the contents of the collective psyche and regarded them as personal attributes, they experienced extreme states of superiority and inferiority. He borrowed the term “godlikeness” from Goethe and Alfred Adler to characterize this state, which arose from fusing the personal and collective psyche, and was one of the dangers of analysis.</p>
<p>Jung wrote that it was a difficult task to differentiate the personal and collective psyche. One of the factors one came up against was the persona—one’s “mask” or “role.” This represented the segment of the collective psyche that one mistakenly regarded as individual. When one analyzed this, the personality dissolved into the collective psyche, which resulted in the release of a stream of fantasies: “All the treasures of mythological thinking and feeling are unlocked.”152 The difference between this state and insanity lay in the fact that it was intentional.</p>
<p>Two possibilities arose: one could attempt to regressively restore persona and return to the prior state, but it was impossible to get rid of the unconscious. Alternatively, one could accept the condition of godlikeness. However, there was a third way: the hermeneutic treatment of creative fantasies. This resulted in a synthesis of the individual with the collective psyche, which revealed the individual lifeline. This was the process of individuation. In a subsequent undated revision of this paper, Jung introduced the notion of the anima, as a counterpart to that of the persona. He regarded both of these as “subject-imagoes.” Here, he defined the anima as “how the subject is seen by the collective unconscious.”153</p>
<p>The vivid description of the vicissitudes of the state of godlikeness mirror some of Jung’s affective states during his confrontation with the unconscious. The notion of the differentiation of the persona and its analysis corresponds to the opening section of <em>Liber Novus</em>, where Jung sets himself apart from his role and achievements and attempts to reconnect with his soul. The release of mythological fantasies is precisely what ensued in his case, and the hermeneutic treatment of creative fantasies was what he presented in layer two of <em>Liber Novus</em>. The differentiation of the personal and impersonal unconscious provided a theoretical understanding of Jung’s mythological fantasies: it suggests that he did not view them as stemming from his personal unconscious but from the inherited collective psyche. If so, his fantasies stemmed from a layer of the psyche that was a collective human inheritance, and were not simply idiosyncratic or arbitrary.</p>
<p>In October of the same year, Jung presented two talks to the Psychological Club. The first was titled “Adaptation.” This took two forms: adaptation to outer and inner conditions. The “inner” was understood to designate the unconscious. Adaptation to the “inner” led to the demand for individuation, which was contrary to adaptation to others. Answering this demand and the corresponding break with conformity led to a tragic guilt that required expiation and called for a new “collective function,” because the individual had to produce values that could serve as a substitute for his absence from society. These new values enabled one to make reparation to the collective. Individuation was for the few. Those who were insufficiently creative should rather reestablish collective conformity with a society. The individual had not only to create new values, but also socially recognizable ones, as society had a “<em>right to expect realizable values</em>.”154</p>
<p>Read in terms of Jung’s situation, this suggests that his break with social conformity to pursue his “individuation” had led him to the view that he had to produce socially realizable values as an expiation. This led to a dilemma: would the form in which Jung embodied these new values in <em>Liber Novus</em> be socially acceptable and recognizable? This commitment to the demands of society separated Jung from the anarchism of the Dadaists.</p>
<p>The second talk was on “Individuation and collectivity.” He argued that individuation and collectivity were a pair of opposites related by guilt. Society demanded imitation. Through the process of imitation, one could gain access to values that were one’s own. In analysis, “Through imitation the patient learns individuation, because it reactivates his own values.”155 It is possible to read this as a comment on the role of imitation in the analytic treatments of those of his patients whom Jung had now encouraged to embark on similar processes of development. The claim that this process evoked the patient’s preexisting values was a counter to the charge of suggestion.</p>
<p>In November, while on military service at Herisau, Jung wrote a paper on “The transcendent function,” which was published only in 1957. There, he depicted the method of eliciting and developing fantasies that he later termed active imagination, and explained its therapeutic rationale. This paper can be viewed as an interim progress report on Jung’s self-experimentation, and may profitably be considered as a preface to <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>Jung noted that the new attitude gained from analysis became obsolete. Unconscious materials were needed to supplement the conscious attitude, and to correct its one-sidedness. But because energy tension was low in sleep, dreams were inferior expressions of unconscious contents. Thus other sources had to be turned to, namely, spontaneous fantasies. A recently recovered dream book contains a series of dreams from 1917 to 1925.156 A close comparison of this book with the <em>Black Books</em> indicates that his active imaginations did not derive directly from his dreams, and that these two streams were generally independent.</p>
<p>Jung described his technique for inducing such spontaneous fantasies: “The training consists first of all in systematic exercises for eliminating critical attention, thus producing a vacuum in consciousness.”157 One commenced by concentrating on a particular mood, and attempting to become as conscious as possible of all fantasies and associations that came up in connection with it. The aim was to allow fantasy free play, without departing from the initial affect in a free associative process. This led to a concrete or symbolic expression of the mood, which had the result of bringing the affect nearer to consciousness, hence making it more understandable. Doing this could have a vitalizing effect. Individuals could draw, paint, or sculpt, depending on their propensities:</p>
<p>Visual types should concentrate on the expectation that an inner image will be produced. As a rule such a fantasy-image will actually appear—perhaps hypnagogically—and should be carefully noted down in writing. Audio-verbal types usually hear inner words, perhaps mere fragments or apparently meaningless sentences to begin with . . . Others at such times simply hear their “other” voice . . . Still rarer, but equally valuable, is automatic writing, direct or with the planchette.158</p>
<p>Once these fantasies had been produced and embodied, two approaches were possible: creative formulation and understanding. Each needed the other, and both were necessary to produce the transcendent function, which arose out of the union of conscious and unconscious contents.</p>
<p>For some people, Jung noted, it was simple to note the “other” voice in writing and to answer it from the standpoint of the I: “It is exactly as if a dialogue were taking place between two human beings . . . ”159 This dialogue led to the creation of the transcendent function, which resulted in a widening of consciousness. This depiction of inner dialogues and the means of evoking fantasies in a waking state represents Jung’s own undertaking in the <em>Black Books</em>. The interplay of creative formulation and understanding corresponds to Jung’s work in <em>Liber Novus</em>. Jung did not publish this paper. He later remarked that he never finished his work on the transcendent function because he did it only halfheartedly.160</p>
<p>In 1917, Jung published a short book with a long title: <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes: An Overview of the Modern Theory</em> <em>and Method of Analytical Psychology</em>. In his preface, dated December 1916, he proclaimed the psychological processes that accompanied the war had brought the problem of the chaotic unconscious to the forefront of attention. However, the psychology of the individual corresponded to the psychology of the nation, and only the transformation of the attitude of the individual could bring about cultural renewal.161 This articulated the intimate interconnection between individual and collective events that was at the center of <em>Liber Novus</em>. For Jung, the conjunction between his precognitive visions and the outbreak of war had made apparent the deep subliminal connections between individual fantasies and world events—and hence between the psychology of the individual and that of the nation. What was now required was to work out this connection in more detail.</p>
<p>Jung noted that after one had analyzed and integrated the contents of the personal unconscious, one came up against mythological fantasies that stemmed from the phylogenetic layer of the unconscious.162 <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes</em> provided an exposition of the collective, suprapersonal, absolute unconscious—these terms being used interchangeably. Jung argued that one needed to separate oneself from the unconscious by presenting it visibly as something separate from one. It was vital to differentiate the I from the non-I, namely, the collective psyche or absolute unconscious. To do this, “<em>man must necessarily stand</em> <em>upon firm feet</em> in his I-function; <em>that is, he must fulfil his duty toward life completely, so that he may in every respect be a vitally living member of society.</em>”163 Jung had been endeavoring to accomplish these tasks during this period.</p>
<p>The contents of this unconscious were what Jung in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> had called typical myths or primordial images. He described these “dominants” as “the ruling powers, the Gods, that is, images of dominating laws and principles, average regularities in the sequence of images, that the brain has received from the sequence of secular processes.”164 One needed to pay particular attention to these dominants. Particularly important was the “<em>detachment of the mythological or collective psychological contents from the objects of consciousness, and their consolidation as psychological realities outside the individual psyche.</em>”165 This enabled one to come to terms with activated residues of our ancestral history. The differentiation of the personal from the nonpersonal resulted in a release of energy.</p>
<p>These comments also mirror his activity: his attempt to differentiate the various characters which appeared, and to “consolidate them as psychological realities.” The notion that these figures had a psychological reality in their own right, and were not merely subjective figments, was the main lesson that he attributed to the fantasy figure of Elijah: psychic objectivity.166</p>
<p>Jung argued that the era of reason and skepticism inaugurated by the French Revolution had repressed religion and irrationalism. This in turn had serious consequences, leading to the outbreak of irrationalism represented by the world war. It was thus a historical necessity to acknowledge the irrational as a psychological factor. The acceptance of the irrational forms one of the central themes of <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes</em>, Jung developed his conception of the psychological types. He noted that it was a common development that the psychological characteristics of the types were pushed to extremes. By what he termed the law of enantiodromia, or the reversal into the opposite, the other function entered in, namely, feeling for the introvert, and thinking for the extravert. These secondary functions were found in the unconscious. The development of the contrary function led to individuation. As the contrary function was not acceptable to consciousness, a special technique was required to come to terms with it, namely the production of the transcendent function. The unconscious was a danger when one was not at one with it. But with the establishment of the transcendent function, the disharmony ceased. This rebalancing gave access to the productive and beneficent aspects of the unconscious. The unconscious contained the wisdom and experience of untold ages, and thus formed an unparalleled guide. The development of the contrary function appears in the “Mysterium” section of <em>Liber Novus</em>.167 The attempt to gain the wisdom stored in the unconscious is portrayed throughout the book, in which Jung asks his soul to tell him what she sees and the meaning of his fantasies. The unconscious is here viewed as a source of higher wisdom. He concluded the essay by indicating the personal and experiential nature of his new conceptions: “Our age is seeking a new spring of life. I found one and drank of it and the water tasted good.”168</p>
<p>The Way to the Self</p>
<p>In 1918, Jung wrote a paper entitled “On the unconscious,” where he noted that all of us stood between two worlds: the world of external perception and the world of perception of the unconscious. This distinction depicts his experience at this time. He wrote that Friedrich Schiller had claimed that the approximation of these two worlds was through art. By contrast, Jung argued, “I am of the opinion that the union of rational and irrational truth is to be found not so much in art as in the symbol <em>per se</em>; for it is the essence of the symbol to contain both the rational and irrational.”169 Symbols, he maintained, stemmed from the unconscious, and the creation of symbols was the most important function of the unconscious. While the compensatory function of the unconscious was always present, the symbol-creating function was present only when we were willing to recognize it. Here, we see him continuing to eschew viewing his productions as art. It was not art but symbols which were of paramount importance here. The recognition and recuperation of this symbol-creating power is portrayed in <em>Liber Novus</em>. It depicts Jung’s attempt to understand the psychological nature of symbolism and to view his fantasies symbolically. He concluded that what was unconscious at any given epoch was only relative, and changing. What was required now was the “remolding of our views in accordance with the active forces of the unconscious.”170 Thus the task confronting him was one of translating the conceptions gained through his confrontation with the unconscious, and expressed in a literary and symbolic manner in <em>Liber Novus</em>, into a language that was compatible with the contemporary outlook.</p>
<p>The following year, he presented a paper in England before the Society of Psychical Research, of which he was an honorary member, on “The psychological foundations of the belief in spirits.”171 He differentiated between two situations in which the collective unconscious became active. In the first, it became activated through a crisis in an individual’s life and the collapse of hopes and expectations. In the second, it became activated at times of great social, political, and religious upheaval. At such moments, the factors suppressed by the prevailing attitudes accumulate in the collective unconscious. Strongly intuitive individuals become aware of these and try to translate them into communicable ideas. If they succeeded in translating the unconscious into a communicable language, this had a redeeming effect. The contents of the unconscious had a disturbing effect. In the first situation, the collective unconscious might replace reality, which is pathological. In the second situation, the individual may feel disorientated, but the state is not pathological. This differentiation suggests that Jung viewed his own experience as falling under the second heading—namely, the activation of the collective unconscious due to the general cultural upheaval. Thus his initial fear of impending insanity in 1913 lay in his failure to realize this distinction.</p>
<p>In 1918, he presented a series of seminars to the Psychological Club on his work on typology, and was engaged in extensive scholarly research on this subject at this time. He developed and expanded the themes articulated in these papers in 1921 in <em>Psychological Types</em>. As regards the working over of themes of <em>Liber Novus</em>, the most important section was chapter 5, “The type problem in poetry.” The basic issue discussed here was how the problem of opposites could be resolved through the production of the uniting or reconciling symbol. This forms one of the central themes of <em>Liber Novus</em>. Jung presented detailed analysis of the issue of the resolution of the problem of opposites in Hinduism, Taoism, Meister Eckhart, and, in present times, in the work of Carl Spitteler. This chapter can also be read in terms of a meditation on some of the historical sources that directly informed his conceptions in <em>Liber Novus</em>. It also heralded the introduction of an important method. Rather than directly discussing the issue of the reconciliation of opposites in <em>Liber Novus</em>, he sought out historical analogies and commented upon them.</p>
<p>In 1921, the “self” emerged as a psychological concept. Jung defined it as follows:</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the I is only the center of my field of consciousness, it is not identical with the totality of my psyche, being merely a complex among other complexes. Hence I discriminate between the <em>I</em> and the <em>self</em>, since the I is only the subject of my consciousness, while the self is the subject of my totality: hence it also includes the unconscious psyche. In this sense the self would be an (ideal) greatness which embraces and includes the I. In unconscious fantasy the self often appears as the super-ordinated or ideal personality, as Faust is in relation to Goethe and Zarathustra to Nietzsche.172</p>
<p>He equated the Hindu notion of Brahman/Atman with the self. At the same time, Jung provided a definition of the soul. He argued that the soul possessed qualities that were complementary to the persona, containing those qualities that the conscious attitude lacked. This complementary character of the soul also affected its sexual character, so that a man had a feminine soul, or anima, and a woman had a masculine soul, or animus.173 This corresponded to the fact that men and women had both masculine and feminine traits. He also noted that the soul gave rise to images that were assumed to be worthless from the rational perspective. There were four ways of using them:</p>
<p>The first possibility of making use of them is <em>artistic</em>, if one is in any way gifted in that direction; a second is <em>philosophical speculation</em>; a third is <em>quasi-religious</em>, leading to heresy and the founding of sects; and a fourth way of employing the <em>dynamis</em> of these images is to squander it in every form of licentiousness.174</p>
<p>From this perspective, the psychological utilization of these images would represent a “fifth way.” For it to succeed, psychology had to distinguish itself clearly from art, philosophy, and religion. This necessity accounts for Jung’s rejection of the alternatives.</p>
<p>In the subsequent <em>Black Books</em>, he continued to elaborate his “mythology.” The figures developed and transformed into one another. The differentiation of the figures was accompanied by their coalescence, as he came to regard them as aspects of underlying components of the personality. On January 5, 1922, he had a conversation with his soul concerning both his vocation and <em>Liber Novus</em>:</p>
<p>[I:] I feel that I must speak to you. Why do you not let me sleep, as I am tired? I feel that the disturbance comes from you. What induces you to keep me awake?<br>
[Soul:] Now is no time to sleep, but you should be awake and prepare important matters in nocturnal work.The great work begins.<br>
[I:] What great work?<br>
[Soul:] The work that should now be undertaken. It is a great and difficult work. There is no time to sleep, if you find no time during the day to remain in the work.<br>
[I:] But I had no idea that something of this kind was taking place.<br>
[Soul:] But you could have told by the fact that I have been disturbing your sleep for a long time. You have been too unconscious for a long time. Now you must go to a higher level of consciousness.<br>
[I:] I am ready. What is it? Speak!<br>
[Soul:] You should listen: to no longer be a Christian is easy. But what next? For more is yet to come. Everything is waiting for you. And you? You remain silent and have nothing to say. But you should speak. Why have you received the revelation? You should not hide it. You concern yourself with the form? Is the form important, when it is a matter of revelation?<br>
[I:] But you are not thinking that I should publish what I have written? That would be a misfortune. And who would understand it?<br>
[Soul:] No, listen! You should not break up a marriage, namely the marriage with me, no person should supplant me . . . I want to rule alone.<br>
[I:] So you want to rule? From whence do you take the right for such a presumption?<br>
[Soul:] This right comes to me because I serve you and your calling. I could just as well say, you came first, but above all your calling comes first.<br>
[I:] But what is my calling?<br>
[Soul:] The new religion and its proclamation.<br>
[I:] Oh God, how should I do this?<br>
[Soul:] Do not be of such little faith. No one knows it as you do. There is no one who could say it as well as you could.<br>
[I:] But who knows, if you are not lying?<br>
[Soul:] Ask yourself if I am lying. I speak the truth.175</p>
<p>His soul here pointedly urged him to publish his material, at which he balked. Three days later, his soul informed him that the new religion “expresses itself only in the transformation of human relations. Relations do not let themselves be replaced by the deepest knowledge. Moreover a religion does not consist only in knowledge, but at its visible level in a new ordering of human affairs. Therefore expect no further knowledge from me. You know everything that is to be known about the manifested revelation, but you do not yet live everything that is to be lived at this time.” Jung’s “1” replied, “I can fully understand and accept this. However, it is dark to me, how the knowledge could be transformed into life. You must teach me this.” His soul said, “There is not much to say about this. It is not as rational as you are inclined to think. The way is symbolic.”176</p>
<p>Thus the task confronting Jung was how to realize and embody what he had learned through his self-investigation into life. During this period the themes of the psychology of religion and the relation of religion to psychology became increasingly prominent in his work, starting from his seminar in Polzeath in Cornwall in 1923. He attempted to develop a psychology of the religious-making process. Rather than proclaiming a new prophetic revelation, his interest lay in the psychology of religious experiences. The task was to depict the translation and transposition of the numinous experience of individuals into symbols, and eventually into the dogmas and creeds of organized religions, and, finally, to study the psychological function of such symbols. For such a psychology of the religion-making process to succeed, it was essential that analytical psychology, while providing an affirmation of the religious attitude, did not succumb to becoming a creed.177</p>
<p>In 1922, Jung wrote a paper on “The relation of analytical psychology to poetic art works.” He differentiated two types of work: the first, which sprang entirely from the author’s intention, and the second, which seized the author. Examples of such symbolic works were the second part of Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> and Nietzsche’s <em>Zarathustra</em>. He held that these works stemmed from the collective unconscious. In such instances, the creative process consisted in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image. The archetypes released in us a voice that was stronger than our own:</p>
<p>Whoever speaks in primordial images speaks with a thousand voices; he enthrals and overpowers . . . he transmutes our personal destiny into the destiny of mankind, and evokes in us all those beneficent forces that ever and anon have enabled humanity to find a refuge from every peril and to outlive the longest night.178</p>
<p>The artist who produced such works educated the spirit of the age, and compensated the one-sidedness of the present. In describing the genesis of such symbolic works, Jung seemingly had his own activities in mind. Thus while Jung refused to regard <em>Liber Novus</em> as “art,” his reflections on its composition were nevertheless a critical source of his subsequent conceptions and theories of art. The implicit question that this paper raised was whether psychology could now serve this function of educating the spirit of the age and compensating the one-sidedness of the present. From this period onward, he came to conceive of the task of his psychology in precisely such a manner.179</p>
<p>Publication Deliberations</p>
<p>From 1922 onward, in addition to discussions with Emma Jung and Toni Wolff, Jung had extensive discussions with Cary Baynes and Wolfgang Stockmayer concerning what to do with <em>Liber Novus</em>, and around its potential publication. Because these discussions took place when he was still working on it, they are critically important. Cary Fink was born in 1883. She studied at Vassar College, where she was taught by Kristine Mann, who became one of Jung’s earliest followers in the United States. In 1910, she married Jaime de Angulo, and completed her medical training at Johns Hopkins in 1911. In 1921, she left him, and went to Zürich with Kristine Mann. She entered analysis with Jung. She never practiced analysis, and Jung highly respected her critical intelligence. In 1927, she married Peter Baynes. They were subsequently divorced in 1931. Jung asked her to make a fresh transcription of <em>Liber Novus</em>, because he had added a lot of material since the previous transcription. She undertook this in 1924 and 1925, when Jung was in Africa. Her typewriter was heavy, so she first copied it by hand and then typed it out.</p>
<p>These notes recount her discussions with Jung and are written in the form of letters to him, but were not sent.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 2, 1922</p>
<p>In another book of Meyrink’s the “White Dominican,” you said he made use of exactly the same symbolism that had come to you in the first vision that revealed to your unconscious. Furthermore you said, he had spoken of a “Red Book” which contained certain mysteries and the book that you are writing about the unconscious, you have called the “Red Book” .180 Then you said you were in doubt as to what to do about that book. Meyrink you said could throw his into novel form and it was all right, but you could only command the scientific and philosophical method and that stuff you couldn’t cast into that mold. I said you could use the Zarathustra form and you said that was true, but you were sick of that. I am too. Then you said you had thought of making an autobiography out of it. That would seem to me by far the best, because then you would tend to write as you spoke which was in a very colorful way. But apart from any difficulty with the form, you said you dreaded making it public because it was like selling your house. But I jumped upon you with both feet there and said it wasn’t a bit like that because you and the book stood for a constellation of the Universe, and that to take the book as being purely personal was to identify yourself with it which was something you would not think of permitting to your patients . . . Then we laughed over my having caught you red-handed as it were. Goethe had been caught in the same difficulty in the 2nd part of Faust in which he had gotten into the unconscious and found it so difficult to get the right form that he had finally died leaving the Mss. as such in his drawer. So much of what you had experienced you said, would be counted as sheer lunacy that if it were published you would lose out altogether not only as a scientist, but as a human being, but not I said if you went at it from the Dichtung und Wahrheit [Poetry and Truth] angle, then people could make their own selection as to which was which.181 You objected to presenting any of it as Dichtung when it was <em>all</em> Wahrheit, but it does not seem to me falseness to make use of that much of a mask in order to protect yourself from Philistia—and after all, as I said Philistia has its rights, confronted with the choice of you as a lunatic, and themselves as inexperienced fools they <em>have</em> to choose the former alternative, but if they can place you as a poet, their faces are saved. Much of your material you said has come to you as runes &amp; the explanation of those runes sounds like the veriest nonsense, but that does not matter if the end product is sense. In your case I said, apparently you have become conscious of more of the steps of creation than ever anyone before. In most cases the mind evidently drops out of the irrelevant stuff automatically and delivers the end product, whereas you bring along the whole business, matrix process and product. Naturally it is frightfully more difficult to handle. Then my hour was up.</p>
<p>JANUARY 1923</p>
<p>What you told me some time ago set me thinking, and suddenly the other day while I was reading the “Vorspiel auf dem Theater” [prelude in the theater],182 it came to me that you too ought to make use of that principle which Goethe has handled so beautifully all through Faust, namely, the placing in opposition of the creative and eternal with the negative and transient. You may not see right away what this has to do with the Red Book, but I will explain. As I understand it in this book you are going to challenge men to a new way of looking at their souls, at any rate there is going to be in it a good deal that will be out of the grasp of the ordinary man, just as at one period of your own life you would scarcely have understood it. In a way it is a “jewel” you are giving to the world is it not? My idea is that it needs a sort of protection in order not to be thrown into the gutter and finally made away with by a strangely clad Jew.</p>
<p>The best protection you could devise, it seems to me, would be to put in incorporate the book itself an exposition of the forces that will attempt to destroy it. It is one of your great gifts strength of seeing the black as well as the white of every given situation, so you will know better than most of the people who attack the book, what it is that they want to destroy. Could you not take the wind out of their sails by writing their criticism for them? Perhaps that is the very thing you have done in the introduction. Perhaps you would rather assume towards the public the attitude of “Take or leave it, and be blessed or be damned whichever you prefer.” That would be all right, whatever there is of truth in it is going to survive in any case. But I would like to see you do the other thing if it did not call for too much effort.</p>
<p>JANUARY 26, 1924</p>
<p>You had the night before had a dream in which I appeared in a disguise and was to do work on the Red Book and you had been thinking about it all that day and during Dr. Wharton’s hour preceding mine especially (pleasant for her I must say) . . . As you had said you had made up your mind to turn over to me all of your unconscious material represented by the Red Book etc. to see what I as a stranger and impartial observer would say about it. You thought I had a good critique and an impartial one. Toni you said was deeply interwoven with it and besides did not take any interest in the thing in itself, nor in getting it into usable form. She is lost in “bird fluttering” you said. For yourself, you said you had always known what to do with your ideas, but here you were baffled. When you approached them you became enmeshed as it were and could no longer be sure of anything. You were certain some of them had great importance, but you could not find the appropriate form—as they were now you said they might come out of a madhouse. So then you said I was to copy down the contents of the Red Book—once before you had had it copied, but you had since then added a great deal of material, so you wanted it done again and you would explain things to me as I went along, for you understood nearly everything in it you said. In this way we could come to discuss many things which never came up in my analysis and I could understand your ideas from the foundation. You told me then something more of your own attitude toward the “Red Book.” You said some of it hurt your sense of the fitness of things terribly, and that you had shrunk from putting it down as it came to you, but that you had started on the principle of “voluntariness” that is of making no corrections and so you had stuck to that. Some of the pictures were absolutely infantile, but were intended so to be. There were various figures speaking, Elias, Father Philemon, etc. but all appeared to be phases of what you thought ought to be called “the master.” You were sure that this latter was the same who inspired Buddha, Mani, Christ, Mahomet—all those who may be said to have communed with God.183 But the others had identified with him. You absolutely refused to. It could not be for you, you said, you had to remain the psychologist—the person who understood the process. I said then that the thing to be done was to enable the world to understand the process also without their getting the notion that they had the Master caged as it were at their beck &amp; call. They had to think of him as a pillar of fire perpetually moving on and forever out of human grasp. Yes, you said it was something like that. Perhaps it cannot yet be done. As you talked I grew more and more aware of the immeasurability of the ideas which are filling you. You said they had the shadow of eternity upon them and I could feel the truth of it.184</p>
<p>On January 30, she noted that Jung said of a dream which she had told him:</p>
<p>That it was a preparation for the Red Book, because the Red Book told of the battle between the world of reality and the world of the spirit. You said in that battle you had been very nearly torn asunder but that you had managed to keep your feet on the earth &amp; make an effect on reality. That you said for you was the test of any idea, and that you had no respect for any ideas however winged that had to exist off in space and were unable to make an impression on reality.185</p>
<p>There is an undated fragment of a letter draft to an unidentified person in which Cary Baynes expresses her view of the significance of <em>Liber Novus</em>, and the necessity of its publication:</p>
<p>I am absolutely thunderstruck, for example, as I read the Red Book, and see all that is told there for the <em>Right Way</em> for us of today, to find how Toni has kept it out of her system. She wouldn’t have an unconscious spot in her psyche had she digested even as much of the Red Book as I have read &amp; that I should think was not a third or a fourth. And another difficult thing to understand is why she has no interest in seeing him publish it. There are people in my country who would read it from cover to cover without stopping to breathe scarcely, so does it re-envisage and clarify the things that are today, staggering everyone who is trying to find the clue to life . . . he has put into it all the vigor and color of his speech, all the directness and simplicity that come when as at Cornwall the fire burns in him.186</p>
<p>Of course it may be that as he says, if he published it as it is, he would forever be hors du combat in the world of rational science, but then there must be some way around that, some way of protecting himself against stupidity, in order that the people who would want the book need not go without for the time it will take the majority to get ready for it. I always knew he must be able to write the fire that he can speak—and here it is. His published books are doctored up for the world at large, or rather they are written out of his head &amp; this out of his heart.187</p>
<p>These discussions vividly portray the depth of Jung’s deliberations concerning the publication of <em>Liber Novus</em>, his sense of its centrality in comprehending the genesis of his work, and his fear that the work would be misunderstood. The impression that the style of the work would make on an unsuspecting public strongly concerned Jung. He later recalled to Aniela Jaffé that the work still needed a suitable form in which it could be brought into the world because it sounded like prophecy, which was not to his taste.188</p>
<p>There appears to have been some discussion concerning these issues in Jung’s circle. On May 29, 1924, Cary Baynes noted a discussion with Peter Baynes in which he argued that <em>Liber Novus</em> could be understood only by someone who had known Jung. By contrast, she thought that the book</p>
<p>was the record of the passage of the universe through the soul of a man, and just as a person stands by the sea and listens to that very strange and awful music and cannot explain why his heart aches, or why a cry of exaltation wants to leap from his throat, so I thought it would be with the <em>Red Book</em>, and that a man would be perforce lifted out of himself by the majesty of it, and swung to heights he had never been before.189</p>
<p>There are further signs that Jung circulated copies of <em>Liber Novus</em> to confidantes, and that the material was discussed together with the possibilities of its publication. One such colleague was Wolfgang Stockmayer. Jung met Stockmayer in 1907. In his unpublished obituary, Jung nominated him as the first German to be interested in his work. He recalled that Stockmayer was a true friend. They traveled together in Italy and Switzerland, and there was seldom a year in which they did not meet. Jung commented:</p>
<p>He distinguished himself through his great interest and equally great understanding for pathological psychic processes. I also found with him a sympathetic reception for my broader viewpoint, which became of importance for my later comparative psychological works.190</p>
<p>Stockmayer accompanied Jung in “the valuable penetration of our psychology” into classical Chinese philosophy, the mystical speculations of India and Tantric yoga.191</p>
<p>On December 22, 1924, Stockmayer wrote to Jung:</p>
<p>I often long for the <em>Red Book</em>, and I would like to have a transcript of what is available; I failed to do so when I had it, as things go. I recently fantasized about a kind of journal of “Documents” in a loose form for materials from the “forge of the unconscious,” with words and colors.192</p>
<p>It appears that Jung sent some material to him. On April 30, 1925, Stockmayer wrote to Jung:</p>
<p>In the meantime we have gone through “Scrutinies,” and it is the same impression as with the great wandering.193 A selected collective milieu for such from the Red Book is certainly worth trying out, although your commentary would be quite desired. Since a certain adjacent center of yours lies here, ample access to sources is of great significance, consciously and unconsciously. And I obviously fantasize about “facsimiles,” which you will understand: you need not fear extraversion magic from me. Painting also has great appeal.194</p>
<p>Jung’s manuscript “Commentaries” (see Appendix B) was possibly connected with these discussions.</p>
<p>Thus figures in Jung’s circle held differing views concerning the significance of <em>Liber Novus</em> and whether it should be published, which may have had bearings on Jung’s eventual decisions. Cary Baynes did not complete the transcription, getting as far as the first twenty-seven pages of <em>Scrutinies</em>. For the next few years, her time was taken up with the translation of Jung’s essays into English, followed by the translation of the <em>I Ching</em>.</p>
<p>At some stage, which I estimate to be in the mid-twenties, Jung went back to the <em>Draft</em> and edited it again, deleting and adding material on approximately 250 pages. His revisions served to modernize the language and terminology.195 He also revised some of the material that he had already transcribed into the calligraphic volume of <em>Liber Novus</em>, as well as some material that was left out. It is hard to see why he undertook this unless he was seriously considering publishing it.</p>
<p>In 1925, Jung presented his seminars on analytical psychology to the Psychological Club. Here, he discussed some of the important fantasies in <em>Liber Novus</em>. He described how they unfolded and indicated how they formed the basis of the ideas in <em>Psychological Types</em> and the key to understanding its genesis. The seminar was transcribed and edited by Cary Baynes. That same year, Peter Baynes prepared an English translation of the <em>Septem Sermones ad Mortuos</em>, which was privately published.196 Jung gave copies to some of his English-speaking students. In a letter that is presumably a reply to one from Henry Murray thanking him for a copy, Jung wrote:</p>
<p>I am deeply convinced, that those ideas that came to me, are really quite wonderful things. I can easily say that (without blushing), because I know, how resistant and how foolishly obstinate I was, when they first visited me and what a trouble it was, until I could read this symbolic language, so much superior to my dull conscious mind.197</p>
<p>It is possible that Jung may have considered the publication of the <em>Sermones</em> as a trial for the publication of <em>Liber Novus</em>. Barbara Hannah claims that he regretted publishing it and that “he felt strongly that it should only have been written in the <em>Red Book</em>.”198</p>
<p>At some point, Jung wrote a manuscript entitled “Commentaries,” which provided a commentary on chapters 9, 10, and 11 of <em>Liber Primus</em> (see Appendix B). He had discussed some of these fantasies in his 1925 seminar, and he goes into more detail here. From the style and conceptions, I would estimate that this text was written in the mid-twenties. He may have written—or intended to write—further “commentaries” for other chapters, but these have not come to light. This manuscript indicates the amount of work he put into understanding each and every detail of his fantasies.</p>
<p>Jung gave a number of people copies of <em>Liber Novus</em>: Cary Baynes, Peter Baynes, Aniela Jaffé, Wolfgang Stockmayer, and Toni Wolff. Copies may also have been given to others. In 1937, a fire destroyed Peter Baynes’s house, and damaged his copy of <em>Liber Novus</em>. A few years later, he wrote to Jung asking if by chance he had another copy, and offered to translate it.199 Jung replied: “I will try whether I can procure another copy of the Red Book. Please don’t worry about translations. I am sure there are 2 or 3 translations already. But I don’t know of what and by whom.”200 This supposition was presumably based on the number of copies of the work in circulation.</p>
<p>Jung let the following individuals read and/or look at <em>Liber Novus</em>: Richard Hull, Tina Keller, James Kirsch, Ximena Roelli de Angulo (as a child), and Kurt Wolff. Aniela Jaffé read the <em>Black Books</em>, and Tina Keller was also allowed to read sections of the <em>Black Books</em>. Jung most likely showed the book to other close associates, such as Emil Medtner, Franz Riklin Sr., Erika Schlegel, Hans Trüb, and Marie-Louise von Franz. It appears that he allowed those people to read <em>Liber Novus</em> whom he fully trusted and whom he felt had a full grasp of his ideas. Quite a number of his students did not fit into this category.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Psychotherapy</p>
<p><em>Liber Novus</em> is of critical significance for grasping the emergence of Jung’s new model of psychotherapy. In 1912, in <em>Transformation and Symbols of the Libido</em>, he considered the presence of mythological fantasies—such as are present in <em>Liber Novus</em>—to be the signs of a loosening of the phylogenetic layers of the unconscious, and indicative of schizophrenia. Through his self-experimentation, he radically revised this position: what he now considered critical was not the presence of any particular content, but the attitude of the individual toward it and, in particular, whether an individual could accommodate such material in their worldview. This explains why he commented in his afterword to <em>Liber Novus</em> that to the superficial observer, the work would seem like madness, and could have become so, if he had failed to contain and comprehend the experiences.201 In <em>Liber Secundus</em>, chapter 15, he presents a critique of contemporary psychiatry, highlighting its incapacity to differentiate religious experience or divine madness from psychopathology. If the content of visions or fantasies had no diagnostic value, he held that it was nevertheless critical to view them carefully.202</p>
<p>Out of his experiences, he developed new conceptions of the aims and methods of psychotherapy. Since its inception at the end of the nineteenth century, modern psychotherapy had been primarily concerned with the treatment of functional nervous disorders, or neuroses, as they came to be known. From the time of the First World War onward, Jung reformulated the practice of psychotherapy. No longer solely preoccupied with the treatment of psychopathology, it became a practice to enable the higher development of the individual through fostering the individuation process. This was to have far-reaching consequences not only for the development of analytical psychology but also for psychotherapy as a whole.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the validity of the conceptions that he derived in <em>Liber Novus</em>, Jung attempted to show that the processes depicted within it were not unique and that the conceptions which he developed in it were applicable to others. To study the productions of his patients, he built up an extensive collection of their paintings. So that his patients were not separated from their images, he would generally ask them to make copies for him.203</p>
<p>During this period, he continued to instruct his patients as to how to induce visions in a waking state. In 1926, Christiana Morgan came to Jung for analysis. She had been drawn to his ideas on reading <em>Psychological Types</em>, and turned to him for assistance with her problems with relationships and her depressions. In a session in 1926, Morgan noted Jung’s advice to her on how to produce visions:</p>
<p>Well, you see these are too vague for me to be able to say much about them. They are only the beginning. You only use the retina of the eye at first in order to objectify. Then instead of keeping on trying to force the image out you just want to look in. Now when you see these images you want to hold them and see where they take you—how they change. And you want to try to get into the picture yourself—to become one of the actors. When I first began to do this I saw landscapes. Then I learned how to put myself into the landscape, and the figures would talk to me and I would answer them . . . People said he has an artistic temperament. But it was only that my unconscious was swaying me. Now I learn to act its drama as well as the drama of the outer life &amp; so nothing can hurt me now. I have written 1000 pages of material from the unconscious (Told the vision of a giant who turned into an egg).204</p>
<p>He described his own experiments in detail to his patients, and instructed them to follow suit. His role was one of supervising them in experimenting with their own stream of images. Morgan noted Jung saying:</p>
<p>Now I feel as though I ought to say something to you about these phantasies . . . The phantasies now seem to be rather thin and full of repetitions of the same motives. There isn’t enough fire and heat in them. They ought to be more burning . . . You must be in them more, that is you must be your own conscious critical self in them—imposing your own judgments and criticisms . . . I can explain what I mean by telling you of my own experience. I was writing in my book and suddenly saw a man standing watch over my shoulder. One of the gold dots from my book flew up and hit him in the eye. He asked me if I would take it out. I said no—not unless he told me who he was. He said he wouldn’t. You see I knew that. If I had done what he asked then he would have sunk into the unconscious and I would have missed the point of it ie.: why he had appeared from the unconscious at all. finally he told me that he would tell me the meaning of certain hieroglyphs which I had had a few days previous. This he did and I took the thing out of his eye and he vanished.205</p>
<p>Jung went so far as to suggest that his patients prepare their own <em>Red Books</em>. Morgan recalled him saying:</p>
<p>I should advise you to put it all down as beautifully as you can—in some beautifully bound book. It will seem as if you were making the visions banal—but then you need to do that—then you are freed from the power of them. If you do that with these eyes for instance they will cease to draw you. You should never try to make the visions come again. Think of it in your imagination and try to paint it. Then when these things are in some precious book you can go to the book &amp; turn over the pages &amp; for you it will be your church—your cathedral—the silent places of your spirit where you will find renewal. If anyone tells you that it is morbid or neurotic and you listen to them—then you will lose your soul—for in that book is your soul.206</p>
<p>In a letter to J. A. Gilbert in 1929, he commented on his procedure:</p>
<p>I found sometimes, that it is of great help in handling such a case, to encourage them, to express their peculiar contents either in the form of writing or of drawing and painting. There are so many incomprehensible intuitions in such cases, phantasy fragments that rise from the unconscious, for which there is almost no suitable language. I let my patients find their own symbolic expressions, their “mythology.”207</p>
<p>Philemon’s Sanctuary</p>
<p>In the 1920s, Jung’s interest increasingly shifted from the transcription of <em>Liber Novus</em> and the elaboration of his mythology in the <em>Black Books</em> to working on his tower in Bollingen. In 1920, he purchased some land on the upper shores of Lake Zürich in Bollingen. Prior to this, he and his family sometimes spent holidays camping around Lake Zürich. He felt the need to represent his innermost thoughts in stone and to build a completely primitive dwelling: “Words and paper, however, did not seem real enough to me; something more was needed.”208 He had to make a confession in stone. The tower was a “representation of individuation.” Over the years, he painted murals and made carvings on the walls. The tower may be regarded as a three-dimensional continuation of <em>Liber Novus</em>: its “<em>Liber Quartus</em>.” At the end of <em>Liber Secundus</em>, Jung wrote: “I must catch up with a piece of the Middle Ages—within myself. We have only finished the Middle Ages of—others. I must begin early, in that period when the hermits died out.”209 Significantly, the tower was deliberately built as a structure from the Middle Ages, with no modern amenities. The tower was an ongoing, evolving work. He carved this inscription on its wall: “Philemonis sacrum—Fausti poenitentia” (Philemon’s Shrine—Faust’s Repentance). (One of the murals in the tower is a portrait of Philemon.) On April 6, 1929, Jung wrote to Richard Wilhelm: “Why are there no worldly cloisters for men, who should live outside the times!”210</p>
<p>On January 9, 1923, Jung’s mother died. On December 23/24, December, 1923, he had the following dream:</p>
<p>I am on military service. Marching with a battalion. In a wood by Ossingen I come across excavations at a crossroads: 1 meter high stone figure of a frog or a toad with a head. Behind this sits a boy with a toad’s head. Then the bust of a man with an anchor hammered into the region of his heart, Roman. A second bust from around 1640, the same motif. Then mummified corpses. finally there comes a barouche in the style of the seventeenth century. In it sits someone who is dead, but still alive. She turns her head, when I address her as “Miss”; I am aware that “Miss” is a title of nobility.211</p>
<p>A few years later, he grasped the significance of this dream. He noted on December 4, 1926:</p>
<p>Only now do I see for that the dream of 23/24 December 1923 means the death of the anima (“She does not know that she is dead” ). This coincides with the death of my mother . . . Since the death of my mother, the A. [Anima] has fallen silent. Meaningful!212</p>
<p>A few years later, he had a few further dialogues with his soul, but his confrontation with the anima had effectively reached a closure at this point. On January 2, 1927, he had a dream set in Liverpool:</p>
<p>Several young Swiss and I are down by the docks in Liverpool. It is a dark rainy night, with smoke and clouds. We walk up to the upper part of town, which lies on a plateau. We come to a small circular lake in a centrally located garden. In the middle of this there is an island. The men speak of a Swiss who lives here in such a sooty, dark dirty city. But I see that on the island stands a magnolia tree covered with red flowers illuminated by an eternal sun, and think, “Now I know, why this Swiss fellow lives here. He apparently also knows why.” I see a city map: [Plate].213</p>
<p>Jung then painted a mandala based upon this map.214 He attached great significance to this dream, commenting later:</p>
<p>This dream represented my situation at the time. I can still see the grayish-yellowish raincoats, glistening with the wetness of the rain. Everything was extremely unpleasant, black and opaque, just as I felt then. But I had had a vision of unearthly beauty, and that was why I was able to live at all . . . I saw that here the goal had been reached. One could not go beyond the center. The center is the goal, and everything is directed toward that center. Through this dream I understood that the self is the principle and archetype of orientation and meaning.215</p>
<p>Jung added that he himself was the one Swiss. The “I” was not the self, but from there one could see the divine miracle. The small light resembled the great light. Henceforth, he stopped painting mandalas. The dream had expressed the unconscious developmental process, which was not linear, and he found it completely satisfying. He felt utterly alone at that time, preoccupied with something great that others didn’t understand. In the dream, only he saw the tree. While they stood in the darkness, the tree appeared radiantly. Had he not had such a vision, his life would have lost meaning.216</p>
<p>The realization was that the self is the goal of individuation and that the process of individuation was not linear, but consisted in a circumambulation of the self. This realization gave him strength, for otherwise the experience would have driven him or those around him crazy.217 He felt that the mandala drawings showed him the self “in its saving function” and that this was his salvation. The task now was one of consolidating these insights into his life and science.</p>
<p>In his 1926 revision of <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes</em>, he highlighted the significance of the midlife transition. He argued that the first half of life could be characterized as the natural phase, in which the prime aim was establishing oneself in the world, gaining an income, and raising a family. The second half of life could be characterized as the cultural phase, which involved a revaluation of earlier values. The goal in this period was one of conserving previous values together with the recognition of their opposites. This meant that individuals had to develop the undeveloped and neglected aspects of their personality.218 The individuation process was now conceived as the general pattern of human development. He argued that there was a lack of guidance for this transition in contemporary society, and he saw his psychology as filling this lacuna. Outside of analytical psychology, Jung’s formulations have had an impact on the field of adult developmental psychology. Clearly, his crisis experience formed the template for this conception of the requirements of the two halves of life. <em>Liber Novus</em> depicts Jung’s reappraisal of his previous values, and his attempt to develop the neglected aspects of his personality. Thus it formed the basis of his understanding of how the midlife transition could be successfully navigated.</p>
<p>In 1928 he published a small book, <em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious</em>, which was an expansion of his 1916 paper “The structure of the unconscious.” Here, he expanded upon the “interior drama” of the transformation process, adding a section dealing in detail with the process of individuation. He noted that after one had dealt with the fantasies from the personal sphere, one met with fantasies from the impersonal sphere. These were not simply arbitrary, but converged upon a goal. Hence these later fantasies could be described as processes of initiation, which provided their nearest analogy. For this process to take place, active participation was required: “When the conscious mind participates actively and experiences each stage of the process . . . then the next image always starts off on the higher level that has been won, and purposiveness develops.”219</p>
<p>After the assimilation of the personal unconscious, the differentiation of the persona, and the overcoming of the state of godlikeness, the next stage that followed was the integration of the anima for men and of the animus for women. Jung argued that just as it was essential for a man to distinguish between what he was and how he appeared to others, it was equally essential to become conscious of “his invisible relations to the unconscious” and hence to differentiate himself from the anima. He noted that when the anima was unconscious, it was projected. For a child, the first bearer of the soul-image was the mother, and thereafter, the women who aroused a man’s feelings. One needed to objectify the anima and to pose questions to her, by the method of inner dialogue or active imagination. Everyone, he claimed, had this ability to hold dialogues with him- or herself. Active imagination would thus be one form of inner dialogue, a type of dramatized thinking. It was critical to disidentify from the thoughts that arose, and to overcome the assumption that one had produced them oneself.220 What was most essential was not interpreting or understanding the fantasies, but experiencing them. This represented a shift from his emphasis on creative formulation and understanding in his paper on the transcendent function. He argued that one should treat the fantasies completely literally while one was engaged in them, but symbolically when one interpreted them.221 This was a direct description of Jung’s procedure in the <em>Black Books</em>. The task of such discussions was to objectify the effects of the anima and to become conscious of the contents that underlay these, thereby integrating these into consciousness. When one had become familiar with the unconscious processes reflected in the anima, the anima then became a function of the relationship between consciousness and the unconscious, as opposed to an autonomous complex. Again, this process of the integration of the anima was the subject of <em>Liber Novus</em> and the <em>Black Books</em>. (It also highlights the fact that the fantasies in <em>Liber Novus</em> should be read symbolically and not literally. To take statements from them out of context and to cite them literally would represent a serious misunderstanding.) Jung noted that this process had three effects:</p>
<p>The first effect is that the range of consciousness is increased by the inclusion of a great number and variety of unconscious contents. The second is a gradual diminution of the dominating influence of the unconscious. The third is an <em>alteration in the personality</em>.222</p>
<p>After one had achieved the integration of the anima, one was confronted with another figure, namely the “mana personality.” Jung argued that when the anima lost her “mana” or power, the man who assimilated it must have acquired this, and so became a “mana personality,” a being of superior will and wisdom. However, this figure was “a <em>dominant</em> of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the powerful man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine man, and saint, the lord of men and spirits, the friend of Gods.”223 Thus in integrating the anima, and attaining her power, one inevitably identified with the figure of the magician, and one faced the task of differentiating oneself from this. He added that for women, the corresponding figure was that of the Great Mother. If one gave up the claim to victory over the anima, possession by the figure of the magician ceased, and one realized that the mana truly belonged to the “mid-point of the personality,” namely, the self. The assimilation of the contents of the mana personality led to the self. Jung’s description of the encounter with the mana personality, both the identification and subsequent disidentification with it, corresponds to his encounter with Philemon in <em>Liber Novus</em>. Of the self, Jung wrote: “It might as well be called ‘God in us.’ The beginnings of our whole psychic life seem to be inextricably rooted to this point, and all our highest and deepest purposes seem to be striving toward it.”224 Jung’s description of the self conveys the significance of his realization following his Liverpool dream:</p>
<p>The <em>self</em> could be characterized as a kind of compensation for the conflict between inner and outer . . . the self is also the goal of life, because it is the most complete expression of that fateful combination we call individuality . . . With the experiencing of the self as something irrational, as an indefinable being to which the I is neither opposed nor subjected, but in a relation of dependence, and around which it revolves, very much as the earth revolves about the sun—then the goal of individuation has been reached.225</p>
<p>The Confrontation with the World</p>
<p>Why did Jung stop working on <em>Liber Novus</em>? In his afterword, written in 1959, he wrote:</p>
<p>My acquaintance with alchemy in 1930 took me away from it. The beginning of the end came in 1928, when [Richard] Wilhelm sent me the text of the “Golden flower,” an alchemical treatise. There the contents of this book found their way into actuality and I could no longer continue working on it.226</p>
<p>There is one more completed painting in <em>Liber Novus</em>. In 1928, Jung painted a mandala of a golden castle (Page 163, facsimile edition). After painting it, it struck him that the mandala had something Chinese about it. Shortly afterward, Richard Wilhelm sent him the text of <em>The Secret of the Golden Flower</em>, asking him to write a commentary on it. Jung was struck by it and the timing:</p>
<p>The text gave me an undreamed-of confirmation of my ideas about the mandala and the circumambulation of the center. This was the first event which broke through my isolation. I became aware of an affinity; I could establish ties with someone and something.227</p>
<p>The significance of this confirmation is indicated in the lines that he wrote beneath the painting of the Yellow Castle.228 Jung was struck by the correspondences between the imagery and conceptions of this text and his own paintings and fantasies. On May 25, 1929, he wrote to Wilhelm: “Fate appears to have given us the role of two bridge pillars which carry the bridge between East and West.”229 Only later did he realize that the alchemical nature of the text was important.230 He worked on his commentary during 1929. On September 10, 1929, he wrote to Wilhelm: “I am thrilled by this text, which stands so close to our unconscious.”231</p>
<p>Jung’s commentary on <em>The Secret of the Golden Flower</em> was a turning point. It was his first public discussion of the significance of the mandala. For the first time, Jung anonymously presented three of his own paintings from <em>Liber Novus</em> as examples of European mandalas, and commented on them.232 To Wilhelm, he wrote on October 28, 1929, concerning the mandalas in the volume: “the images amplify one another precisely through their diversity. They give an excellent image of the effort of the unconscious European spirit to grasp Eastern eschatology.”233 This connection between the “European unconscious spirit” and Eastern eschatology became one of the major themes in Jung’s work in the 1930s, which he explored through further collaborations with the Indologists Wilhelm Hauer and Heinrich Zimmer.234 At the same time, the form of the work was crucial: rather than revealing the full details of his own experiment, or those of his patients, Jung used the parallels with the Chinese text as an indirect way of speaking about it, much as he had begun to do in chapter 5 of <em>Psychological Types</em>. This allegorical method now became his preferred form. Rather than write directly of his experiences, he commented on analogous developments in esoteric practices, and most of all in medieval alchemy.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Jung abruptly left off working on <em>Liber Novus</em>. The last full-page image was left unfinished, and he stopped transcribing the text. He later recalled that when he reached this central point, or Tao, his confrontation with the world commenced, and he began to give many lectures.235 Thus the “confrontation with the unconscious” drew to a close, and the “confrontation with the world” began. Jung added that he saw these activities as a form of compensation for the years of inner preoccupation.236</p>
<p>The Comparative Study of the Individuation Process</p>
<p>Jung had been familiar with alchemical texts from around 1910. In 1912, Théodore Flournoy had presented a psychological interpretation of alchemy in his lectures at the University of Geneva and, in 1914, Herbert Silberer published an extensive work on the subject.237 Jung’s approach to alchemy followed the work of Flournoy and Silberer, in regarding alchemy from a psychological perspective. His understanding of it was based on two main theses: first, that in meditating on the texts and materials in their laboratories, the alchemists were actually practicing a form of active imagination. Second, that the symbolism in the alchemical texts corresponded to that of the individuation process with which Jung and his patients had been engaged.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Jung’s activity shifted from working on his fantasies in the <em>Black Books</em> to his alchemy copy books. In these, he presented an encyclopedic collection of excerpts from alchemical literature and related works, which he indexed according to key words and subjects. These copy books formed the basis of his writings on the psychology of alchemy.</p>
<p>After 1930, Jung put <em>Liber Novus</em> to one side. While he had stopped working directly on it, it still remained at the center of his activity. In his therapeutic work, he continued to attempt to foster similar developments in his patients, and to establish which aspects of his own experience were singular, and which had some generality and applicability to others. In his symbolic researches, Jung was interested in parallels to the imagery and conceptions of <em>Liber Novus</em>. The question that he pursued was the following: was something akin to the individuation process to be found in all cultures? If so, what were the common and differential elements? In this perspective, Jung’s work after 1930 could be considered as an extended amplification of the contents of <em>Liber Novus</em>, and an attempt to translate its contents into a form acceptable to the contemporary outlook. Some of the statements made in <em>Liber Novus</em> closely correspond to positions that Jung would later articulate in his published works, and represent their first formulations.238 On the other hand, much did not directly find its way into the <em>Collected Works</em>, or was presented in a schematic form, or through allegory and indirect allusion. Thus <em>Liber Novus</em> enables a hitherto unsuspected clarification of the most difficult aspects of Jung’s <em>Collected Works</em>. One is simply not in a position to comprehend the genesis of Jung’s late work, nor to fully understand what he was attempting to achieve, without studying <em>Liber Novus</em>. At the same time, the <em>Collected Works</em> can in part be considered an indirect commentary on <em>Liber Novus</em>. Each mutually explicates the other.</p>
<p>Jung saw his “confrontation with the unconscious” as the source of his later work. He recalled that all his work and everything that he subsequently achieved came from these imaginings. He had expressed things as well as he was able, in clumsy, handicapped language. He often felt as if “gigantic blocks of stone were tumbling down upon [him]. One thunderstorm followed another.” He was amazed it hadn’t broken him as it had done others, such as Schreber.239</p>
<p>When asked by Kurt Wolff in 1957 on the relation between his scholarly works and his biographical notes of dreams and fantasies, Jung replied:</p>
<p>That was the primal stuff that compelled me to work on it, and my work is a more or less successful attempt to incorporate this incandescent matter into the worldview of my time. The first imaginings and dreams were like fiery, molten basalt, from which the stone crystallized, upon which I could work.240</p>
<p>He added that “it has cost me 45 years so to speak, to bring the things that I once experienced and wrote down into the vessel of my scientific work.”241</p>
<p>In Jung’s own terms, <em>Liber Novus</em> could be considered to contain, among other things, an account of stages of his process of individuation. In subsequent works, he tried to point out the general schematic common elements to which he could find parallels in his patients and in comparative research. The later works thus present a skeletal outline, a basic sketch, but left out the main body of detail. In retrospect, he described the <em>Red Book</em> as an attempt to formulate things in terms of revelation. He had hope that this would free him, but found that it didn’t. He then realized that he had to return to the human side and to science. He had to draw conclusions from the insights. The elaboration of the material in the <em>Red Book</em> was vital, but he also had to understand the ethical obligations. In doing so, he had paid with his life and his science.242</p>
<p>In 1930, he commenced a series of seminars on the fantasy visions of Christiana Morgan at the Psychological Club in Zürich, which can in part be regarded as an indirect commentary on <em>Liber Novus</em>. To demonstrate the empirical validity of the conceptions that he derived in the latter, he had to show that processes depicted within it were not unique.</p>
<p>With his seminars on Kundalini Yoga in 1932, Jung commenced a comparative study of esoteric practices, focusing on the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, Patanjali’s Yoga sutras, Buddhist meditational practices, and medieval alchemy, which he presented in an extensive series of lectures at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH).243 The critical insight that enabled these linkages and comparisons was Jung’s realization that these practices were all based on different forms of active imagination—and that they all had as their goal the transformation of the personality—which Jung understood as the process of individuation. Thus Jung’s ETH lectures provide a comparative history of active imagination, the practice that formed the basis of <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>In 1934, he published his first extended case description of the individuation process, which was that of Kristine Mann, who had painted an extensive series of mandalas. He referred to his own undertaking:</p>
<p>I have naturally used this method on myself too and can affirm that one can paint very complicated pictures without having the least idea of their real meaning. While painting them, the picture seems to develop out of itself and often in opposition to one’s conscious intentions.244</p>
<p>He noted that the present work filled a gap in his description of his therapeutic methods, as he had written little about active imagination. He had used this method since 1916, but only sketched it in <em>The Relations of the I to the Unconscious</em> in 1928, and first mentioned the mandala in 1929, in his commentary on <em>The Secret of the Golden Flower</em>:</p>
<p>For at least thirteen years I kept quiet about the results of these methods in order to avoid any suggestion. I wanted to assure myself that these things—mandalas especially—really are produced spontaneously and were not suggested to the patient by my own fantasy.245</p>
<p>Through his historical studies, he convinced himself that mandalas had been produced in all times and places. He also noted that they were produced by patients of psychotherapists who were not his students. This also indicates one consideration that may have led him not to publish <em>Liber Novus</em>: to convince himself, and his critics, that the developments of his patients and especially their mandala images were not simply due to suggestion. He held that the mandala represented one of the best examples of the universality of an archetype. In 1936, he also noted that he himself had used the method of active imagination over a long period of time, and observed many symbols that he had been able to verify only years later in texts that had been unknown to him.246 However, from an evidential standpoint, given the breadth of his learning, Jung’s own material would not have been a particularly convincing example of his thesis that images from the collective unconscious spontaneously emerged without prior acquaintance.</p>
<p>In <em>Liber Novus,</em> Jung articulated his understanding of the historical transformations of Christianity, and the historicity of symbolic formations. He took up this theme in his writings on the psychology of alchemy and on the psychology of Christian dogmas, and most of all in <em>Answer to Job</em>. As we have seen, it was Jung’s view that his prewar visions were prophetic that led to the composition of <em>Liber Novus</em>. In 1952, through his collaboration with the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli, Jung argued that there existed a principle of acausal orderedness that underlay such “meaningful coincidences,” which he called synchronicity.247 He claimed that under certain circumstances, the constellation of an archetype led to a relativization of time and space, which explained how such events could happen. This was an attempt to expand scientific understanding to accommodate events such as his visions of 1913 and 1914.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the relation of <em>Liber Novus</em> to Jung’s scholarly writings did not follow a straight point-by-point translation and elaboration. As early as 1916, Jung sought to convey some of the results of his experiments in a scholarly language, while continuing with the elaboration of his fantasies. One would do best to regard <em>Liber Novus</em> and the <em>Black Books</em> as representing a private opus that ran parallel to and alongside his public scholarly opus; whilst the latter was nourished by and drew from the former, they remained distinct. After ceasing to work on <em>Liber Novus</em>, he continued to elaborate his private opus—his own mythology—in his work on the tower, and in his stone carvings and paintings. Here, <em>Liber Novus</em> functioned as a generating center, and a number of his paintings and carvings relate to it. In psychotherapy, Jung sought to enable his patients to recover a sense of meaning in life through facilitating and supervising their own self-experimentation and symbol creation. At the same time, he attempted to elaborate a general scientific psychology.</p>
<p>The Publication of <em>Liber Novus</em></p>
<p>While Jung had stopped working directly on <em>Liber Novus</em>, the question of what to do with it remained, and the issue of its eventual publication remained open. On April 10, 1942, Jung replied to Mary Mellon concerning a printing of the <em>Sermones</em>: “Concerning the printing of the ‘Seven Sermones’ I should wish you to wait for a while. I had in mind to add certain material, but I have hesitated for years to do it. But at such an occasion one might risk it.”248 In 1944, he had a major heart attack and did not see this plan through.</p>
<p>In 1952, Lucy Heyer put forward a project for a biography of Jung. At Olga Froebe’s suggestion and on Jung’s insistence, Cary Baynes began collaborating with Lucy Heyer on this project. Cary Baynes considered writing a biography of Jung based on <em>Liber Novus</em>.249 To Jung’s disappointment, she withdrew from the project. After several years of interviews with Lucy Heyer, Jung terminated her biographical project in 1955, because he was dissatisfied with her progress. In 1956, Kurt Wolff proposed another biographical project, which became <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>. At some stage, Jung gave Aniela Jaffé a copy of the draft of <em>Liber Novus</em>, which had been made by Toni Wolff. Jung authorized Jaffé to cite from <em>Liber Novus</em> and the <em>Black Books</em> in <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>.250 In his interviews with Aniela Jaffé, Jung discussed <em>Liber Novus</em> and his self-experimentation. Unfortunately, she did not reproduce all his comments.</p>
<p>On October 31, 1957, she wrote to Jack Barrett of the Bollingen Foundation concerning <em>Liber Novus</em>, and informed him that Jung had suggested that it and the <em>Black Books</em> be given to the library of the University of Basel with a restriction of 50 years, 80 years, or longer, as “he hates the idea that anybody should read this material without knowing the relations to his life, etc.” She added that she had decided not to use much of this material in <em>Memories</em>.251 In one early manuscript of <em>Memories</em>, Jaffé had included a transcription of the draft typescript of most of <em>Liber Primus</em>.252 But it was omitted from the final manuscript, and she did not cite from <em>Liber Novus</em> or the <em>Black Books</em>. In the German edition of <em>Memories</em>, Jaffé included Jung’s epilogue to <em>Liber Novus</em> as an appendix. Jung’s flexible date stipulations concerning access to <em>Liber Novus</em> were similar to that which he gave around the same time concerning the publication of his correspondence with Freud.253</p>
<p>On October 12, 1957, Jung told Jaffé that he had never finished the <em>Red Book</em>.254 According to Jaffé, in the spring of the year 1959 Jung, after a time of lengthy ill-health, took up <em>Liber Novus</em> again, to complete the last remaining unfinished image. Once again, he took up the transcription of the manuscript into the calligraphic volume. Jaffé notes, “However, he still could not or would not complete it. He told me that it had to do with death.”255 The calligraphic transcription breaks off midsentence, and Jung added an afterword, which also broke off midsentence. The postscript and Jung’s discussions of its donation to an archive suggest that Jung was aware that the work would eventually be studied at some stage. After Jung’s death, <em>Liber Novus</em> remained with his family, in accordance with his will.</p>
<p>In her 1971 Eranos lecture, “The creative phases in Jung’s life,” Jaffé cited two passages from the draft of <em>Liber Novus</em>, noting that “Jung placed a copy of the manuscript at my disposal with permission to quote from it as occasion arose.”256 This was the only time she did so. Pictures from <em>Liber Novus</em> were also shown in a BBC documentary on Jung narrated by Laurens van der Post in 1972. These created widespread interest in it. In 1975, after the much acclaimed publication of <em>The Freud/Jung Letters</em>, William McGuire, representing Princeton University Press, wrote to the lawyer of the Jung estate, Hans Karrer, with a publication proposal for <em>Liber Novus</em> and a collection of photographs of Jung’s stone carvings, paintings, and the tower. He proposed a facsimile edition, possibly without the text. He wrote that “we are uninformed of the number of its pages, the relative amount of text and pictures, and the content and interest of the text.”257 No one in the press had actually seen or read the work or knew much about it. This request was denied.</p>
<p>In 1975, some reproductions from the calligraphic volume of <em>Liber Novus</em> were displayed at an exhibition commemorating Jung’s centenary in Zürich. In 1977, nine paintings from <em>Liber Novus</em> were published by Jaffé in <em>C. G. Jung: Word and Image</em> and in 1989 a few other related paintings were published by Gerhard Wehr in his illustrated biography of Jung.258</p>
<p>In 1984, <em>Liber Novus</em> was professionally photographed, and five facsimile editions were prepared. These were given to the five families directly descendent from Jung. In 1992, Jung’s family, who had supported the publication of Jung’s <em>Collected Works</em> in German (completed in 1995), commenced an examination of Jung’s unpublished materials. As a result of my researches, I found one transcription and a partial transcription of <em>Liber Novus</em> and presented them to the Jung heirs in 1997. Around the same time, another transcription was presented to the heirs by Marie-Louise von Franz. I was invited to present reports on the subject and its suitability for publication, and made a presentation on the subject. On the basis of these reports and discussions, the heirs decided in May 2000 to release the work for publication.</p>
<p>The work on <em>Liber Novus</em> was at the center of Jung’s self-experimentation. It is nothing less than the central book in his oeuvre. With its publication, one is now in a position to study what took place there on the basis of primary documentation as opposed to the fantasy, gossip, and speculation that makes up too much of what is written on Jung, and to grasp the genesis and constitution of Jung’s later work. For nearly a century, such a reading has simply not been possible, and the vast literature on Jung’s life and work that has arisen has lacked access to the single most important documentary source. This publication marks a caesura, and opens the possibility of a new era in the understanding of Jung’s work. It provides a unique window into how he recovered his soul and, in so doing, constituted a psychology. Thus this introduction does not end with a conclusion, but with the promise of a new beginning.</p>
<p>1.The following draws, at times directly, on my reconstruction of the formation of Jung’s psychology in <em>Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology: The Dream of a Science</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003). Jung referred to the work both as <em>Liber Novus</em> and as <em>The Red Book</em>, as it has become generally known. Because there are indications that the former is its actual title, I have referred to it as such throughout for consistency. A number of these themes are elaborated more fully in my <em>C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books</em> (New York: W. W. Norton, 2012) and in James Hillman and Sonu Shamdasani, <em>The Lament of the Dead: Psychology after Jung’s Red Book</em>, (New York: W. W. Norton, 2013).</p>

<p>11.Emmanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) was a Swedish scientist and Christian mystic. In 1743, he underwent a religious crisis, which is depicted in his <em>Journal of Dreams</em>. In 1745, he had a vision of Christ. He then devoted his life to relating what he had heard and seen in Heaven and Hell and learned from the angels, and in interpreting the internal and symbolic meaning of the Bible. Swedenborg argued that the Bible had two levels of meaning: a physical, literal level, and an inner, spiritual level. These were linked by correspondences. He proclaimed the advent of a “new church” that represented a new spiritual era. According to Swedenborg, from birth one acquired evils from one’s parents which are lodged in the natural man, who is diametrically opposed to the spiritual man. Man is destined for Heaven, and he cannot reach there without spiritual regeneration and a new birth. The means to this lay in charity and faith.

<p>35.In 1925, he gave the following interpretation to this dream: “The meaning of the dream lies in the principle of the ancestral figure: not the Austrian officer—obviously he stood for the Freudian theory—but the other, the Crusader, is an archetypal figure, a Christian symbol living from the twelfth century, a symbol that does not really live today, but on the other hand is not wholly dead either. It comes out of the times of Meister Eckhart, the time of the culture of the Knights, when many ideas blossomed, only to be killed again, but they are coming again to life now. However, when I had this dream, I did not know this interpretation” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, p. 42).</p>

<p>39.Ibid., pp. 40–41. E. A. Bennet noted Jung’s comments on this dream: “At first he thought the ‘twelve dead men’ referred to the twelve days before Christmas for that is the dark time of the year, when traditionally witches are about. To say ‘before Christmas’ is to say ‘before the sun lives again,’ for Christmas day is at the turning point of the year when the sun’s birth was celebrated in the Mithraic religion . . . Only much later did he relate the dream to Hermes and the twelve doves” (<em>Meetings with Jung: Conversations recorded by E. A. Bennet during the Years 1946–1961</em> [London: Anchor Press, 1982; Zürich, Daimon Verlag, 1985], p. 93). In 1951 in “The psychological aspects of the Kore,” Jung presented some material from <em>Liber Novus</em> (describing them all as part of a dream series) in an anonymous form (“case Z.” ), tracing the transformations of the anima. He noted that this dream “shows the anima as elflike, i.e., only partially human. She can just as well be a bird, which means that she may belong wholly to nature and can vanish (i.e., become unconscious) from the human sphere (i.e., consciousness)” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §371).

There is one painting of Riklin’s from 1915/6, <em>Verkündigung,</em> in the Kunsthaus in Zürich, which was donated by Maria Moltzer in 1945. Giacometti recalled: “Riklin’s psychological knowledge was extraordinarily interesting and new to me. He was a modern magician.

It only makes sense when one has the feeling of being up against a blank wall. I experienced this when I separated from Freud. I did not know what I thought. I only felt, ‘It is not so.’ Then I conceived of ‘symbolic thinking’ and after two years of active imagination so many ideas rushed in on me that I could hardly defend myself. The same thoughts recurred. I appealed to my hands and began to carve wood—and then my way became clear” (From <em>Conversations with C. G. Jung</em> [Zürich: Juris Druck Verlag, 1971], p. 18).</p>

On November 11, 1948, he wrote to Piloo Nanavutty, “I find Blake a tantalizing study, since he has compiled a lot of half- or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my idea, they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes” (<em>Letters</em> 2, pp. 513–14).</p>

On another occasion, Katz notes in her diary that Moltzer “spoke of Art, real art, being the expression of religion” (August 24, 1916). In 1916, Moltzer presented psychological interpretations of some of Riklin’s paintings in a talk at the Psychological Club (in my <em>Cult Fictions: Jung and the Founding of Analytical Psychology</em> [London: Routledge, 1998], p. 102).

He added the following definition of this figure: “By <em>shadow</em> I understand the ‘negative’ side of the personality, the sum of all those hidden unpleasant qualities, the insufficiently developed functions and the contents of the personal unconscious” (Ibid., §103n).

In a seminar the following year, Jung took up the theme of the relation of individual relations to religion: “No individual can exist without individual relationships, and that is how the foundation of your Church is laid. Individual relations lay the form of the invisible Church” (<em>Notes on the Seminar in Analytical Psychology conducted by Dr. C. G. Jung</em>, Polzeath, England, July 14–July 27, 1923, arranged by members of the class, p. 82).</p>

It is called the Cinnabar book because, according to ancient belief in China, that red is the colour of the garments of those who have reached the highest stage of perfection and stayed behind on earth for the salvation of mankind” (p. 91). Jung was particularly interested in Meyrink’s novels. In 1921, when referring to the transcendent function and unconscious fantasies, he noted that examples where such material had been subjected to aesthetic elaboration could be found in literature, and that “I would single out two works of Meyrink for special attention: <em>The Golem and The Green Face</em>,” <em>Psychological Types</em>, <em>CW</em> 6, §205. He regarded Meyrink as a “visionary” artist (“Psychology und poetry” [1930], <em>CW</em> 15, §142) and was also interested in Meyrink’s alchemical experiments (<em>Psychology and Alchemy</em> [1944], <em>CW</em> 12, §341n).</p>

In 1961, Aniela Jaffé had shown <em>Liber Novus</em> to Richard Hull, Jung’s translator, and he had written his impressions to McGuire: “She [AJ] showed us the famous Red Book, full of real mad drawings with commentaries in monkish script; I’m not surprised Jung keeps it under lock and key! When he came in and saw it lying—fortunately closed—on the table, he snapped at her: ‘Das soll nicht hier sein. Nehmen Sie’s weg!’ (That should not be here. Take it away!), although she had written me earlier that he had given permission for me to see it. I recognized several of the mandalas that are included in <em>On Mandala Symbolism</em>. It would make a marvellous facsimile edition, but I didn’t feel it wise to raise the subject, or to suggest the inclusion of drawings in the autobiography (which Mrs. Jaffé urged me to do). It really should form part, sometime, of his opus: just as the autobiography is an essential supplement to his other writings, so is the Red Book to the autobiography. The Red Book made a profound impression on me; there can be no doubt that Jung has gone through everything that an insane person goes through, and more. Talk of Freud’s self-analysis: Jung is a walking asylum in himself! The only difference between him and a regular inmate is his astounding capacity to stand off from the terrifying reality of his visions, to observe and understand what was happening, and to hammer out of his experience a system of therapy that works. But for this unique achievement he’d be as mad as a hatter. The raw material of his experience is Schreber’s world over again; only by his powers of observation and detachment, and his drive to understand, can it be said of him what Coleridge said in his Notebooks of a great metaphysician (and what a motto it would make for the autobiography!): He looked at his own Soul with Telescope / What seemed all irregular, he saw &amp; shewed to be beautiful Constellations &amp; he added to the Consciousness hidden worlds within worlds / ” (March 17, 1961, Bollingen archives, Library of Congress). The citation from Coleridge was indeed used as a motto for <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>.</p>

<p>Translators’ Note</p>
<p>MARK KYBURZ, JOHN PECK, AND SONU SHAMDASANI</p>
<p>At the outset of <em>Liber Novus,</em> Jung experiences a crisis of language. The spirit of the depths, who immediately challenges Jung’s use of language along with the spirit of the time, informs Jung that on the terrain of his soul his achieved language will no longer serve. His own powers of knowing and speaking can no longer account for why he utters what he says or under what compulsion he speaks. All such attempts become arbitrary in the depth realm, even murderous. He is made to understand that what he might say on these occasions is both “madness” and, instructively, what is.1 Indeed, in a broader perspective, the language that he will find for his inner experience would compose a vast Commedia: “Do you believe, man of this time, that laughter is lower than worship? Where is your measure, false measurer? The sum of life decides in laughter and in worship, not your judgment.”2</p>
<p>In translating this accumulated record of Jung’s imaginal encounters with his inner figures, from a sixteen-year period beginning just before the First World War, we have let Jung remain a man who was pulled loose from his moorings but also caught up in the maelstrom that has gone by the name of literary modernism. We have tried neither to further modernize nor to render more archaic the language and forms in which he couched his personal record.</p>
<p>The language in <em>Liber Novus</em> pursues three main stylistic registers, and each poses distinct difficulties for a translator. One of them faithfully reports the fantasies and inner dialogues of Jung’s imaginal encounters, while a second remains firmly and discerningly conceptual. Still a third writes in a mantic and prophetic, or Romantic and dithyrambic, mode. The relation between these reportorial, reflective, and Romantic aspects of Jung’s language remains comedic in a manner that Dante or Goethe would have recognized. That is, within each chapter the descriptive, conceptual, and mantic registers consistently rub against each other, while at the same time no single register is affected by its partners. All three stylistic registers serve psychic promptings, and each chapter shares a polyphonic mode with the others. In the <em>Scrutinies</em> section from 1917 this polyphony matures, its voices commingling in various ratios.</p>
<p>A reader will quickly infer that this design was not premeditated, but rather grew from the experiment to which Jung arduously submitted. The “Editorial Note” diagrams the textual evolution of this composition. Here we need only observe that Jung each time sets down an initial protocol layer of narrative encounter, usually with dialogue, and then, in the “second layer,” a lyrical elaboration of and commentary on that encounter. The first layer avoids an elevated tone, whereas the second welcomes elevation and modulates into sermonic, mantic-prophetic reflections on the episode’s meaning, which in turn unpack events discursively. This mode of composition—which is unique in Jung’s works—was no temperamental arrangement. Instead, as the episodes accumulated and their stakes mounted, it grew into an experiment that was as much literary as it was psychological and spiritual. In Jung’s extensive published and unpublished corpus, there is no other text that was subjected to such careful and continual linguistic revision as <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>These three linguistic registers already present themselves as virtual models for a possible translation. Our practice has been to let them cohabit within the exploratory frameworks alive in Jung’s own day. The task before him was to find a language rather than use one ready at hand. The mantic and conceptual registers can themselves be considered as translations of the descriptive register. That is, these registers move from a literal level to symbolic ones that amplify it, in a modern analogue to Dante’s “modi diversi” in his letter to Can Grande della Scala.3 In a very real sense, <em>Liber Novus</em> was composed through intertextual translation. The book’s rhetoric, its manner of address, emerges from this interanimating structure of internal translation or transvaluation. A critical task for any translation of the work, therefore, is conveying this compositional texture intact.</p>
<p>The fact that painted images of an accomplished and hybrid kind illuminate the medieval format of a folio in scribal hand compounds any reflections on the linguistic task. The novel language required a renewed ancient script. A polyphonic style couches itself multimedia fashion within a symbolic throwback-yet-forward movement, medieval and anticipatory, into retrievals of psychic reality. Verbal and visual images press in on Jung from the root past and present while aiming toward the beyond: a layered medium emerges, whose polyphonic style mirrors within its language that same composite layering.</p>
<p>Faced with the task of translating a text composed nearly a hundred years ago, translators usually have the benefit of prior models to consult, as well as decades of scholarly commentary and criticism. Without such exemplars at hand, we were left to imagine how the work might have been translated in previous decades. Consequently, our translation sidesteps several unpublished or hypothetical models for rendering <em>Liber Novus</em> into English. There is Peter Baynes’s strikingly archaizing <em>Septem Sermones</em> of 1925, which draws largely upon a Victorian idiom. Or the conceptually rationalizing version that R.F.C. Hull might have attempted had he been allowed to translate it alongside his other volumes in the Bollingen Series of Jung’s <em>Collected Works</em>;4 or the elegant literary rendering from the hand of someone like R. J. Hollingdale. Our version therefore occupies an actual position in a largely virtual sequence. Consideration of these virtual models highlighted questions of how to pitch the language within historical shifts in English prose, how to convey the myriad convergences and divergences between the language of <em>Liber Novus</em> and Jung’s <em>Collected Works</em>, and how to render in English a work simultaneously echoing Luther’s German and Nietzsche’s parody of the same in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>. Because our version takes this position, accordingly when we have cited Jung’s <em>Collected Works</em> we have freshly rendered or discreetly modified the published translations.</p>
<p><em>Liber Novus</em> was coeval with the literary ferment that Mikhail Bakhtin called the dialogical prose imagination.5 The Anglo-Welsh writer and artist David Jones, author of <em>In Parenthesis</em> and <em>The Anathemata</em>, referred to the rupture of the First World War, and its effects on the historical sense of writers, artists, and thinkers, simply as “The Break.”6 In concert with other experimental writing from these decades, <em>Liber Novus</em> excavates archaeological layers of literary adventure, with hard-won consciousness as both shovel and precious shard. While Jung actively considered publishing <em>Liber Novus</em> for many years, he chose not to make a name for himself in this literary manner—as much for style as for content—by releasing it. By 1921 with <em>Psychological Types</em> he already found that his sanctum could furnish him his main themes, through translation into a scholarly idiom.</p>
<p>Jung enunciates the tension among his three stylistic registers, already addressing a future readership—which shifts from an inner circle of friends to a wider public between different layers of the text. This is graphically apparent in the frequent pronomial shifts between the versions, which show the manner in which he was constantly reimagining the potential readers of the text. Jung coherently adopted this dialogical stance—polyphonic in Bakhtin’s later terms—once again mindful of a hypothetical future audience yet also aloof from the question of audience altogether, not from pride but simply in view of the aims to be served. Paintings and fantasies from this private treasury entered anonymously as crypted intertexts into Jung’s later work, nestling as hermetic clues to the undisclosed whole of his effort.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can imagine Jung laughing when he wrote of “3. Case Z” in the last section of his essay on “The Psychological Aspects of the Kore” (1941).7 There he summarizes as anonymous twelve episodes from encounters with his own soul in <em>Liber Novus</em>, calling them “a dream-series.” The comments he appends to these propel the adventurer he had been, and the subject he became in that adventure, into the discourse of a would-be science. The comedy is both spacious and exquisite: this respectful host to the anima also wields the diagnostic pointer in all seriousness. His language flexibly straddled both contexts, but also kept certain veils in place while doing so. This linguistic strategy mirrored Jung’s larger aims in remaining fruitfully dual and contextual. Declaring his mysteries to be particular, not to be aped in any way, he nonetheless also offered them as a template of formative spiritual process, and, in so doing, attempted to develop an idiom that could be taken up by others to articulate their experiences.</p>
<p>This is one way of paraphrasing the considerable anomaly of the language that Jung had to find through sleepless nights from 1913 onward. That language shifted its shape, altered its scale, and weighed both megrims and tons. Therefore it comes as no surprise that in his more elevated passages Jung relied on the resonance of the Luther Bible, itself a translation that had achieved rocklike stability within German culture. <em>Ein feste Burg</em>, “a mighty fortress:” thus our own reliance here on the King James Version of the Bible (KJV) for comparable tonalities in English. Yet a paradox rises immediately: what Jung counted on in that resonance had transplanted an alien spirit into the Germanic <em>Heimat</em> or home, as one may likewise say of the KJV’s deep embedding of the same implant in Anglo-Saxon culture. Franz Rosenzweig, translating parts of the Old Testament with Martin Buber in the mid-1920s, identified Luther’s Bible as the great space-maker within Germanic spirit, precisely through Luther’s close-in moves toward his source: “For the comfort of our souls, we must retain such words, must put up with them, and so give the Hebrew some room where it does better than German can.”8 Thus our own practice of not smoothing out Jung’s several modes, or making them run more fluently than need be, or even regularizing his punctuation. Think of Dante’s “shaggy” diction, or of still another maxim from Luther in Rosenzweig’s notes: “The mud will cling to the wheel.”9</p>
<p>Yet even these profound allowances for archaic and original speech across abysses of meaning fail to approximate the destabilizing experience, in and through language, to which Jung testifies. His later comments in the published memoir, on his reservations about high-flown style,10 in effect cover his tracks in <em>Liber Novus</em>. The original experience sent speech into a spin that animates the book’s initiatic dimension. Language too undergoes a descent into hell and the realm of the dead, which divests one of speech even as it renews the capacity for utterance.</p>
<p>The following instances give some idea of this factor’s range, mapping the stresses in any sincere ventriloquism such as Jung risked by undertaking a controlled séance with himself and his ground, with pen in hand. Hölderlin’s hair-breadth space warps and Isaiah’s tongue-borne burning coal both move in this league, along with Plato on “right frenzy” or divine madness: (1)” My soul spoke to me in a whisper, urgently and alarmingly: ‘Words, words, do not make too many words. Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness, and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are all completely mired in madness?’ ”11 (2) Jung’s soul: “There are hellish webs of words, only words . . . Be tentative with words, value them . . . for you are the first who gets snared in them. For words have meanings. With words you pull up the underworld. Word, the paltriest and the mightiest. In words the emptiness and the fullness flow together. Hence the word is an image of the God.”12 (3) “But if the word is a symbol, it means everything. When the way enters death and we are surrounded by rot and horror, the way rises in the darkness and leaves the mouth as the saving symbol, the word.”13 (4) The dead woman: “Let me have the word—oh, that you cannot hear! How difficult—give me the word!”14 It then materializes in Jung’s hand as HAP, the phallus. (5) Jung’s soul: “You possess the word that should not be allowed to remain concealed.”15 (6) Jung: “What is my word? It is the stammering of a minor . . .” Soul: “They do not see the fire, they do not believe your words, but they see your mark and unknowingly suspect you to be the messenger of the burning agony . . . You stutter, you stammer.”16 In the protocols for his memoir, Jung recalls bringing to the original experiences in <em>Liber Novus</em> only a “highly clumsy speech.”17 Yet one instance (7) strongly belies that later emphasis: “I knew that Philemon had intoxicated me and given me a language that was foreign to me and of a different sensitivity. All of this faded when the God arose and only Philemon kept that language.”18</p>
<p>This last instance indicates that Jung later attributed the mantic, dithyrambic speech of layer two in everything before the <em>Scrutinies</em> section to Philemon. The literal intoxication described here is linguistic, a dramatized, ventriloquial version of Platonic divine madness. It therefore underscores our attempt to faithfully render the stylistic registers of <em>Liber Novus</em> so as to present a vital aspect of Jung’s literary experiment, as he grapples with attempting to find the most fitting idiom in which to cast the transformations of inner experience. Jung’s search for the soul, then, stands at one with the search for appropriately dialogical and differentiated language.</p>
<p>These instances in all their oscillations affect a reading of Jung’s <em>Collected Works</em>, and counsel caution with applying its conceptual tools to the task of reading and understanding <em>Liber Novus</em>. To take but one example, one begins to see that it is too neat to equate the opposed yet related depths of Logos and Eros with the conceptual and lyrical-mantic registers found in <em>Liber Novus</em>. Jung’s “Commentary” on the Elijah-Salome relationship included here shows that relationship to be developmental, a mystery play of “the formative process” that kindles love for the lowest in us.19 The modal span for language in <em>Liber Novus</em> thus animates that mystery play but does not correspond directly to opposed psychological functions.</p>
<p>This complex respect for language instructs translators of <em>Liber Novus</em> in navigating the underworld/redemptive tensions spanned by its rhetoric. The great force behind the mantic tension in that rhetoric occupied Jung in the brief Epilogue he inscribed in the calligraphic volume in 1959, two years before his death. Once again plying the seas of those illuminated pages, he seems to have found any further summing-up to be unnecessary. Breaking off in midsentence, he left the book to stand on its own, as one strand of discourse within his whole effort. That counterpoint required no comment, any more than did the three registers of language within the book itself. Ordeal was Commedia after all, calling for no retrospective theoretical justification. <em>Liber Novus</em> would survive the gropings and peltings of reception. Jung had remarked in 1957 to Aniela Jaffé that so much rubbish had been said about him that any more rubbish didn’t disturb him.20 That lifted pen therefore confidently consigned the book to its depth trajectory, steeply expanding into the quarry it had become, with both his <em>Collected Works</em> and the lakeside tower at Bollingen as its final extractions.</p>
<p>In this note we have attempted to convey only the general principles that have guided this translation. A full discussion of the choices that confronted us and a justification of the decisions taken would fill a volume as ample as this one.</p>

<p>Editorial Note</p>
<p>SONU SHAMDASANI</p>
<p><em>Liber Novus</em> is an unfinished manuscript corpus, and it is not completely clear how Jung intended to complete it, or how he would have published it, had he decided to do so. We have a series of manuscripts, of which no single version can be taken as final. Consequently, the text could be presented in a variety of ways. This note indicates the editorial rationale behind the present edition.</p>
<p>The following is the sequence of extant manuscripts for <em>Liber Primus</em> and <em>Liber Secundus</em>:</p>
<p><em>Black Books 2–5</em> (November 1913–April 1914)<br>
<em>Handwritten Draft</em> (Summer 1914–1915)<br>
<em>Typed Draft</em> (circa 1915)<br>
<em>Corrected Draft</em> (with one layer of changes circa 1915; one layer of changes circa mid-1920s)<br>
<em>Calligraphic Volume</em> (1915–1930, resumed in 1959, left incomplete)<br>
<em>Cary Baynes’s transcription</em> (1924–1925)<br>
<em>Yale Manuscript. Liber Primus</em>, minus the prologue (identical with <em>Typed Draft</em>)<br>
<em>Copy-Edited Draft of Liber Primus</em> minus the prologue, with corrections in unknown hands (circa late 1950s; edited version of the <em>Typed Draft</em>)</p>
<p>For <em>Scrutinies</em>, we have:</p>
<p><em>Black Books 5–6</em> (April 1914–June 1916)<br>
<em>Calligraphic Septem Sermones</em> (1916)<br>
<em>Printed Septem Sermones</em> (1916)<br>
<em>Handwritten Draft</em> (circa 1917)<br>
<em>Typed Draft</em> (circa 1918)<br>
<em>Cary Baynes’s transcription</em> (1925) (27 pages, incomplete)</p>
<p>The arrangement presented here starts with a revision of Cary Baynes’s transcription and a fresh transcription of the remaining material in the calligraphic volume together with the <em>Typed Draft of Scrutinies</em>, with line-by-line comparisons with all extant versions. The last thirty pages are completed from the <em>Draft</em>. The main variations between the different manuscripts concern the “second layer” of the text. These changes represent Jung’s continued work of comprehending the psychological significance of the fantasies. As Jung considered <em>Liber Novus</em> to be an “attempt at an elaboration in terms of the revelation,” the changes between the different versions present this “attempt at an elaboration,” and therefore are an important part of the work itself. Thus the notes indicate significant changes between the different versions, and they present material that clarifies the meaning or context of a particular section. Each manuscript layer is important and interesting, and a publication of all of them—which would run to several thousand pages—would be a task for the future.1</p>
<p>The criterion for including passages from the earlier manuscripts has been simply the question: does this inclusion help the reader comprehend what is taking place? Aside from the intrinsic importance of these changes, noting them in the footnotes serves a second purpose—it shows how carefully Jung worked at continually revising the text.</p>
<p>The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has two layers of corrections by Jung. The first set of corrections appears to have been done after the <em>Draft</em> was typed and before the transcription into the calligraphic volume, as it appears that it was this manuscript that Jung transcribed.2 A further set of corrections on approximately 200 pages of the typescript appears to have been made <em>after</em> the calligraphic volume, and I would estimate that these were done sometime in the mid-1920s. These corrections modernize the language, and bring the terminology into relation with Jung’s terminology from the period of <em>Psychological Types</em>. Additional clarifications are also added. Jung even corrected material in the <em>Draft</em> that was deleted in the calligraphic volume. I have presented some of the significant changes in the footnotes. From them, it is possible for a reader to see how Jung would have revised the whole text, had he completed this layer of corrections.</p>
<p>Subdivisions have been added in <em>Liber Secundus</em>, chapter 21, “The Magician,” and in <em>Scrutinies</em> for ease of reference. These are indicated by numbers in scrolled brackets: { }. Where possible, the date of each fantasy has been given from the <em>Black Books</em>. The second layer added in the draft is indicated by [2], and the manuscript reverts to the sequence of the fantasies in the <em>Black Books</em> at the beginning of the following chapter. In the passages where subdivisions have been added, the reversion to the sequence of the <em>Black Books</em> is indicated by [1].</p>
<p>The various manuscripts have different systems of paragraphing. In the <em>Draft</em>, paragraphs often consist of one or two sentences, and the text is presented like a prose poem. At the other extreme, in the calligraphic volume, there are lengthy passages of text with no paragraph breaks. The most logical paragraphing appears in Cary Baynes’s transcription. She frequently took her cue for paragraph breaks from the presence of colored initials. Because it is unlikely that she would have reparagraphed the text without Jung’s approval, her layout has formed the point of departure for this edition. In some instances, the paragraphing has been brought closer into line with the <em>Draft</em> and the calligraphic volume. In the second half of her transcription, Cary Baynes transcribed the <em>Draft</em>, because the calligraphic volume had not been completed. Here, I have paragraphed the text in the same manner as established before. I believe that this presents the text in the clearest and easiest-to-follow form.</p>
<p>In the calligraphic volume, Jung illustrated certain initials and wrote some in red and blue, and sometimes increased the size of the text. The layout here attempts to follow these conventions. Because the initials in question aren’t always the same in English and German, the choice of which initial to set in red in the English has been governed by its corresponding location in the text. The bolding and increase of font size has been rendered by italics. The remainder of the text beyond that which Jung transcribed in the calligraphic volume has been set following the same conventions, to maintain consistency. In the case of the <em>Septem Sermones</em>, the font coloring has followed Jung’s printed version of 1916.</p>
<p>The decision to include <em>Scrutinies</em> in sequence with and as part of <em>Liber Novus</em> is based on the following editorial rationale: The material in the <em>Black Books</em> commences in November 1913. <em>Liber Secundus</em> closes with material from April 19, 1914, and <em>Scrutinies</em> commences with material from the same day. The <em>Black Books</em> run consecutively until July 21, 1914, and recommence on June 3, 1915. In the hiatus, Jung wrote the <em>Handwritten Draft</em>. When Cary Baynes transcribed <em>Liber Novus</em> between 1924 and 1925, the first half of her transcription followed <em>Liber Novus</em> itself to the point reached by Jung in his own transcription into the calligraphic volume. It continues by following the draft, and then proceeds 27 pages into <em>Scrutinies</em>, ending midsentence.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>Liber Secundus</em>, Jung’s soul has ascended to Heaven following the reborn God. Jung now thinks that Philemon is a charlatan, and comes to his “I,” whom he must live with and educate. <em>Scrutinies</em> continues directly from this point with a confrontation with his “I.” The ascent of the reborn God is referred to, and his soul returns and explains why she had disappeared. Philemon reappears, and instructs Jung on how to establish the right relation to his soul, the dead, the Gods, and the daimons. In <em>Scrutinies</em> Philemon fully emerges and takes on the significance that Jung attached to him both in the 1925 seminar and in <em>Memories</em>. Only in <em>Scrutinies</em> do certain episodes in <em>Liber Primus</em> and <em>Liber Secundus</em> become clear. By the same token, the narrative in <em>Scrutinies</em> makes no sense if one has not read <em>Liber Primus</em> and <em>Liber Secundus</em>.</p>
<p>At two places in <em>Scrutinies</em>, <em>Liber Primus</em> and <em>Liber Secundus</em> are mentioned in a way that strongly suggests that they are all part of the same work:</p>
<p>And then the War broke out. This opened my eyes about what I had experienced before and it also gave me the courage to say all that I have written in the earlier part of this book.3</p>
<p>Since the God has ascended to the upper realms, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ has also become different. He first appeared to me as a magician who lived in a distant land, but then I felt his nearness and, since the God has ascended, I knew that ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had intoxicated me and given me a language that was foreign to me and of a different sensitivity. All of this faded when the God arose and only ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ kept that language. But I felt that he went on other ways than I did. Probably the greater part of what I have written in the earlier part of this book was given to me by ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ.4</p>
<p>These references to the “earlier part of this book” suggest that all of this indeed constitutes one book, and that <em>Scrutinies</em> was considered by Jung to be part of <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>This view is supported by the number of internal connections between the texts. One example is the fact that the mandalas in <em>Liber Novus</em> are closely connected to the experience of the self and the realization of its centrality depicted only in <em>Scrutinies</em>. Another example occurs in <em>Liber Secundus</em>, chapter 15; when Ezechiel and his fellow Anabaptists arrive, they tell Jung that they are going to Jerusalem’s holy places because they are not at peace, not having fully finished with life. In <em>Scrutinies</em>, the dead reappear, telling Jung that they have been to Jerusalem, but did not find what they sought there. At that point, Philemon appears and the <em>Septem Sermones</em> begin. Perhaps Jung intended to transcribe <em>Scrutinies</em> into the calligraphic volume and illustrate it; there are ample blank pages.</p>
<p>On January 8, 1958, Cary Baynes asked Jung: “Do you remember that you had me copy quite a bit of the Red Book itself while you were in Africa? I got as far as the beginning of the <em>Prüfungen [Scrutinies]</em>. This goes beyond what Frau Jaffé put at K. W.’s [Kurt Wolff] disposal and he would like to read it. Is that OK?”5 Jung replied on January 24, “I have no objections against your lending your notes of the ‘Red Book’ to Mr. Wolff.”6 Here Cary Baynes, too, seems to have regarded <em>Scrutinies</em> as part of <em>Liber Novus</em>.</p>
<p>In citations in the notes, ellipses have been indicated by three periods. No emphases have been added.</p>

<p>Note to the Reader’s Edition</p>
<p>Since the publication of the original edition of this work, which included a facsimile reproduction of the calligraphic pages on a one to one scale, there has been a clamor for a more portable reader’s edition as a complement to facilitate close study of the work. Judging by Jung’s privately printed edition of the <em>Septem Sermones ad Mortuous</em>, a text-only edition would likely have been one of the forms of publication that he contemplated at some stage. This edition reproduces the complete translation, introduction, and notes of the original edition of the work, now laid out in one column, similar to the format of Jung’s handwritten manuscript and typescript. Cross-references in the text to the facsimile plates have been retained, to enable readers to quickly find the corresponding location and images, when read alongside the original edition. Aside from a few corrections, the text is unchanged. References to Jung’s 1925 seminar have been updated to the revised edition of 2012.</p>

<p>[Isaiah said: Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. (Isaiah 53: 1–4)]2</p>

Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.

<p><em>manu propria scriptum a C. G. Jung anno Domini mcmxv in domu sua Kusnach Turicense</em></p>
<p>[Written by C. G. Jung with his own hand in his house in Küsnacht/Zürich in the year 1915.]</p>
<p>fol. i(r)/i(v) [HI i(v)] [2] If I speak in the spirit of this time,5 I must say: no one and nothing can justify what I must proclaim to you. Justification is superfluous to me, since I have no choice, but I must. I have learned that in addition to the spirit of this time there is still another spirit at work, namely that which rules the depths of everything contemporary.6 The spirit of this time would like to hear of use and value. I also thought this way, and my humanity still thinks this way. But that other spirit forces me nevertheless to speak, beyond justification, use, and meaning. Filled with human pride and blinded by the presumptuous spirit of the times, I long sought to hold that other spirit away from me. But I did not consider that the spirit of the depths from time immemorial and for all the future possesses a greater power than the spirit of this time, who changes with the generations. The spirit of the depths has subjugated all pride and arrogance to the power of judgment. He took away my belief in science, he robbed me of the joy of explaining and ordering things, and he let devotion to the ideals of this time die out in me. He forced me down to the last and simplest things.</p>
<p>The spirit of the depths took my understanding and all my knowledge and placed them at the service of the inexplicable and the paradoxical. He robbed me of speech and writing for everything that was not in his service, namely the melting together of sense and nonsense, which produces the supreme meaning.</p>
<p>*But the supreme meaning is the path, the way and the bridge to what is to come. That is the God yet to come. It is not the coming God himself, but his image which appears in the supreme meaning.*7 <em>God is an image, and those who worship him must worship him in the image of the supreme meaning.</em></p>
<p><em>The supreme meaning is not a meaning and not an absurdity, it is image and force in one, magnificence and force together.</em></p>
<p>*The supreme meaning is the beginning and the end. It is the bridge of going across and fulfillment.*8</p>
<p><em>The other Gods died of their temporality, yet the supreme meaning never dies, it turns into meaning and then into absurdity, and out of the fire and blood of their collision the supreme meaning rises up rejuvenated anew.</em></p>
<p><em>The image of God has a shadow. The supreme meaning is real and casts a shadow. For what can be actual and corporeal and have no shadow?</em></p>
<p><em>The shadow is nonsense. It lacks force and has no continued existence through itself. But nonsense is the inseparable and undying brother of the supreme meaning.</em></p>
<p><em>Like plants, so men also grow, some in the light, others in the shadows. There are many who need the shadows and not the light.</em></p>
<p><em>The image of God throws a shadow that is just as great as itself.</em></p>
<p><em>The supreme meaning is great and small, it is as wide as the space of the starry Heaven and as narrow as the cell of the living body.</em></p>
<p>The spirit of this time in me wanted to recognize the greatness and extent of the supreme meaning, but not its littleness. The spirit of the depths, however, conquered this arrogance, and I had to swallow the small as a means of healing the immortal in me. It completely burnt up my innards since it was inglorious and unheroic. It was even ridiculous and revolting. But the pliers of the spirit of the depths held me, and I had to drink the bitterest of all draughts.9</p>
<p>The spirit of this time tempted me with the thought that all this belongs to the shadowiness of the God-image. This would be pernicious deception, since the shadow is nonsense. But the small, narrow, and banal is not nonsense, but one of both of the essences of the Godhead.</p>
<p>I resisted recognizing that the everyday belongs to the image of the Godhead. I fled this thought, I hid myself behind the highest and coldest stars.</p>
<p>But the spirit of the depths caught up with me, and forced the bitter drink between my lips.10</p>
<p>The spirit of this time whispered to me: “This supreme meaning, this image of God, this melting together of the hot and the cold, that is you and only you.” But the spirit of the depths spoke to me: “11 You are an image of the unending world, all the last mysteries of becoming and passing away live in you. If you did not possess all this, how could you know?”</p>
<p>For the sake of my human weakness, the spirit of the depths gave me this word. Yet this word is also superfluous, since I do not speak it freely, but because I must. I speak because the spirit robs me of joy and life if I do not speak.12 I am the serf who brings it and does not know what he carries in his hand. It would burn his hands if he did not place it where his master orders him to lay it.</p>
<p>The spirit of our time spoke to me and said: “What dire urgency could be forcing you to speak all this?” This was an awful temptation. I wanted to ponder what inner or outer bind could force me into this, and because I found nothing that I could grasp, I was near to making one up. But with this the spirit of our time had almost brought it about that instead of speaking, I was thinking again about reasons and explanations. But the spirit of the depths spoke to me and said: “To understand a thing is a bridge and possibility of returning to the path. But to explain a matter is arbitrary and sometimes even murder. Have you counted the murderers among the scholars?”</p>
<p>But the spirit of this time stepped up to me and laid before me huge volumes which contained all my knowledge. Their pages were made of ore, and a steel stylus had engraved inexorable words in them, and he pointed to these inexorable words and spoke to me, and said: “What you speak, that is madness.”</p>
<p>It is true, it is true, what I speak is the greatness and intoxication and ugliness of madness.</p>
<p>But the spirit of the depths stepped up to me and said: “What you speak is. The greatness is, the intoxication is, the undignified, sick, paltry dailiness is. It runs in all the streets, lives in all the houses, and rules the day of all humanity. Even the eternal stars are commonplace. It is the great mistress and the one essence of God. One laughs about it, and laughter, too, is. Do you believe, man of this time, that laughter is lower than worship? Where is your measure, false measurer?13 The sum of life decides in laughter and in worship, not your judgment.”</p>
<p>I must also speak the ridiculous. You coming men! You will recognize the supreme meaning by the fact that he is laughter and worship, a bloody laughter and a bloody worship. A sacrificial blood binds the poles. Those who know this laugh and worship in the same breath.</p>
<p>After this, however, my humanity approached me and said: “What solitude, what coldness of desolation you lay upon me when you speak such! Reflect on the destruction of being and the streams of blood from the terrible sacrifice that the depths demand.”14</p>
<p>But the spirit of the depths said: “No one can or should halt sacrifice. Sacrifice is not destruction, sacrifice is the foundation stone of what is to come. Have you not had monasteries? Have not countless thousands gone into the desert? You should carry the monastery in yourself. The desert is within you. The desert calls you and draws you back, and if you were fettered to the world of this time with iron, the call of the desert would break all chains. Truly, I prepare you for solitude.”</p>
<p>After this, my humanity remained silent. Something happened to my spirit, however, which I must call mercy.</p>
<p>My speech is imperfect. Not because I want to shine with words, but out of the impossibility of finding those words, I speak in images. With nothing else can I express the words from the depths.</p>
<p>The mercy which happened to me gave me belief, hope, and sufficient daring, not to resist further the spirit of the depths, but to utter his word. But before I could pull myself together to really do it, I needed a visible sign that would show me that the spirit of the depths in me was at the same time the ruler of the depths of world affairs.</p>
<p>15It happened in October of the year 1913 as I was leaving alone for a journey, that during the day I was suddenly overcome in broad daylight by a vision: I saw a terrible flood that covered all the northern and low-lying lands between the North Sea and the Alps. It reached from England up to Russia, and from the coast of the North Sea right up to the Alps. I saw yellow waves, swimming rubble, and the death of countless thousands.</p>
<p>This vision lasted for two hours, it confused me and made me ill. I was not able to interpret it. Two weeks passed then the vision returned, still more violent than before, and an inner voice spoke: “Look at it, it is completely real, and it will come to pass. You cannot doubt this.” I wrestled again for two hours with this vision, but it held me fast. It left me exhausted and confused. And I thought my mind had gone crazy.16</p>
<p>From then on the anxiety toward the terrible event that stood directly before us kept coming back. Once I also saw a sea of blood over the northern lands.</p>
<p>In the year 1914 in the month of June, at the beginning and end of the month, and at the beginning of July, I had the same dream three times: I was in a foreign land, and suddenly, overnight and right in the middle of summer, a terrible cold descended from space. All seas and rivers were locked in ice, every green living thing had frozen.</p>
<p>The second dream was thoroughly similar to this. But the third dream at the beginning of July went as follows:</p>
<p>I was in a remote English land.17 It was necessary that I return to my homeland with a fast ship as speedily as possible.18 I reached home quickly.19 In my homeland I found that in the middle of summer a terrible cold had fallen from space, which had turned every living thing into ice. There stood a leaf-bearing but fruitless tree, whose leaves had turned into sweet grapes full of healing juice through the working of the frost.20 I picked some grapes and gave them to a great waiting throng.21</p>
<p>In reality, now, it was so: At the time when the great war broke out between the peoples of Europe, I found myself in Scotland,22 compelled by the war to choose the fastest ship and the shortest route home. I encountered the colossal cold that froze everything, I met up with the flood, the sea of blood, and found my barren tree whose leaves the frost had transformed into a remedy. And I plucked the ripe fruit and gave it to you and I do not know what I poured out for you, what bitter-sweet intoxicating drink, which left on your tongues an aftertaste of blood.</p>
<p>Believe me:23 <em>It is no teaching and no instruction that I give you. On what basis should I presume to teach you? I give you news of the way of</em> this <em>man, but not of your own way. My path is not your path, therefore I</em> fol. i(v)/ii(r) *cannot teach you.*24 <em>The way is within us, but not in Gods, nor in teachings, nor in laws. Within us is the way, the truth, and the life.</em></p>
<p>*Woe betide those who live by way of examples! Life is not with them. If you live according to an example, you thus live the life of that example, but who should live your own life if not yourself? So live yourselves.*25</p>
<p>*The signposts have fallen, unblazed trails lie before us.*26 <em>Do not be greedy to gobble up the fruits of foreign fields. Do you not know that you yourselves are the fertile acre which bears everything that avails you?</em></p>
<p><em>Yet who today knows this? Who knows the way to the eternally fruitful climes of the soul? You seek the way through mere appearances, you study books and give ear to all kinds of opinion. What good is all that?</em></p>
<p>*There is only one way and that is your way.*27</p>
<p><em>You seek the path? I warn you away from my own. It can also be the wrong way for you.</em></p>
<p><em>May each go his own way.</em></p>
<p>*I will be no savior, no lawgiver, no master teacher unto you. You are no longer little children.*28</p>
<p><em>Giving laws, bettering, making things easier, has all become wrong and evil. May each one seek out his own way. The way leads to mutual love in community. Men will come to see and feel the similarity and commonality of their ways.</em></p>
<p><em>Laws and teachings held in common compel people to solitude, so that they may escape the pressure of undesirable contact, but solitude makes people hostile and venomous.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore give people dignity and let each of them stand apart, so that each may find his own fellowship and love it.</em></p>
<p><em>Power stands against power, contempt against contempt, love against love. Give humanity dignity, and trust that life will find the better way.</em></p>
<p>*The one eye of the Godhead is blind, the one ear of the Godhead is deaf, the order of its being is crossed by chaos. So be patient with the crippledness of the world and do not overvalue its consummate beauty.*29</p>
<p>Refinding the Soul</p>
<p>[HI ii(r)]30</p>
<p>Cap i.31</p>
<p>[2] When I had the vision of the flood in October of the year 1913, it happened at a time that was significant for me as a man. At that time, in the fortieth year of my life, I had achieved everything that I had wished for myself. I had achieved honor, power, wealth, knowledge, and every human happiness. Then my desire for the increase of these trappings ceased, the desire ebbed from me and horror came over me.32 The vision of the flood seized me and I felt the spirit of the depths, but I did not understand him.33 Yet he drove me on with unbearable inner longing and I said:</p>
<p>[1]34 “My soul, where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call you—are you there? I have returned, I am here again. I have shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I have come to you, I am with you. After long years of long wandering, I have come to you again. Should I tell you everything I have seen, experienced, and drunk in? Or do you not want to hear about all the noise of life and the world? But one thing you must know: the one thing I have learned is that one must live this life.</p>
<p>This life is the way, the long sought-after way to the unfathomable, which we call divine.35 There is no other way, all other ways are false paths. I found the right way, it led me to you, to my soul. I return, tempered and purified. Do you still know me? How long the separation lasted! Everything has become so different. And how did I find you? How strange my journey was! What words should I use to tell you on what twisted paths a good star has guided me to you? Give me your hand, my almost forgotten soul. How warm the joy at seeing you again, you long disavowed soul. Life has led me back to you. Let us thank the life I have lived for all the happy and all the sad hours, for every joy, for every sadness. My soul, my journey should continue with you. I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude.”36</p>
<p>[2] The spirit of the depths forced me to say this and at the same time to undergo it against myself, since I had not expected it then. I still labored misguidedly under the spirit of this time, and thought differently about the human soul. I thought and spoke much of the soul. I knew many learnèd words for her, I had judged her and turned her into a scientific object.37 I did not consider that my soul cannot be the object of my judgment and knowledge; much more are my judgment and knowledge the objects of my soul.38 Therefore the spirit of the depths forced me to speak to my soul, to call upon her as a living and self-existing being. I had to become aware that I had lost my soul.</p>
<p>From this we learn how the spirit of the depths considers the soul: he sees her as a living and self-existing being, and with this he contradicts the spirit of this time for whom the soul is a thing dependent on man, which lets herself be judged and arranged, and whose circumference we can grasp. I had to accept that what I had previously called my soul was not at all my soul, but a dead system.39 Hence I had to speak to my soul as to something far off and unknown, which did not exist through me, but through whom I existed.</p>
<p>He whose desire turns away from outer things, reaches the place of the soul.40 If he does not find the soul, the horror of emptiness will overcome him, and fear will drive him with a whip lashing time and again in a desperate endeavor and a blind desire for the hollow things of the world. He becomes a fool through his endless desire, and forgets the way of his soul, never to find her again. He will run after all things, and will seize hold of them, but he will not find his soul, since he would find her only in himself. Truly his soul lies in things and men, but the blind one seizes things and men, yet not his soul in things and men. He has no knowledge of his soul. How could he tell her apart from things and men? He could find his soul in desire itself, but not in the objects of desire. If he possessed his desire, and his desire did not possess him, he would lay a hand on his soul, since his desire is the image and expression of his soul.41</p>
<p>If we possess the image of a thing, we possess half the thing.</p>
<p>The image of the world is half the world. He who possesses the world but not its image possesses only half the world, since his soul is poor and has nothing. The wealth of the soul exists in images.42 He who possesses the image of the world, possesses half the world, even if his humanity is poor and owns nothing.43 But hunger makes the soul into a beast that devours the unbearable and is poisoned by it. My friends, it is wise to nourish the soul, otherwise you will breed dragons and devils in your heart.44</p>
<p>Soul and God</p>
<p>[HI ii(r)2]45</p>
<p>Cap. ii.</p>
<p>On the second night I called out to my soul:46</p>
<p>“I am weary, my soul, my wandering has lasted too long, my search for myself outside of myself. Now I have gone through events and find you behind all of them. For I made discoveries on my erring through events, humanity, and the world. I found men. And you, my soul, I found again, first in images within men and then you yourself. I found you where I least expected you. You climbed out of a dark shaft. You announced yourself to me in advance in dreams.47 They burned in my heart and drove me to all the boldest acts of daring, and forced me to rise above myself. You let me see truths of which I had no previous inkling. You let me undertake journeys, whose endless length would have scared me, if the knowledge of them had not been secure in you.</p>
<p>I wandered for many years, so long that I forgot that I possessed a soul.48 Where were you all this time? Which Beyond sheltered you and gave you sanctuary? Oh, that you must speak through me, that my speech and I are your symbol and expression! How should I decipher you?</p>
<p>Who are you, child? My dreams have represented you as a child and as a maiden.49 I am ignorant of your mystery.50 Forgive me if I speak as in a dream, like a drunkard—are you God? Is God a child, a maiden?51 Forgive me if I babble. No one else hears me. I speak to you quietly, and you know that I am neither a drunkard nor someone deranged, and that my heart twists in pain from the wound, whose darkness delivers speeches full of mockery: “You are lying to yourself! You spoke so as to deceive others and make them believe in you. You want to be a prophet and chase after your ambition.” The wound still bleeds, and I am far from being able to pretend that I do not hear the mockery.</p>
<p>How strange it sounds to me to call you a child, you who still hold the all-without-end in your hand.52 I went on the way of the day, and you went invisibly with me, putting the pieces together meaningfully, and letting me see the whole in each part.</p>
<p>You took away where I thought to take hold, and you gave me where I did not expect anything and time and again you brought about fate from new and unexpected quarters. Where I sowed, you robbed me of the harvest, and where I did not sow, you give me fruit a hundredfold. And time and again I lost the path and found it again where I would never have foreseen it. You upheld my belief, when I was alone and near despair. At every decisive moment you let me believe in myself.”</p>
<p>[2] Like a tired wanderer who had sought nothing in the world apart from her, shall I come closer to my soul. I shall learn that my soul finally lies behind everything, and if I cross the world, I am ultimately doing this to find my soul. Even the dearest are themselves not the goal and end of the love that goes on seeking, they are symbols of their own souls.</p>
<p>My friends, do you guess to what solitude we ascend?</p>
<p>I must learn that the dregs of my thought, my dreams, are the speech of my soul. I must carry them in my heart, and go back and forth over them in my mind, like the words of the person dearest to me. Dreams are the guiding words of the soul. Why should I henceforth not love my dreams and not make their riddling images into objects of my daily consideration? You think that the dream is foolish and ungainly. What is beautiful? What is ungainly? What is clever? What is foolish? The spirit of this time is your measure, but the spirit of the depths surpasses it at both ends. Only the spirit of this time knows the difference between large and small. But this difference is invalid, like the spirit which recognizes it. fol. ii(r)/ii(v)</p>
<p>The spirit of the depths even taught me to consider my action and my decision as dependent on dreams. Dreams pave the way for life, and they determine you without you understanding their language.53 One would like to learn this language, but who can teach and learn it? Scholarliness alone is not enough; there is a knowledge of the heart that gives deeper insight.54 The knowledge of the heart is in no book and is not to be found in the mouth of any teacher, but grows out of you like the green seed from the dark earth. Scholarliness belongs to the spirit of this time, but this spirit in no way grasps the dream, since the soul is everywhere that scholarly knowledge is not.</p>
<p>But how can I attain the knowledge of the heart? You can attain this knowledge only by living your life to the full. You live your life fully if you also live what you have never yet lived, but have left for others to live or to think.55 You will say: “But I cannot live or think everything that others live or think.” But you should say: “The life that I could still live, I should live, and the thoughts that I could still think, I should think.” It appears as though you want to flee from yourself so as not to have to live what remains unlived until now.56 But you cannot flee from yourself. It is with you all the time and demands fulfillment. If you pretend to be blind and dumb to this demand, you feign being blind and deaf to yourself. This way you will never reach the knowledge of the heart.</p>
<p>The knowledge of your heart is how your heart is.</p>
<p>From a cunning heart you will know cunning.</p>
<p>From a good heart you will know goodness.</p>
<p>So that your understanding becomes perfect, consider that your heart is both good and evil. You ask, “What? Should I also live evil?”</p>
<p>The spirit of the depths demands: “The life that you could still live, you should live. Well-being decides, not your well-being, not the well-being of the others, but only well-being.”</p>
<p>Well-being is between me and others, in society. I, too, lived—which I had not done before, and which I could still do. I lived into the depths, and the depths began to speak. The depths taught me the other truth. It thus united sense and nonsense in me.</p>
<p>I had to recognize that I am only the expression and symbol of the soul. In the sense of the spirit of the depths, I am as I am in this visible world a symbol of my soul, and I am thoroughly a serf, completely subjugated, utterly obedient. The spirit of the depths taught me to say: “I am the servant of a child.” Through this dictum I learn above all the most extreme humility, as what I most need.</p>
<p>The spirit of this time of course allowed me to believe in my reason. He let me see myself in the image of a leader with ripe thoughts. But the spirit of the depths teaches me that I am a servant, in fact the servant of a child. This dictum was repugnant to me and I hated it. But I had to recognize and accept that my soul is a child and that my God in my soul is a child.57</p>
<p><em>If you are boys, your God is a woman.</em></p>
<p><em>If you are women, your God is a boy.</em></p>
<p><em>If you are men, your God is a maiden.</em></p>
<p><em>The God is where you are not.</em></p>
<p><em>So: it is wise that one has a God; this serves for your perfection.</em></p>
<p><em>A maiden is the pregnant future.</em></p>
<p><em>A boy is the engendering future.</em></p>
<p><em>A woman is: having given birth.</em></p>
<p><em>A man is: having engendered.</em></p>
<p><em>So: if you are childlike beings now, your God will descend from the height of ripeness to age and death.</em></p>
<p><em>But if you are developed beings, having engendered or given birth, in body or in soul, so your God rises from the radiant cradle, to the incalculable height of the future, to the maturity and fullness of the coming time.</em></p>
<p><em>He who still has his life before him is a child.</em></p>
<p><em>He who lives life in the present is developed.</em></p>
<p><em>If you thus live all that you can live, you are developed.</em></p>
<p><em>He who is a child in this time, his God dies.</em></p>
<p><em>He who is developed in this time, his God continues to live.</em></p>
<p><em>The spirit of the depths teaches this mystery.</em></p>
<p><em>Prosperous and woeful are those whose God is developed!</em></p>
<p><em>Prosperous and woeful are those whose God is a child!</em></p>
<p><em>What is better, that man has life ahead of him, or that God does?</em></p>
<p><em>I know no answer. Live; the unavoidable decides.</em></p>
<p>*The spirit of the depths taught me that my life is encompassed by the divine child.*58 <em>From his hand everything unexpected came to me, everything living.</em></p>
<p>*This child is what I feel as an eternally springing youth in me.*59</p>
<p><em>In childish men you feel the hopeless transience. All that you saw passing is yet to come for him. His future is full of transience.</em></p>
<p><em>But the transience of the things coming toward you has never yet experienced a human meaning.</em></p>
<p><em>Your continuing to live is a living onward. You engender and give birth to what is to come, you are fecund, you live onward.</em></p>
<p>*The childish is unfruitful, what is to come to him is what already has been engendered and already withered. It does not live onward.*60</p>
<p>My God is a child, so wonder not that the spirit of this time in me is incensed to mockery and scorn. There will be no one who will laugh at me as I laughed at myself.</p>
<p>Your God should not be a man of mockery, rather you yourself will be the man of mockery. You should mock yourself and rise above this. If you have still not learned this from the old holy books, then go there, drink the blood and eat the flesh of him who was mocked61 and tormented for the sake of our sins, so that you totally become his nature, deny his being-apart-from-you; you should be he himself, not Christians but Christ, otherwise you will be of no use to the coming God.</p>
<p>Is there any one among you who believes he can be spared the way? Can he swindle his way past the pain of Christ? I say: “Such a one deceives himself to his own detriment. He beds down on thorns and fire. No one can be spared the way of Christ, since this way leads to what is to come. You should all become Christs.62</p>
<p>You do not overcome the old teaching through doing less, but through doing more. Every step closer to my soul excites the scornful laughter of my devils, those cowardly ear-whisperers and poison-mixers. It was easy for them to laugh, since I had to do strange things.</p>
<p>On the Service of the Soul</p>
<p>[HI ii(v)]</p>
<p>Cap. iii.</p>
<p>63On the following night I had to write down all the dreams that I could recollect, true to their wording.64 The meaning of this act was dark to me. Why all this? Forgive the fuss that rises in me. Yet you want me to do this. What strange things are happening to me? I know too much not to see on what swaying bridges I go. Where are you leading me? Forgive my excessive apprehension, brimful of knowledge. My foot hesitates to follow you. Into what mist and darkness does your path lead? Must I also learn to do without meaning? If this is what you demand, then so be it. This hour belongs to you. What is there, where there is no meaning? Only nonsense, or madness, it seems to me. Is there also a supreme meaning? Is that your meaning, my soul? I limp after you on crutches of understanding. I am a man and you stride like a God. What torture! I must return to myself, to my smallest things. I saw the things of my soul as small, pitiably small. You force me to see them as large, to make them large. Is that your aim? I follow, but it terrifies me. Hear my doubts, otherwise I cannot follow, since your meaning is a supreme meaning, and your steps are the steps of a God.</p>
<p>I understand, I must not think either; should thought, too, no longer be? I should give myself completely into your hands—but who are you? I do not trust you. Not once to trust, is that my love for you, my joy in you? Do I not trust every valiant man, and not you, my soul? Your hand lies heavy on me, but I will, I will. Have I not sought to love men and trust them, and should I not do this with you? Forget my doubts, I know it is ignoble to doubt you. You know how difficult it is for me to set aside the beggar’s pride I take in my own thought. I forgot that you are also one of my friends, and have the first right to my trust. Should what I give them not belong to you? I recognize my injustice. It seems to me that I despised you. My joy at finding you again was not genuine. I also recognize that the scornful laughter in me was right.</p>
<p>I must learn to love you.65 Should I also set aside self-judgment? I am afraid. Then the soul spoke to me and said: “This fear testifies against me!” It is true, it testifies against you. It kills the holy trust between you and me.</p>
<p>[2] <em>How hard is fate! If you take a step toward your soul, you will at first miss the meaning. You will believe that you have sunk into meaninglessness, into eternal disorder. You will be right! Nothing will deliver you from disorder and meaninglessness, since this is the other half of the world.</em></p>
<p><em>Your God is a child, so long as you are not childlike. Is the child order, meaning? Or disorder, caprice? Disorder and meaninglessness are the mother of order and meaning. Order and meaning are things that have become and are no longer becoming.</em></p>
<p><em>You open the gates of the soul to let the dark flood of chaos flow into your order and meaning. If you marry the ordered to the chaos you produce the divine child, the supreme meaning beyond meaning and meaninglessness.</em></p>
<p>*You are afraid to open the door? I too was afraid, since we had forgotten that God is terrible. Christ taught: God is love.*66 <em>But you should know that love is also terrible.</em></p>
<p><em>I spoke to a loving soul and as I drew nearer to her, I was overcome by horror, and I heaped up a wall of doubt, and did not anticipate that I thus wanted to protect myself from my fearful soul.</em></p>
<p><em>You dread the depths; it should horrify you, since the way of what is to come leads through it. You must endure the temptation of fear and doubt, and at the same time acknowledge to the bone that your fear is justified and your doubt is reasonable. How otherwise</em> fol. ii(v)/iii(r) <em>could it be a true temptation and a true overcoming?</em></p>
<p>*Christ totally overcomes the temptation of the devil, but not the temptation of God to good and reason.*67 *Christ thus succumbs to cursing.*68</p>
<p><em>You still have to learn this, to succumb to no temptation, but to do everything of your own will; then you will be free and beyond Christianity.</em></p>
<p>*I have had to recognize that I must submit to what I fear; yes, even more, that I must even love what horrifies me. We must learn such from that saint who was disgusted by the plague infections; she drank the pus of plague boils and became aware that it smelled like roses. The acts of the saint were not in vain.*69</p>
<p>*In everything regarding your salvation and the attainment of mercy, you are dependent on your soul. Thus no sacrifice can be too great for you. If your virtues hinder you from salvation, discard them, since they have become evil to you. The slave to virtue finds the way as little as the slave to vices.*70</p>
<p><em>If you believe that you are the master of your soul, then become her servant. If you were her servant, make yourself her master, since she needs to be ruled. These should be your first steps.</em></p>
<p>During six further nights, the spirit of the depths was silent in me, since I swayed between fear, defiance, and nausea, and was wholly the prey of my passion. I could not and did not want to listen to the depths. But on the seventh night, the spirit of the depths spoke to me: “Look into your depths, pray to your depths, waken the dead.”71</p>
<p>But I stood helpless and did not know what I could do. I looked into myself, and the only thing I found within was the memory of earlier dreams, all of which I wrote down without knowing what good this would do. I wanted to throw everything away and return to the light of day. But the spirit stopped me and forced me back into myself.</p>
<p>The Desert</p>
<p>[HI iii(r)]</p>
<p>Cap. iv.</p>
<p>72Sixth night. My soul leads me into the desert, into the desert of my own self. I did not think that my soul is a desert, a barren, hot desert, dusty and without drink. The journey leads through hot sand, slowly wading without a visible goal to hope for? How eerie is this wasteland. It seems to me that the way leads so far away from mankind. I take my way step by step, and do not know how long my journey will last.</p>
<p>Why is my self a desert? Have I lived too much outside of myself in men and events? Why did I avoid my self? Was I not dear to myself? But I have avoided the place of my soul. I was my thoughts, after I was no longer events and other men. But I was not my self, confronted with my thoughts. I should also rise up above my thoughts to my own self. My journey goes there, and that is why it leads away from men and events into solitude. Is it solitude, to be with oneself? Solitude is true only when the self is a desert.73 Should I also make a garden out of the desert? Should I people a desolate land? Should I open the airy magic garden of the wilderness? What leads me into the desert, and what am I to do there? Is it a deception that I can no longer trust my thoughts? Only life is true, and only life leads me into the desert, truly not my thinking, that would like to return to thoughts, to men and events, since it feels uncanny in the desert. My soul, what am I to do here? But my soul spoke to me and said, “Wait.” I heard the cruel word. Torment belongs to the desert.74</p>
<p>I also had to detach myself from my thoughts through turning my desire away from them. And at once, I noticed that my self became a desert, where only the sun of unquiet desire burned. I was overwhelmed by the endless infertility of this desert. Even if something could have thrived there, the creative power of desire was still absent. Wherever the creative power of desire is, there springs the soil’s own seed. But do not forget to wait. Did you not see that when your creative force turned to the world, how the dead things moved under it and through it, how they grew and prospered, and how your thoughts flowed in rich rivers? If your creative force now turns to the place of the soul, you will see how your soul becomes green and how its field bears wonderful fruit.</p>
<p>[2]Through giving my soul all I could give, I came to the place of the soul and found that this place was a hot desert, desolate and unfruitful. No culture of the mind is enough to make a garden out of your soul. I had cultivated my spirit, the spirit of this time in me, but not that spirit of the depths that turns to the things of the soul, the world of the soul. The soul has its own peculiar world. Only the self enters in there, or the man who has completely become his self, he who is neither in events, nor in men, nor in his thoughts. Through the turning of my desire from things and men, I turned my self away from things and men, but that is precisely how I became the secure prey of my thoughts, yes, I wholly became my thoughts.</p>
<p>Nobody can spare themselves the waiting and most will be unable to bear this torment, but will throw themselves with greed back at men, things, and thoughts, whose slaves they will become from then on. Since then it will have been clearly proved that this man is incapable of enduring beyond things, men, and thoughts, and they will hence become his master and he will become their fool, since he cannot be without them, not until even his soul has become a fruitful field. Also he whose soul is a garden, needs things, men, and thoughts, but he is their friend and not their slave and fool.</p>
<p>Everything to come was already in images: to find their soul, the ancients went into the desert.75 This is an image. The ancients lived their symbols, since the world had not yet become real for them. Thus they went into the solitude of the desert to teach us that the place of the soul is a lonely desert. There they found the abundance of visions, the fruits of the desert, the wondrous flowers of the soul. Think diligently about the images that the ancients have left behind. They show the way of what is to come. Look back at the collapse of empires, of growth and death, of the desert and monasteries, they are the images of what is to come. Everything has been foretold. But who knows how to interpret it?</p>
<p>When you say that the place of the soul is not, then it is not. But if you say that it is, then it is. Notice what the ancients said in images: the word is a creative act. The ancients said: in the beginning was the Word.76 Consider this and think upon it.</p>
<p>The words that oscillate between nonsense and supreme meaning are the oldest and truest.</p>
<p>Experiences in the Desert</p>
<p>[HI iii(r) 2]</p>
<p>77After a hard struggle I have come a piece of the way nearer to you. How hard this struggle was! I had fallen into an undergrowth of doubt, confusion, and scorn. I recognize that I must be alone with my soul. I come with empty hands to you, my soul. What do you want to hear? But my soul spoke to me and said, “If you come to a friend, do you come to take?” I knew that this should not be so, but it seems to me that I am poor and empty. I would like to sit down near you and at least feel the breath of your animating presence. My way is hot sand. All day long, sandy, dusty paths. My patience is sometimes weak, and once I despaired of myself, as you know.</p>
<p>My soul answered and said, “You speak to me as if you were a child complaining to its mother. I am not your mother.” I do not want to complain, but let me say to you that mine is a long and dusty road. You are to me like a shady tree in the wilderness. I would like to enjoy your shade. But my soul answered, “You are pleasure-seeking. Where is your patience? Your time has not yet run its course. Have you forgotten why you went into the desert?”</p>
<p>My faith is weak, my face is blind from all that shimmering blaze of the desert sun. The heat lies on me like lead. Thirst torments me, I dare not think how unendingly long my way is, and above all, I see nothing in front of me. But the soul answered, “You speak as if you have still learned nothing. Can you not wait? Should everything fall into your lap ripe and finished? You are full, yes, you teem with intentions and desirousness!—Do you still not know that the way to truth stands open only to those without intentions?”</p>
<p>I know that everything you say, Oh my soul, is also my thought. But I hardly live according to it. The soul said, “How, tell me, do you then believe that your thoughts should help you?” I would always like to refer to the fact that I am a human being, just a human being who is weak and sometimes does not do his best. But the soul said, “Is this what you think it means to be human?” You are hard, my soul, but you are right. How little we still commit ourselves to living. We should grow like a tree that likewise does not know its law. We tie ourselves up with intentions, not mindful of the fact that intention is the limitation, yes, the exclusion of life. We believe that we can illuminate the darkness with an intention, and in that way aim past the light.78 How can we presume to want to know in advance, from where the light will come to us?</p>
<p>Let me bring only one complaint before you: I suffer from scorn, my own scorn. But my soul said to me, “Do you think little of yourself?” I do not believe so. My soul answered, “Then listen, do you think little of me? Do you still not know that you are not writing a book to feed your vanity, but that you are speaking with me? How can you suffer from scorn if you address me with those words that I give you? Do you know, then, who I am? Have you grasped me, defined me, and made me into a dead formula? Have you measured the depths of my chasms, and explored all the ways down which I am yet going to lead you? Scorn cannot challenge you if you are not vain to the marrow of your bones.” Your truth is hard. I want to lay down my vanity before you, since it blinds me. See, that is why I also believed my hands were empty when I came to you today. I did not consider that it is you who fills empty hands if only they want to stretch out, yet they do not want to. I did not know that I am your vessel, empty without you but brimming over with you.</p>
<p>[2] This was my twenty-fifth night in the desert. This is how long it took my soul to awaken from a shadowy being to her own life, until she could approach me as a free-standing being separate from me. And I received hard but salutary words from her. I needed that taking in hand, since I could not overcome the scorn within me.</p>
<p><em>The spirit of this time considers itself extremely clever, like every such spirit of the time. But wisdom is simpleminded, not just simple. Because of this, the clever person mocks wisdom, since mockery is his weapon. He uses the pointed, poisonous weapon, because he is struck by naive wisdom. If he were not struck, he would not need the weapon. Only in the desert do we become aware of our terrible simplemindedness, but we are afraid of admitting it. “That is why we are scornful. But mockery</em> fol. iii(r)/iii(v) <em>does not attain simplemindedness. The mockery falls on the mocker, and in the desert where no one hears and answers, he suffocates from his own scorn.</em></p>
<p>*The cleverer you are, the more foolish your simplemindedness. The totally clever are total fools in their simplemindedness. We cannot save ourselves from the cleverness of the spirit of this time through increasing our cleverness, but through accepting what our cleverness hates most, namely simplemindedness. Yet we also do not want to be artificial fools because we have fallen into simplemindedness, rather we will be clever fools. That leads to the supreme meaning. Cleverness couples itself with intention. Simplemindedness knows no intention. Cleverness conquers the world, but simplemindedness, the soul. So take on the vow of poverty of spirit in order to partake of the soul.*79</p>
<p>*Against this the scorn of my cleverness rose up.*80 <em>Many will laugh at my foolishness. But no one will laugh more than I laughed at myself.</em></p>
<p><em>So I overcame scorn. But when I had overcome it, I was near to my soul, and she could speak to me, and I was soon to see the desert becoming green.</em></p>
<p>Descent into Hell in the Future</p>
<p>[HI iii(v)]</p>
<p>Cap. v.</p>
<p>81In the following night, the air was filled with many voices. A loud voice called, “I am falling.” Others cried out confused and excited during this: “Where to? What do you want?” Should I entrust myself to this confusion? I shuddered. It is a dreadful deep. Do you want me to leave myself to chance, to the madness of my own darkness? Whither? Whither? You fall, and I want to fall with you, whoever you are.</p>
<p>The spirit of the depths opened my eyes and I caught a glimpse of the inner things, the world of my soul, the many-formed and changing. [Image iii(v) 1]</p>
<p>I see a gray rock face along which I sink into great depths.82 I stand in black dirt up to my ankles in a dark cave. Shadows sweep over me. I am seized by fear, but I know I must go in. I crawl through a narrow crack in the rock and reach an inner cave whose bottom is covered with black water. But beyond this I catch a glimpse of a luminous red stone which I must reach. I wade through the muddy water. The cave is full of the frightful noise of shrieking voices.83 I take the stone, it covers a dark opening in the rock. I hold the stone in my hand, peering around inquiringly. I do not want to listen to the voices, they keep me away.84 But I want to know. Here something wants to be uttered. I place my ear to the opening. I hear the flow of underground waters. I see the bloody head of a man on the dark stream. Someone wounded, someone slain floats there. I take in this image for a long time, shuddering. I see a large black scarab floating past on the dark stream.</p>
<p>In the deepest reach of the stream shines a red sun, radiating through the dark water. There I see—and a terror seizes me—small serpents on the dark rock walls, striving toward the depths, where the sun shines. A thousand serpents crowd around, veiling the sun. Deep night falls. A red stream of blood, thick red blood springs up, surging for a long time, then ebbing. I am seized by fear. What did I see?85 [Image iii(v) 2]</p>
<p>Heal the wounds that doubt inflicts on me, my soul. That too is to be overcome, so that I can recognize your supreme meaning. How far away everything is, and how I have turned back! My spirit is a spirit of torment, it tears asunder my contemplation, it would dismantle everything and rip it apart. I am still a victim of my thinking. When can I order my thinking to be quiet, so that my thoughts, those unruly hounds, will crawl to my feet? How can I ever hope to hear your voice louder, to see your face clearer, when all my thoughts howl?</p>
<p>I am stunned, but I want to be stunned, since I have sworn to you, my soul, to trust you even if you lead me through madness. How shall I ever walk under your sun if I do not drink the bitter draught of slumber to the lees? Help me so that I do not choke on my own knowledge. The fullness of my knowledge threatens to fall in on me. My knowledge has a thousand voices, an army roaring like lions; the air trembles when they speak, and I am their defenseless sacrifice. Keep it far from me, science that clever knower,86 that bad prison master who binds the soul and imprisons it in a lightless cell. But above all protect me from the serpent of judgment, which only appears to be a healing serpent, yet in your depths is infernal poison and agonizing death. I want to go down cleansed into your depths with white garments and not rush in like some thief, seizing whatever I can and fleeing breathlessly. Let me persist in divine87 astonishment, so that I am ready to behold your wonders. Let me lay my head on a stone before your door, so that I am prepared to receive your light.</p>
<p>[2] When the desert begins to bloom, it brings forth strange plants. You will consider yourself mad, and in a certain sense you will in fact be mad.88 To the extent that the Christianity of this time lacks madness, it lacks divine life. Take note of what the ancients taught us in images: madness is divine.89 But because the ancients lived this image concretely in events, it became a deception for us, since we became masters of the reality of the world. It is unquestionable: if you enter into the world of the soul, you are like a madman, and a doctor would consider you to be sick. What I say here can be seen as sickness, but no one can see it as sickness more than I do.</p>
<p>This is how I overcame madness. If you do not know what divine madness is, suspend judgment and wait for the fruits.90 But know that there is a divine madness which is nothing other than the overpowering of the spirit of this time through the spirit of the depths. Speak then of sick delusion when the spirit of the depths can no longer stay down and forces a man to speak in tongues instead of in human speech, and makes him believe that he himself is the spirit of the depths. But also speak of sick delusion when the spirit of this time does not leave a man and forces him to see only the surface, to deny the spirit of the depths and to take himself for the spirit of the times. The spirit of this time is ungodly, the spirit of the depths is ungodly, balance is godly.</p>
<p>Because I was caught up in the spirit of this time, precisely what happened to me on this night had to happen to me, namely that the spirit of the depths erupted with force, and swept away the spirit of this time with a powerful wave. But the spirit of the depths had gained this power, because I had spoken to my soul during 25 nights in the desert and I had given her all my love and submission. But during the 25 days, I gave all my love and submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only at night.</p>
<p>Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one and does without the other you may call sick since he is out of balance.</p>
<p>But who can withstand fear when the divine intoxication and madness comes to him? Love, soul, and God are beautiful and terrible. The ancients brought over some of the beauty of God into this world, and this world became so beautiful that it appeared to the spirit of the time to be fulfillment, and better than the bosom of the Godhead. The frightfulness and cruelty of the world lay under wraps and in the depths of our hearts. If the spirit of the depths seizes you, you will feel the cruelty and cry out in torment. The spirit of the depths is pregnant with iron, fire, and death. You are right to fear the spirit of the depths, as he is full of horror.</p>
<p>You see in these days what the spirit of the depths bore. You did not believe it, but you would have known it if you had taken counsel with your fear.91</p>
<p>Blood shone at me from the red light of the crystal, and when I picked it up to discover its mystery, there lay the horror uncovered before me: in the depths of what is to come lay murder. The blond hero lay slain. The black beetle is the death that is necessary for renewal; and so thereafter, a new sun glowed, the sun of the depths, full of riddles, a sun of the night. And as the rising sun of spring quickens the dead earth, so the sun of the depths quickened the dead, and thus began the terrible struggle between light and darkness. Out of that burst the powerful and ever unvanquished source of blood. This was what was to come, which you now experience in your life, and it is even more than that. (I had this vision on the night of 12 December 1913.)</p>
<p>Depths and surface should mix so that new life can develop. Yet the new life does not develop outside of us, but within us. What happens outside us in these days is the image that the peoples live in events, to bequeath this image immemorially to far-off times so that they might learn from it for their own way, just as we learned from the images that the ancients had lived before us in events.</p>
<p>Life does not come from events, but from us. Everything that happens outside has already been.</p>
<p><em>Therefore whoever considers the event from outside always sees only that it already was, and that it is always the same. But whoever looks from inside, knows that everything is new. The events that happen are always the same. But the creative depths of man are not always the same. Events signify nothing, they signify only in us. We create the meaning of events. The meaning is and always was artificial. We make it.</em></p>
<p><em>Because of this we seek in ourselves the meaning of events, so that the way of</em> fol. iii(v)/iv(r) <em>what is to come becomes apparent and our life can flow again.</em></p>
<p><em>That which you need comes from yourself, namely the meaning of the event. The meaning of events is not their particular meaning. This meaning exists in learnèd books. Events have no meaning.</em></p>
<p><em>The meaning of events is the way of salvation that you create. The meaning of events comes from the possibility of life in this world that you create. It is the mastery of this world and the assertion of your soul in this world.</em></p>
<p>*This meaning of events is the supreme meaning, that is not in events, and not in the soul, but is the God standing between events and the soul, the mediator of life, the way, the bridge and the going across.*92</p>
<p>I would not have been able to see what was to come if I could not have seen it in myself.</p>
<p>Therefore I take part in that murder; the sun of the depths also shines in me after the murder has been accomplished; the thousand serpents that want to devour the sun are also in me. I myself am a murderer and murdered, sacrificer and sacrificed.93 The upwelling blood streams out of me.</p>
<p>You all have a share in the murder.94 In you the reborn one will come to be, and the sun of the depths will rise, and a thousand serpents will develop from your dead matter and fall on the sun to choke it. Your blood will stream forth. The peoples demonstrate this at the present time in unforgettable acts, that will be written with blood in unforgettable books for eternal memory.95</p>
<p>But I ask you, when do men fall on their brothers with mighty weapons and bloody acts? They do such if they do not know that their brother is themselves. They themselves are sacrificers, but they mutually do the service of sacrifice. They must all sacrifice each other, since the time has not yet come when man puts the bloody knife into himself, in order to sacrifice the one he kills in his brother. But whom do people kill? They kill the noble, the brave, the heroes. They take aim at these and do not know that with these they mean themselves. They should sacrifice the hero in themselves, and because they do not know this, they kill their courageous brother.</p>
<p>The time is still not ripe. But through this blood sacrifice, it should ripen. So long as it is possible to murder the brother instead of oneself, the time is not ripe. Frightful things must happen until men grow ripe. But anything else will not ripen humanity. Hence all this that takes place in these days must also be, so that the renewal can come. Since the source of blood that follows the shrouding of the sun is also the source of the new life.96</p>
<p>As the fate of the peoples is represented to you in events, so will it happen in your heart. If the hero in you is slain, then the sun of the depths rises in you, glowing from afar, and from a dreadful place. But all the same, everything that up till now seemed to be dead in you will come to life, and will change into poisonous serpents that will cover the sun, and you will fall into night and confusion. Your blood also will stream from many wounds in this frightful struggle. Your shock and doubt will be great, but from such torment the new life will be born. Birth is blood and torment. Your darkness, which you did not suspect since it was dead, will come to life and you will feel the crush of total evil and the conflicts of life that still now lie buried in the matter of your body. But the serpents are dreadful evil thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>You thought you knew that abyss? Oh you clever people! It is another thing to experience it. Everything will happen to you. Think of all the frightful and devilish things that men have inflicted on their brothers. That should happen to you in your heart. Suffer it yourself through your own hand, and know that it is your own heinous and devilish hand that inflicts the suffering on you, but not your brother, who wrestles with his own devils.97</p>
<p>I would like you to see what the murdered hero means. Those nameless men who in our day have murdered a prince are blind prophets who demonstrate in events what then is valid only for the soul.98 Through the murder of princes we will learn that the prince in us, the hero, is threatened.99 Whether this should be seen as a good or a bad sign need not concern us. What is awful today is good in a hundred years, and in two hundred years is bad again. But we must recognize what is happening: there are nameless ones in you who threaten your prince, the hereditary ruler.</p>
<p>But our ruler is the spirit of this time, which rules and leads in us all. It is the general spirit in which we think and act today. He is of frightful power, since he has brought immeasurable good to this world and fascinated men with unbelievable pleasure. He is bejewelled with the most beautiful heroic virtue, and wants to drive men up to the brightest solar heights, in everlasting ascent.100</p>
<p>The hero wants to open up everything he can. But the nameless spirit of the depths evokes everything that man cannot. Incapacity prevents further ascent. Greater height requires greater virtue. We do not possess it. We must first create it by learning to live with our incapacity. We must give it life. For how else shall it develop into ability?</p>
<p>We cannot slay our incapacity and rise above it. But that is precisely what we wanted. Incapacity will overcome us and demand its share of life. Our ability will desert us, and we will believe, in the sense of the spirit of this time, that it is a loss. Yet it is no loss but a gain, not for outer trappings, however, but for inner capability.</p>
<p>The one who learns to live with his incapacity has learned a great deal. This will lead us to the valuation of the smallest things, and to wise limitation, which the greater height demands. If all heroism is erased, we fall back into the misery of humanity and into even worse. Our foundations will be caught up in excitement since our highest tension, which concerns what lies outside us, will stir them up. We will fall into the cesspool of our underworld, among the rubble of all the centuries in us.101</p>
<p>The heroic in you is the fact that you are ruled by the thought that this or that is good, that this or that performance is indispensable, this or that cause is objectionable, this or that goal must be attained in headlong striving work, this or that pleasure should be ruthlessly repressed at all costs. Consequently you sin against incapacity. But incapacity exists. No one should deny it, find fault with it, or shout it down.102</p>
<p>Splitting of the Spirit</p>
<p>[HI iv(r)]</p>
<p>Cap. vi.</p>
<p>But on the fourth night I cried, “To journey to Hell means to become Hell oneself.103 It is all frightfully muddled and interwoven. On this desert path there is not just glowing sand, but also horrible tangled invisible beings who live in the desert. I didn’t know this. The way is only apparently clear, the desert is only apparently empty. It seems inhabited by magical beings who murderously attach themselves to me and daimonically change my form. I have evidently taken on a completely monstrous form in which I can no longer recognize myself. It seems to me that I have become a monstrous animal form for which I have exchanged my humanity. This way is surrounded by hellish magic, invisible nooses have been thrown over me and ensnare me.”</p>
<p>But the spirit of the depths approached me and said, “Climb down into your depths, sink!”</p>
<p>But I was indignant at him and said, “How can I sink? I am unable to do this myself.”</p>
<p>Then the spirit spoke words to me that appeared ridiculous, and he said, “Sit yourself down, be calm.”</p>
<p>But I cried out indignantly: “How frightful, it sounds like nonsense, do you also demand this of me? You overthrew the mighty Gods who mean the most to us. My soul, where are you? Have I entrusted myself to a stupid animal, do I stagger like a drunkard to the grave, do I stammer stupidities like a lunatic? Is this your way, my soul? The blood boils in me and I would strangle you if I could seize you. You weave the thickest darknesses and I am like a madman caught in your net. But I yearn, teach me.”</p>
<p>But my soul spoke to me saying, “My path is light.”</p>
<p>Yet I indignantly answered, “Do you call light what we men call the worst darkness? Do you call day night?”</p>
<p>To this my soul spoke a word that roused my anger: “My light is not of this world.”</p>
<p>I cried, “I know of no other world.”</p>
<p>The soul answered, “Should it not exist because you know nothing of it?” I: “But our knowledge? Does our knowledge also not hold good for you? What is it going to be, if not knowledge? Where is security? Where is solid ground? Where is light? Your darkness is not only darker than night, but bottomless as well. If it’s not going to be knowledge, then perhaps it will do without speech and words too?”</p>
<p>My soul: “No words.”</p>
<p>I: “Forgive me, perhaps I’m hard of hearing, perhaps I misinterpret you, perhaps I ensnare myself in self-deceit and monkey business, and I am a rascal grinning at myself in a mirror, a fool in my own madhouse. Perhaps you stumble over my folly?”</p>
<p>My soul: “You delude yourself, you do not deceive me. Your words are lies to you, not me.”</p>
<p>I: “But could I wallow in raging nonsense, and hatch absurdity and perverse monotony?”</p>
<p>My soul: “Who gives you thoughts and words? Do you make them? Are you not my serf, a recipient who lies at my door and picks up my alms? And you dare think that what you devise and speak could be nonsense? Don’t you know yet that it comes from me and belongs to me?”</p>
<p>So I cried full of anger, “But then my indignation must also come from you, and in me you are indignant against yourself.” My soul then spoke the ambiguous words: “That is civil war.”104</p>
<p>I was afflicted with pain and rage, and I answered back, “How painful, my soul, to hear you use hollow words; I feel sick. Comedy and drivel—but I yearn. I can also crawl through mud and the most despised banality. I can also eat dust; that is part of Hell. I do not yield, I am defiant. You can go on devising torments, spider-legged monsters, ridiculous, hideous, frightful theatrical spectacles. Come close, I am ready. Ready, my soul, you who are a devil, to wrestle with you too. You donned the mask of a God, and I worshiped you. Now you wear the mask of a devil, a frightful one, the mask of the banal, of eternal mediocrity! Only one favor! Give me a moment to step back and consider! Is the struggle with this mask worthwhile? Was the mask of God worth worshiping? I cannot do it, the lust for battle burns in my limbs. No, I cannot leave the battlefield defeated. I want to seize you, crush you, monkey, buffoon. Woe if the struggle is unequal, my hands grab at air. But your blows are also air, and I perceive trickery.”</p>
<p>I find myself again on the desert path. It was a desert vision, a vision of the solitary who has wandered down long roads. There lurk invisible robbers and assassins and shooters of poison darts. Suppose the murderous arrow is sticking in my heart?</p>
<p>[2] As the first vision had predicted to me, the assassin appeared from the depths, and came to me just as in the fate of the peoples of this time a nameless one appeared and leveled the murder weapon at the prince.105</p>
<p>I felt myself transformed into a rapacious beast. My heart glowered in rage against the high and beloved, against my prince and hero, just as the nameless one of the people, driven by greed for murder, lunged at his dear prince. Because I carried the murder in me, I foresaw it.106</p>
<p>Because I carried the war in me, I foresaw it. I felt betrayed and lied to by my king. Why did I feel this way? He was not as I had wished him to be. He was other than I expected. He should be the king in my sense, not in his sense. He should be what I called ideal. My soul appeared to me hollow, tasteless and meaningless. But in reality what I thought of her was valid for my ideal.</p>
<p>It was a fol. iv(r)/iv(v) vision of the desert, I struggled with mirror images of myself. It was civil war in me. I myself was the murderer and the murdered. The deadly arrow was stuck in my heart, and I did not know what it meant. My thoughts were murder and the fear of death, which spread like poison everywhere in my body.</p>
<p>And thus was the fate of the people: The murder of one was the poisonous arrow that flew into the hearts of men, and kindled the fiercest war. This murder is the indignation of incapacity against will, a Judas betrayal that one would like someone else to have committed.107 We are still seeking the goat that should bear our sin.108</p>
<p>*Everything that becomes too old becomes evil, the same is true of your highest. Learn from the suffering of the crucified God that one can also betray and crucify a God, namely the God of the old year. If a God ceases being the way of life, he must fall secretly.*109</p>
<p>*The God becomes sick if he oversteps the height of the zenith. That is why the spirit of the depths took me when the spirit of this time had led me to the summit.*110</p>
<p>Murder of the Hero</p>
<p>[HI iv(v)]111</p>
<p>Cap. vii.</p>
<p>On the following night, however, I had a vision:112 I was with a youth in high mountains. It was before daybreak, the Eastern sky was already light. Then Siegfried’s horn resounded over the mountains with a jubilant sound.113 We knew that our mortal enemy was coming. We were armed and lurked beside a narrow rocky path to murder him. Then we saw him coming high across the mountains on a chariot made of the bones of the dead. He drove boldly and magnificently over the steep rocks and arrived at the narrow path where we waited in hiding. As he came around the turn ahead of us, we fired at the same time and he fell slain. Thereupon I turned to flee, and a terrible rain swept down. But after this114 I went through a torment unto death and I felt certain that I must kill myself, if I could not solve the riddle of the murder of the hero.115</p>
<p>Then the spirit of the depths came to me and spoke these words:</p>
<p>“The highest truth is one and the same with the absurd.” This statement saved me, and like rain after a long hot spell, it swept away everything in me which was too highly tensed.</p>
<p>Then I had a second vision:116 I saw a merry garden, in which forms walked clad in white silk, all covered in colored light, some reddish, the others blueish and greenish.117 [Image iv(v)]</p>
<p>I know, I have stridden across the depths. Through guilt I have become a newborn.118</p>
<p>[2] We also live in our dreams, we do not live only by day. Sometimes we accomplish our greatest deeds in dreams.119</p>
<p>In that night my life was threatened since I had to kill my lord and God, not in single combat, since who among mortals could kill a God in a duel? You can reach your God only as an assassin,120 if you want to overcome him.</p>
<p>But this is the bitterest for mortal men: our Gods want to be overcome, since they require renewal. If men kill their princes, they do so because they cannot kill their Gods, and because they do not know that they should kill their Gods in themselves.</p>
<p><em>If the God grows old, he becomes shadow, nonsense, and he goes down. The greatest truth becomes the greatest lie, the brightest day becomes darkest night.</em></p>
<p><em>As day requires night and night requires day, so meaning requires absurdity and absurdity requires meaning.</em></p>
<p><em>Day does not exist through itself, night does not exist through itself.</em></p>
<p><em>The reality that exists through itself is day and night.</em></p>
<p><em>So the reality is meaning and absurdity.</em></p>
<p><em>Noon is a moment, midnight is a moment, morning comes from night, evening turns into night, but evening comes from the day and morning turns into day.</em></p>
<p>So meaning is a moment and a transition from absurdity to absurdity, and absurdity only a moment and a transition from meaning to meaning.121</p>
<p>Oh that Siegfried, blond and blue-eyed, the German hero, had to fall by my hand, the most loyal and courageous! He had everything in himself that I treasured as the greater and more beautiful; he was my power, my boldness, my pride. I would have gone under in the same battle, and so only assassination was left to me. If I wanted to go on living, it could only be through trickery and cunning.</p>
<p>Judge not! Think of the blond savage of the German forests, who had to betray the hammer-brandishing thunder to the pale Near-Eastern God who was nailed to the wood like a chicken marten. The courageous were overcome by a certain contempt for themselves. But their life force bade them to go on living, and they betrayed their beautiful wild Gods, their holy trees and their awe of the German forests.122</p>
<p>What does Siegfried mean for the Germans! What does it tell us that the Germans suffer Siegfried’s death! That is why I almost preferred to kill myself in order to spare him. But I wanted to go on living with a new God.123</p>
<p>After death on the cross Christ went into the underworld and became Hell. So he took on the form of the Antichrist, the dragon. The image of the Antichrist, which has come down to us from the ancients, announces the new God, whose coming the ancients had foreseen.</p>
<p>Gods are unavoidable. The more you flee from the God, the more surely you fall into his hand.</p>
<p>The rain is the great stream of tears that will come over the peoples, the tearful flood of released tension after the constriction of death had encumbered the peoples with horrific force. It is the mourning of the dead in me, which precedes burial and rebirth. The rain is the fructifying of the earth, it begets the new wheat, the young, germinating God.124</p>
<p>The Conception of the God</p>
<p>[HI iv(v) 2]</p>
<p>Cap. viii.</p>
<p>On the second night thereafter, I spoke to my soul and said, “This new world appears weak and artificial to me. Artificial is a bad word, but the mustard seed that grew into a tree, the word that was conceived in the womb of a virgin, became a God to whom the earth was subject.”125</p>
<p>As I spoke thus, the spirit of the depths suddenly erupted. He filled me with intoxication and mist and spoke these words with a powerful voice: [OB iv (v)] <em>“I have received your sprout, you who are to come!</em></p>
<p><em>I have received it in deepest need and lowliness.</em></p>
<p><em>I covered it in shabby patchwork and bedded down on poor words.</em></p>
<p><em>And mockery worshiped it, your child, your wondrous child, the child of one who is to come, who should announce the father, a fruit that is older than the tree on which it grew.</em></p>
<p><em>In pain will you conceive and joyful is your birth.</em></p>
<p><em>Fear is your herald, doubt stands to your right, disappointment to your left.</em></p>
<p><em>We passed by in our ridiculousness and senselessness when we caught sight of you.</em></p>
<p><em>Our eyes were blinded and our knowledge fell silent when we received your radiance.</em></p>
<p><em>You new spark of an eternal fire, into which night were you born?</em></p>
<p><em>You will wring truthful prayers from your believers, and they must speak of your glory in tongues that are atrocious to them.</em></p>
<p>*You will come over them in the hour of their disgrace, and will become known to them in what they hate, fear, and abhor.*126</p>
<p><em>Your voice, the rarest pleasing sound, will be heard amid the stammerings of wretches, rejects, and those condemned as worthless.</em></p>
<p><em>Your realm will be touched by the hands of those who also worshiped before the most profound lowliness, and whose longing drove them through the mud tide of evil.</em></p>
<p><em>You will give your gifts to those who pray to you in terror and doubt, and your light will shine upon those whose knees must bend before you unwillingly and who are filled with resentment.</em></p>
<p><em>Your life is with he who has overcome himself</em> fol. iv(v)/v(r) [OB v(r)] *and who has disowned his self-overcoming.*127</p>
<p>*I also know that the salvation of mercy is given only to those who believe in the highest and faithlessly betray themselves for thirty pieces of silver.*128</p>
<p><em>Those who will dirty their pure hands and cheat on their best knowledge against error and take their virtues from a murderer’s grave are invited to your great banquet.</em></p>
<p><em>The constellation of your birth is an ill and changing star.</em></p>
<p><em>These, Oh child of what is to come, are the wonders that will bear testimony that you are a veritable God.”</em></p>
<p>[2] When my prince had fallen, the spirit of the depths opened my vision and let me become aware of the birth of the new God.</p>
<p>The divine child approached me out of the terrible ambiguity, the hateful-beautiful, the evil-good, the laughable-serious, the sick-healthy, the inhuman-human and the ungodly-godly.129</p>
<p>I understood that the God130 whom we seek in the absolute was not to be found in absolute beauty, goodness, seriousness, elevation, humanity or even in godliness. Once the God was there.</p>
<p>I understood that the new God would be in the relative. If the God is absolute beauty and goodness, how should he encompass the fullness of life, which is beautiful and hateful, good and evil, laughable and serious, human and inhuman? How can man live in the womb of the God if the Godhead himself attends only to one-half of him?131</p>
<p>If we have risen near the heights of good and evil, then our badness and hatefulness lie in the most extreme torment. Man’s torment is so great and the air of the heights so weak that he can hardly live anymore. The good and the beautiful freeze to the ice of the absolute idea,132 and the bad and hateful become mud puddles full of crazy life.</p>
<p>Therefore after his death Christ had to journey to Hell, otherwise the ascent to Heaven would have become impossible for him. Christ first had to become his Antichrist, his underworldly brother.</p>
<p>No one knows what happened during the three days Christ was in Hell. I have experienced it.133 The men of yore said that he had preached there to the deceased.134 What they say is true, but do you know how this happened?</p>
<p>It was folly and monkey business, an atrocious Hell’s masquerade of the holiest mysteries. How else could Christ have saved his Antichrist? Read the unknown books of the ancients, and you will learn much from them. Notice that Christ did not remain in Hell, but rose to the heights in the beyond.135</p>
<p>Our conviction of the value of the good and beautiful has become strong and unshakable, that is why life can extend beyond this and still fulfil everything that lay bound and yearning. But the bound and yearning is also the hateful and bad. Are you again indignant about the hateful and the bad?</p>
<p>Through this you can recognize how great are their force and value for life. Do you think that it is dead in you? But this dead can also change into serpents.136 These serpents will extinguish the prince of your days.</p>
<p>Do you see what beauty and joy came over men when the depths unleashed this greatest war? And yet it was a frightful beginning.137</p>
<p>If we do not have the depths, how do we have the heights? Yet you fear the depths, and do not want to confess that you are afraid of them. It is good, though, that you fear yourselves; say it out loud that you are afraid of yourselves. It is wisdom to fear oneself. Only the heroes say that they are fearless. But you know what happens to the hero.</p>
<p>With fear and trembling, looking around yourselves with mistrust, go thus into the depths, but do not do this alone; two or more is greater security since the depths are full of murder. Also secure yourselves the way of retreat. Go cautiously as if you were cowards, so that you pre-empt the soul murderers.138 The depths would like to devour you whole and choke you in mud.</p>
<p>He who journeys to Hell also becomes Hell; therefore do not forget from whence you come. The depths are stronger than us; so do not be heroes, be clever and drop the heroics, since nothing is more dangerous than to play the hero. The depths want to keep you; they have not returned very many up to now, and therefore men fled from the depths and attacked them.</p>
<p>What if the depths, due to the assault, now change themselves into death? But the depths indeed have changed themselves into death; therefore when they awoke they inflicted a thousandfold death.139 We cannot slay death, as we have already taken all life from it. If we still want to overcome death, then we must enliven it.</p>
<p>Therefore on your journey be sure to take golden cups full of the sweet drink of life, red wine, and give it to dead matter, so that it can win life back. The dead matter will change into black serpents. Do not be frightened, the serpents will immediately put out the sun of your days, and a night with wonderful will-o’-the-wisps will come over you.140</p>
<p>Take pains to waken the dead. Dig deep mines and throw in sacrificial gifts, so that they reach the dead. Reflect in good heart upon evil, this is the way to the ascent. But before the ascent, everything is night and Hell.</p>
<p>What do you think of the essence of Hell? Hell is when the depths come to you with all that you no longer are or are not yet capable of. Hell is when you can no longer attain what you could attain. Hell is when you must think and feel and do everything that you know you do not want. Hell is when you know that your having to is also a wanting to, and that you yourself are responsible for it. Hell is when you know that everything serious that you have planned with yourself is also laughable, that everything fine is also brutal, that everything good is also bad, that everything high is also low, and that everything pleasant is also shameful.</p>
<p>But the deepest Hell is when you realize that Hell is also no Hell, but a cheerful Heaven, not a Heaven in itself, but in this respect a Heaven, and in that respect a Hell.</p>
<p>That is the ambiguity of the God: he is born from a dark ambiguity and rises to a bright ambiguity. Unequivocalness is simplicity and leads to death.141 But ambiguity is the way of life.142 If the left foot does not move, then the right one does, and you move. The God wills this.143</p>
<p>You say: the Christian God is unequivocal, he is love.144 But what is more ambiguous than love? Love is the way of life, but your love is only on the way of life if you have a left and a right.</p>
<p>Nothing is easier than to play at ambiguity and nothing is more difficult than living ambiguity. He who plays is a child; his God is old and dies. He who lives is awakened; his God is young and goes on. He who plays hides from the inner death. He who lives feels the going onward and immortality. So leave the play to the players. Let fall what wants to fall; if you stop it, it will sweep you away. There is a true love that does not concern itself with neighbors.145</p>
<p>When the hero was slain and the meaning recognized in the absurdity, when all tension came rushing down from gravid clouds, when everything had become cowardly and looked to its own rescue, I became aware of the birth of the God.146 Opposing me, the God sank into my heart when I was confused by mockery and worship, by grief and laughter, by yes and no.</p>
<p>The one arose from the melting together of the two. He was born as a child from my own human soul, which had conceived him with resistance like a virgin. Thus it corresponds to the image that the ancients have given to us.147 But when the mother, my soul, was pregnant with the God, I did not know it. It even seemed to me as if my soul herself was the God, although he lived only in her body.148</p>
<p>And thus the image of the ancients is fulfilled: I pursued my soul to kill the child in it. For I am also the worst enemy of my God.149 But I also recognized that my enmity is decided upon in the God. He is mockery and hate and anger, since this is also a way of life.</p>
<p>I must say that the God could not come into being before the hero had been slain. The hero as we understand him has become an enemy of the God, since the hero is perfection. The Gods envy the perfection of man, because perfection has no need of the Gods. But since no one is perfect, we need the Gods. The Gods love perfection because it is the total way of life. But the Gods are not with him who wishes to be perfect, because he is an imitation of perfection.150</p>
<p>Imitation was a way of life when men still needed the heroic prototype.151 The monkey’s manner is a way of life for monkeys, and for man as long as he is like a monkey. Human apishness has lasted a terribly long time, but the time will come when a piece of that apishness will fall away from men.</p>
<p>That will be a time of salvation and the dove, and the eternal fire, and redemption will descend.</p>
<p>Then there will no longer be a hero, and no one who can imitate him. Because from that time henceforth all imitation is cursed. The new God laughs at imitation and discipleship. He needs no imitators and no pupils. He forces men through himself. The God is his own follower in man. He imitates himself.</p>
<p>We think that there is singleness within us, and communality outside us. Outside of us is the communal in relation to the external, while singleness refers to us. We are single if we are in ourselves, but communal in relation to what is outside us. But if we are outside of ourselves, then we are single and selfish in the communal. Our self suffers privation if we are outside ourselves, and thus it satisfies its needs with communality. Consequently, communality is distorted into singleness. If we are in ourselves, we fulfil the need of the self, we prosper, and through this we become aware of the needs of the communal and can fulfil them.152</p>
<p>If we set a God outside of ourselves, he tears us loose from the self, since the God is more powerful than we are. Our self falls into privation. But if the God moves into the self, he snatches us from what is outside us.153 We arrive at singleness in ourselves. So the God becomes communal in reference to what is outside us, but single in relation to us. No one has my God, but my God has everyone, including myself. The Gods of all individual men always have all other men, including myself. So it is always only the one God despite his multiplicity. You arrive at him in yourself and only through your self seizing you. It seizes you in the advancement of your life.</p>
<p>The hero must fall for the sake of our redemption, since he is the model and demands imitation. But the measure of imitation is fulfilled.154 We should become reconciled to solitude in ourselves and to the God outside of us. If we enter into this solitude then the life of the God begins. If we are in ourselves, then the space around us is free, but filled by the God.</p>
<p>Our relations to men go through this empty space and also through the God. But earlier it went through selfishness since we were outside ourselves. Therefore the spirit foretold to me that the cold of outer space will spread across the earth.155 With this he showed me in an image that the God will step between men and drive every individual with the whip of icy cold to the warmth of his own monastic hearth. Because people were beside themselves, going into raptures like madmen.</p>
<p>Selfish desire ultimately desires itself. You find yourself in your desire, so do not say that desire is vain. If you desire yourself, you produce the divine son in your embrace with yourself. Your desire is the father of the God, your self is the mother of the God, but the son is the new God, your master.</p>
<p>If you embrace your self, then it will appear to you as if the world has become cold and empty. The coming God moves into this emptiness.</p>
<p>If you are in your solitude, and all the space around you has become cold and unending, then you have moved far from men, and at the same time you have come near to them as never before. Selfish desire only apparently led you to men, but in reality it led you away from them and in the end to yourself, which to you and to others was the most remote. But now, if you are in solitude, your God leads you to the God of others, and through that to the true neighbor, to the neighbor of the self in others.</p>
<p>If you are in yourself, you become aware of your incapacity. You will see how little capable you are of imitating the heroes and of being a hero yourself. So you will also no longer force others to become heroes. Like you, they suffer from incapacity. Incapacity, too, wants to live, but it will overthrow your Gods. [BP v (r)] fol. v(r)/v(v)</p>
<p>Mysterium. Encounter</p>
<p>[HI v(v)]</p>
<p>Cap. ix.</p>
<p>On the night when I considered the essence of the God, I became aware of an image: I lay in a dark depth. An old man stood before me. He looked like one of the old prophets.156 A black serpent lay at his feet. Some distance away I saw a house with columns. A beautiful maiden steps out of the door. She walks uncertainly and I see that she is blind. The old man waves to me and I follow him to the house at the foot of the sheer wall of rock. The serpent creeps behind us. Darkness reigns inside the house. We are in a high hall with glittering walls. A bright stone the color of water lies in the background. As I look into its reflection, the images of Eve, the tree, and the serpent appear to me. After this I catch sight of Odysseus and his journey on the high seas. Suddenly a door opens on the right, onto a garden full of bright sunshine. We step outside and the old man says to me, “Do you know where you are?”</p>
<p>I: “I am a stranger here and everything seems strange to me, anxious as in a dream. Who are you?”</p>
<p>E: “I am Elijah157 and this is my daughter Salome.”158</p>
<p>I: “The daughter of Herod, the bloodthirsty woman?”</p>
<p>E: “Why do you judge so? You see that she is blind. She is my daughter, the daughter of the prophet.”</p>
<p>I: “What miracle has united you?”</p>
<p>E: “It is no miracle, it was so from the beginning. My wisdom and my daughter are one.”</p>
<p>I am shocked, I am incapable of grasping it.</p>
<p>E: “Consider this: her blindness and my sight have made us companions through eternity.”</p>
<p>I: “Forgive my astonishment, am I truly in the underworld?”</p>
<p>S: “Do you love me?”</p>
<p>I: “How can I love you? How do you come to this question? I see only one thing, you are Salome, a tiger, your hands are stained with the blood of the holy one. How should I love you?”</p>
<p>S: “You will love me.”</p>
<p>I: “I? Love you? Who gives you the right to such thoughts?”</p>
<p>S: “I love you.”</p>
<p>I: “Leave me be, I dread you, you beast.”</p>
<p>S: “You do me wrong. Elijah is my father, and he knows the deepest mysteries. The walls of his house are made of precious stones. His wells hold healing water and his eyes see the things of the future. And what wouldn’t you give for a single look into the infinite unfolding of what is to come? Are these not worth a sin for you?”</p>
<p>I: “Your temptation is devilish. I long to be back in the upper world. It is dreadful here. How oppressive and heavy is the air!”</p>
<p>E: “What do you want? The choice is yours.”</p>
<p>I: “But I do not belong to the dead. I live in the light of day. Why should I torment myself here with Salome? Do I not have enough of my own life to deal with?”</p>
<p>E: “You heard what Salome said.”</p>
<p>I: “I cannot believe that you, the prophet, can recognize her as a daughter and a companion. Is she not engendered from heinous seed? Was she not vain greed and criminal lust?”</p>
<p>E: “But she loved a holy man.”</p>
<p>I: “And shamefully shed his precious blood.”</p>
<p>E: “She loved the prophet who announced the new God to the world. She loved him, do you understand that? For she is my daughter.”</p>
<p>I: “Do you think that because she is your daughter, she loved the prophet in John, the father?”</p>
<p>E: “By her love shall you know her.”</p>
<p>I: “But how did she love him? Do you call that love?”</p>
<p>E: “What else was it?”</p>
<p>I: “I am horrified. Who wouldn’t be horrified if Salome loved him?”</p>
<p>E: “Are you cowardly? Consider this, I and my daughter have been one since eternity.”</p>
<p>I: “You pose dreadful riddles. How could it be that this unholy woman and you, the prophet of your God, could be one?”</p>
<p>E: “Why are you amazed? But you see it, we are together.”</p>
<p>I: “What my eyes see is exactly what I cannot grasp. You, Elijah, who are a prophet, the mouth of God, and she, a bloodthirsty horror. You are the symbol of the most extreme contradiction.”</p>
<p>E: “We are real and not symbols.”</p>
<p>I see how the black serpent writhes up the tree, and hides in the branches. Everything becomes gloomy and doubtful. Elijah rises, I follow and we go silently back through the hall.159 Doubt tears me apart. It is all so unreal and yet a part of my longing remains behind. Will I come again? Salome loves me, do I love her? I hear wild music, a tambourine, a sultry moonlit night, the bloody-staring head of the holy one160—fear seizes me. I rush out. I am surrounded by the dark night. It is pitch black all around me. Who murdered the hero? Is this why Salome loves me? Do I love her, and did I therefore murder the hero? She is one with the prophet, one with John, but also one with me? Woe, was she the hand of the God? I do not love her, I fear her. Then the spirit of the depths spoke to me and said: “Therein you acknowledge her divine power.” Must I love Salome?161</p>
<p>[2] 162*This play that I witnessed is my play, not your play. It is my secret, not yours. You cannot imitate me. My secret remains virginal and my mysteries are inviolable, they belong to me and cannot belong to you. You have your own.*163</p>
<p>*He who enters into his own must grope through what lies at hand, he must sense his way from stone to stone. He must embrace the worthless and the worthy with the same love. A mountain is nothing, and a grain of sand holds kingdoms, or also nothing. Judgment must fall from you, even taste, but above all pride, even when it is based on merit. Utterly poor, miserable, humiliated, ignorant, go on through the gate. Turn your anger against yourself, since only you stop yourself from looking and from living. The mystery play is soft like air and thin smoke, and you are raw matter that is disturbingly heavy. But let your hope, which is your highest good and highest ability, lead the way and serve you as a guide in the world of darkness, since it is of like substance with the forms of that world.*164 [Image v (v)]165</p>
<p>The scene of the mystery play is a deep place like the crater of a volcano. My deep interior is a volcano, that pushes out the fiery-molten mass of the unformed and the undifferentiated. Thus my interior gives birth to the children of chaos, of the primordial mother. He who enters the crater also becomes chaotic matter, he melts. The formed in him dissolves and binds itself anew with the children of chaos, the powers of darkness, the ruling and the seducing, the compelling and the alluring, the divine and the devilish. These powers stretch beyond my certainties and limits on all sides, and connect me with all forms and with all distant beings and things, through which inner tidings of their being and their character develop in me.</p>
<p>Because I have fallen into the source of chaos, into the primordial beginning, I myself become smelted anew in the connection with the primordial beginning, which at the same time is what has been and what is becoming. At first I come to the primordial beginning in myself. But because I am a part of the matter and formation of the world, I also come into the primordial beginning of the world in the first place. I have certainly participated in life as someone formed and determined, but only through my formed and determined consciousness and through this in a formed and determined piece of the whole world, but not in the unformed and undetermined aspects of the world that likewise are given to me. Yet it is given only to my depths, not to my surface, which is a formed and determined consciousness.</p>
<p>The powers of my depths are predetermination and pleasure.166 Predetermination or forethinking167 is Prometheus,168 who, without determined thoughts, brings the chaotic to form169 and definition, who digs the channels and holds the object before pleasure. Forethinking also comes before thought. But pleasure is the force that desires and destroys forms without form and definition. It loves the form in itself that it takes hold of, and destroys the forms that it does not take. The forethinker is a seer, but pleasure is blind. It does not foresee, but desires what it touches. Forethinking is not powerful in itself and therefore does not move. But pleasure is power, and therefore it moves. Forethinking needs pleasure to be able to come to form. Pleasure needs forethinking to come to form, which it requires.170 If pleasure lacked forming, pleasure would dissolve in manifoldness and become splintered and powerless through unending division, lost to the unending. If a form does not contain and compress pleasure within itself, it cannot reach the higher, since it always flows like water from above to below. All pleasure, when left alone, flows into the deep sea and ends in the deathly stillness of dispersal into unending space. Pleasure is not older than forethinking, and forethinking is not older than pleasure. Both are equally old and in nature intimately one. Only in man does the separate existence of both principles become apparent.</p>
<p>Apart from Elijah and Salome I found the serpent as a third principle.171 It is a stranger to both principles although it is associated with both. The serpent taught me the unconditional difference in essence between the two principles in me. If I look across from forethinking to pleasure, I first see the deterrent poisonous serpent. If I feel from pleasure across to forethinking, likewise I feel first the cold cruel serpent.172 The serpent is the earthly essence of man of which he is not conscious. Its character changes according to peoples and lands, since it is the mystery that flows to him from the nourishing earth-mother.173</p>
<p>The earthly (numen loci) separates forethinking and pleasure in man, but not in itself. The serpent has the weight of the earth in itself, but also its changeability and germination from which everything that becomes emerges. It is always the serpent that causes man to become enslaved now to one, now to the other principle, so that it becomes error. One cannot live with forethinking alone, or with pleasure alone. You need both. But you cannot be in forethinking and in pleasure at the same time, you must take turns being in forethinking and pleasure, obeying the prevailing law, unfaithful to the other so to speak. But men prefer one or the other. Some love thinking and establish the art of life on it. They practice their thinking and their circumspection, so they lose their pleasure. Therefore they are old and have a sharp face. The others love pleasure, they practice their feeling and living. Thus they forget thinking. Therefore they are young and blind. Those who think base the world on thought, those who feel, on feeling. You find truth and error in both.</p>
<p>The way of life writhes like the serpent from right to left and from left to right, from thinking to pleasure and from pleasure to thinking. Thus the serpent is an adversary and a symbol of enmity, but also a wise bridge that connects right and left through longing, much needed by our life.174</p>
<p>The place where Elijah and Salome live together is a dark space and a bright one. The dark space is the space of forethinking. It is dark, so he who lives there requires vision.175 This space is limited, so forethinking does not lead into the extended distance, but into the depth of the past and the future. The crystal is the formed thought that reflects what is to come in what has gone before.</p>
<p>Eve fol. v(v)/vi(r) and the serpent show me that my next step leads to pleasure and from there again on lengthy wanderings like Odysseus. He went astray when he played his trick at Troy.176 The bright garden is the space of pleasure. He who lives there needs no vision;177 he feels the unending.178 A thinker who descends into his forethinking finds his next step leading into the garden of Salome. Therefore the thinker fears his forethought, although he lives on the foundation of forethinking. The visible surface is safer than the underground. Thinking protects against the way of error, and therefore it leads to petrification.</p>
<p>A thinker should fear Salome, since she wants his head, especially if he is a holy man. A thinker cannot be a holy person, otherwise he loses his head. It does not help to hide oneself in thought. There the solidification overtakes you. You must turn back to motherly forethought to obtain renewal. But forethought leads to Salome.</p>
<p>179Because I was a thinker and caught sight of the hostile principle of pleasure from forethinking, it appeared to me as Salome. If I had been one who felt, and had groped my way toward forethinking, then it would have appeared to me as a serpent-encoiled daimon, if I had actually seen it. But I would have been blind. Therefore I would have felt only slippery, dead, dangerous, allegedly overcome, insipid, and mawkish things, and I would have pulled back with the same shudder I felt in turning from Salome.</p>
<p>The thinker’s passions are bad, therefore he has no pleasure. The thoughts of one who feels180 are bad, therefore he has no thoughts. He who prefers to think than to feel,181 leaves his feeling182 to rot in darkness. It does not grow ripe, but in moldiness produces sick tendrils that do not reach the light. He who prefers to feel than to think leaves his thinking in darkness, where it spins its nets in gloomy places, desolate webs in which mosquitos and gnats become enmeshed. The thinker feels the disgust of feeling, since the feeling in him is mainly disgusting. The one who feels thinks the disgust of thinking, since the thinking in him is mainly disgusting. So the serpent lies between the thinker and the one who feels. They are each other’s poison and healing.</p>
<p>In the garden it had to become apparent to me that I loved Salome. This recognition struck me, since I had not thought it. What a thinker does not think he believes does not exist, and what one who feels does not feel he believes does not exist. You begin to have a presentiment of the whole when you embrace your opposite principle, since the whole belongs to both principles, which grow from one root.183</p>
<p>Elijah said: “You should recognize her through her love!” Not only do you venerate the object, but the object also sanctifies you. Salome loved the prophet, and this sanctified her. The prophet loved God, and this sanctified him. But Salome did not love God, and this profaned her. But the prophet did not love Salome, and this profaned him. And thus they were each other’s poison and death. May the thinking person accept his pleasure, and the feeling person accept his own thought. Such leads one along the way.184</p>
<p>Instruction</p>
<p>[HI vi(r)]</p>
<p>Cap. x.</p>
<p>On the following night,185 I was led to a second image: I am standing in the rocky depth that seems to me like a crater. Before me I see the house with columns. I see Salome walking along the length of the wall toward the left, touching the wall like a blind person. The serpent follows her. The old man stands at the door and waves to me. Hesitantly I draw closer. He calls Salome back. She is like someone suffering. I cannot detect any sacrilege in her nature. Her hands are white and her face has a gentle expression. The serpent lies before them. I stand before them clumsily like a stupid boy, overwhelmed by uncertainty and ambiguity. The old man eyes me searchingly and says: “What do you want here?”</p>
<p>I: “Forgive me, it is not obtrusiveness or arrogance that leads me here. I am here perchance, not knowing what I want. A longing that stayed behind in your house yesterday has brought me here. You see, prophet, I am tired, my head is as heavy as lead. I am lost in my ignorance. I have toyed with myself enough. I played hypocritical games with myself and they all would have disgusted me, were it not clever to perform what others expect from us in the world of men. It seems to me as if I were more real here. And yet I do not like being here.”</p>
<p>Wordlessly Elijah and Salome step inside the house. I follow them reluctantly. A feeling of guilt torments me. Is it bad conscience? I would like to turn back, but I cannot. I stand before the play of fire in the shining crystal. I see in splendor the mother of God with the child. Peter stands in front of her in admiration—then Peter alone with the key—the Pope with a triple crown—a Buddha sitting rigidly in a circle of fire—a many-armed bloody Goddess186—it is Salome desperately wringing her hands187—it takes hold of me, she is my own soul, and now I see Elijah in the image of the stone.</p>
<p>Elijah and Salome stand smiling before me.</p>
<p>I: “These visions are full of torment, and the meaning of these images is dark to me, Elijah; please shed some light.”</p>
<p>Elijah turns away silently, and leads the way toward the left. Salome enters a colonnade to the right. Elijah leads me into an even darker room. A burning red lamp hangs from the ceiling. I sit down exhausted. Elijah stands before me leaning on a marble lion in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>E: “Are you anxious? Your ignorance is to blame for your bad conscience. Not-knowing is guilt, but you believe that it is the urge toward forbidden knowledge that causes your feeling of guilt. Why do you think you are here?”</p>
<p>I: “I don’t know. I sank into this place when unknowingly I tried resisting the not-known. So here I am, astonished and confused, an ignorant fool. I experience strange things in your house, things that frighten me and whose meaning is dark to me.”</p>
<p>E: “If it were not your law to be here, how would you be here?”</p>
<p>I: “I’m afflicted by fatal weakness, my father.”</p>
<p>E: “You are evasive. You cannot extricate yourself from your law.”</p>
<p>I: “How can I extricate myself from what is unknown to me, which I cannot reach with either feeling or presentiment?”</p>
<p>E: “You are lying. Do you not know that you yourself recognized what it means if Salome loves you?”</p>
<p>I: “You are right. A doubtful and uncertain thought arose in me. But I have forgotten it again.”</p>
<p>E: “You have not forgotten it. It burned deep inside you. Are you cowardly? Or can you not differentiate this thought from your own self, enough so that you wished to claim it for yourself?”</p>
<p>I: “The thought went too far for me, and I shun far-fetched ideas. They are dangerous, since I am a man, and you know how much men are accustomed to seeing thoughts as their very own, so that they eventually confuse them with themselves.”</p>
<p>E: “Will you therefore confuse yourself with a tree or animal, because you look at them and because you exist with them in one and the same world? Must you be your thoughts, because you are in the world of your thoughts? But your thoughts are just as much outside your self as trees and animals are outside your body.”188</p>
<p>I: “I understand. My thought world was for me more word than world. I thought of my thought world: it is I.”</p>
<p>E: “Do you say to your human world and every being outside of you: you are I?”</p>
<p>I: “I stepped into your house, my father, with the fear of a schoolboy. But you taught me salutary wisdom189: I can also consider my thoughts as being outside my self. That helps me to return to that terrible conclusion that my tongue is reluctant to express. I thought that Salome loves me because I resemble John or you. This thought seemed unbelievable to me. That’s why I rejected it and thought that she loves me because I am really quite opposite to you, that she loves her badness in my badness. This thought was devastating.”</p>
<p>Elijah is silent. Heaviness lies on me. Then Salome steps in, comes over to me and lays her arm around my shoulder. She takes me for her father in whose chair I sat. I dare neither move nor speak.</p>
<p>S: “I know that you are not my father. You are his son, and I am your sister.”</p>
<p>I: “You, Salome, my sister? Was this the terrible attraction that emanated from you, that unnamable horror of you, of your touch? Who was our mother?”</p>
<p>S: “Mary.”</p>
<p>I: “Is it a hellish dream? Mary, our mother? What madness lurks in your words? The mother of our Savior, our mother? When I crossed your threshold today, I foresaw calamity. Alas! It has come. Are you out of your senses, Salome? Elijah, protector of the divine law, speak: is this a devilish spell cast by the rejected? How can she say such a thing? Or are both of you out of your senses? You are symbols and Mary is a symbol. I am simply too confused to see through you now.”</p>
<p>E: “You may call us symbols for the same reason that you can also call your fellow men symbols, if you wish to. But we are just as real as your fellow men. You invalidate nothing and solve nothing by calling us symbols.”</p>
<p>I: “You plunge me into a terrible confusion. Do you wish to be real?”</p>
<p>E: “We are certainly what you call real. Here we are, and you have to accept us. The choice is yours.”</p>
<p>I am silent. Salome has removed herself. Uncertainly I look around. Behind me a high golden red flame burns on a round altar. The serpent has encircled the flame. Its eyes glitter with golden reflections. Swaying I turn to the exit. As I step out into the hall, I see a powerful lion going before me. Outside, it is a wide cold starry night.</p>
<p>[2] 190It is no small matter to acknowledge one’s yearning. For this many need to make a particular effort at honesty. All too many do not want to know where their yearning is, because it would seem to them impossible or too distressing. And yet yearning is the way of life. If you do not acknowledge your yearning, then you do not follow yourself, but go on foreign ways that others have indicated to you. So you do not live your life but an alien one. But who should live your life if you do not live it? It is not only stupid to exchange your own life for an alien one, but also a hypocritical game, because you can never really live the life of others, you can only pretend to do it, deceiving the other and yourself, since you can only live your own life.</p>
<p>If you give up your self, you live it in others; thereby you become selfish to others, and thus you deceive others. Everyone thus believes that such a life is possible. It is, however, only apish imitation. Through giving in to your apish appetite, you infect others, because the ape stimulates the apish. So you turn yourself and others into apes. Through reciprocal imitation you live according to the average expectation. The image of the hero was set up for all in every age through the appetite for imitation. Therefore the hero was murdered, since we have all been aping him. Do you know why you cannot abandon apishness? For fear of loneliness and defeat.</p>
<p>To live oneself means: to be one’s own task. Never say that it is a pleasure to live oneself. It will be no joy but a long suffering, since you must become your own creator. If you want to create yourself, then you do not begin with the best and the highest, but with the worst and the deepest. Therefore say that you are reluctant to live yourself. The flowing together of the stream of life is not joy but pain, since it is power against power, guilt, and shatters the sanctified.</p>
<p>The image of the mother of God with the child that I foresee, indicates to me the mystery of the transformation.191 If forethinking and pleasure unite in me, a third arises from them, the divine son, who is the supreme meaning, the symbol, the passing over into a new creation. I do not myself become the supreme meaning192 or the symbol, but the symbol becomes in me such that it has its substance, and I mine. Thus I stand like Peter in worship before the miracle of the transformation and the becoming real of the God in me.</p>
<p>Although I am not the son of the God myself, I represent him nevertheless as one who was a mother to the God, and one therefore to whom in the name of the God the freedom of the binding and loosing has been given. The binding and loosing take place in me.193 But insofar as it takes place in me, and I am a part of the world, it also takes place through me in the world, and no one can hinder it. It doesn’t take place according to the way of my will but in the way of unavoidable effect. I am not master over you, but the being of the God in me. I lock the past with one key, with the other I open the future. This takes place through my transformation. The miracle of transformation commands. I am its servant, just as the Pope is.</p>
<p>You see how incredible it was to believe such of oneself.194 It applies not to me, but to the symbol. The symbol becomes my lord and unfailing commander. It will fortify its reign and change itself into a fixed and riddling image, whose meaning turns completely inward, and whose pleasure radiates outward like blazing fire,195 a Buddha in the flames.196 Because I sink into my symbol to such an extent, the symbol changes me from my one into my other, and that cruel Goddess of my interior, my womanly pleasure, my own other, the tormented tormentor, that which is to be tormented. I have interpreted these images, as best I can, with poor words.</p>
<p>197In the moment of your bewilderment, follow your forethinking and not your blind desire, since forethinking leads you to the difficulties that should always come first. They come nevertheless. If you look for a light, you fall first into an even deeper darkness. In this darkness you find a light with a weak reddish flame that gives only a low brightness, but it is enough for you to see your neighbor. It is exhausting to reach this goal that seems to be no goal. And so it is good: I am paralyzed and therefore ready to accept. My forethinking rests on the lion, my power.198</p>
<p>I held to the sanctified form, and didn’t want to allow the chaos to break through its dams. I believed in the order of the world and hated everything disorganized and unformed. Therefore above all I had to realize that my own law had brought me to this place. As the God developed in me, I thought he was a part of my self. I thought that my “I” included him and therefore I took him for my thought. But I also considered that my thoughts were parts of my “I.” Thus I entered into my thoughts, and into the thinking about the God, in that I took him fol. vi(r)/vi(v) for a part of my self.</p>
<p>On account of my thoughts, I had left myself; therefore my self became hungry and made God into a selfish thought. If I leave myself, my hunger will drive me to find my self in my object, that is, in my thought. Therefore you love reasonable and orderly thoughts, since you could not endure it if your self was in disordered, that is, unsuitable thoughts. Through your selfish wish, you pushed out of your thoughts everything that you do not consider ordered, that is, unfitting. You create order according to what you know, you do not know the thoughts of chaos, and yet they exist. My thoughts are not my self, and my I does not embrace the thought. Your thought has this meaning and that, not just one, but many meanings. No one knows how many.</p>
<p>My thoughts are not my self, but exactly like the things of the world, alive and dead.199 Just as I am not damaged through living in a partly chaotic world, so too I am not damaged if I live in my partly chaotic thought world. Thoughts are natural events that you do not possess, and whose meaning you only imperfectly recognize.200 Thoughts grow in me like a forest, populated by many different animals. But man is domineering in his thinking, and therefore he kills the pleasure of the forest and that of the wild animals. Man is violent in his desire, and he himself becomes a forest and a forest animal. Just as I have freedom in the world, I also have freedom in my thoughts. Freedom is conditional.</p>
<p>To certain things of the world I must say: you should not be thus, but you should be different. Yet first I look carefully at their nature, otherwise I cannot change it. I proceed in the same way with certain thoughts. You change those things of the world that, not being useful in themselves, endanger your welfare. Proceed likewise with your thoughts. Nothing is complete, and much is in dispute. The way of life is transformation, not exclusion. Well-being is a better judge than the law.</p>
<p>But as I became aware of the freedom in my thought world, Salome embraced me and I thus became a prophet, since I had found pleasure in the primordial beginning, in the forest, and in the wild animals. It stands too close to reason for me to set myself on a par with my visions, and for me to take pleasure in seeing. I am in danger of believing that I myself am significant since I see the significant. This will always drive us crazy, and we transform the vision into foolishness and monkey business, since we cannot desist from imitation.201</p>
<p>Just as my thinking is the son of forethinking, so is my pleasure the daughter of love, of the innocent and conceiving mother of God. Aside from Christ Mary gave birth to Salome. Therefore Christ in the gospel of the Egyptians says to Salome: “Eat every herb, but do not eat the bitter.” And when Salome wanted to know, Christ spoke to her: “If you crush the covering of shame, and when the two become one, and the male with the female, neither male nor female.”202</p>
<p>Forethinking is the procreative, love is the receptive.203 Both are beyond this world. Here are understanding and pleasure, we only suspect the other. It would be madness to claim that they are in this world. So much that is riddling and cunning coils around this light. I won the power back again from the depths, and it went before me like a lion.204</p>
<p>Resolution</p>
<p>[HI vi(v)]205</p>
<p>Cap. xi.</p>
<p>206On the third night, deep longing to continue experiencing the mysteries seized me. The struggle between doubt and desire was great in me. But suddenly I saw that I stood before a steep ridge in a wasteland. It is a dazzling bright day. I catch sight of the prophet high above me. His hand makes an averting movement, and I abandon my decision to climb up. I wait below, gazing upward. I look: to the right it is dark night; to the left it is bright day. The rock separates day and night. On the dark side lies a big black serpent, on the bright side a white serpent. They thrust their heads toward each other, eager for battle. Elijah stands on the heights above them. The serpents pounce on one another and a terrible wrestling ensues. The black serpent seems to be stronger; the white serpent draws back. Great billows of dust rise from the place of struggle. But then I see: the black serpent pulls itself back again. The front part of its body has become white. Both serpents curl about themselves, one in light, the other in darkness.207</p>
<p>Elijah: “What did you see?”</p>
<p>I: “I saw the fight of two formidable serpents. It seemed to me as if the black would overcome the white serpent; but behold, the black one withdrew and its head and the top part of its body had turned white.”</p>
<p>E: “Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>I: “I have thought it over, but I cannot understand it. Should it mean that the power of the good light will become so great that even the darkness that resists it will be illumined by it?”</p>
<p>Elijah climbs before me into the heights, to a very high summit; I follow. On the peak we come to some masonry made of huge blocks. It is a round embankment on the summit.208 Inside lies a large courtyard, and there is a mighty boulder in the middle, like an altar. The prophet stands on this stone and says: “This is the temple of the sun. This place is a vessel, that collects the light of the sun.”</p>
<p>Elijah climbs down from the stone, his form becomes smaller in descending, and finally becomes dwarflike, unlike himself.</p>
<p>I ask: “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“I am Mime,209 and I will show you the wellsprings. The collected light becomes water and flows in many springs from the summit into the valleys of the earth.” He then dives down into a crevice. I follow him down into a dark cave. I hear the rippling of a spring. I hear the voice of the dwarf from below: “Here are my wells, whoever drinks from them becomes wise.”</p>
<p>But I cannot reach down. I lose courage. I leave the cave and, doubting, pace back and forth in the square of the yard. Everything appears to me strange and incomprehensible. It is solitary and deathly silent here. The air is clear and cool as on the remotest heights, a wonderful flood of sunlight all around, the great wall surrounds me. A serpent crawls over the stone. It is the serpent of the prophet. How did it come out of the underworld into the world above? I follow it and see how it crawls into the wall. I feel weird all over: a little house stands there with a portico, minuscule, snuggling against the rock. The serpents become infinitely small. I feel as if I too am shrinking. The walls enlarge into a huge mountain and I see that I am below on the foundation of the crater in the underworld, and I stand before the house of the prophet.210 He steps out of the door of his house.</p>
<p>I: “I notice, Elijah, that you have shown me and let me experience all sorts of strange things and allowed me to come before you today. But I confess that it is all dark to me. Your world appears to me today in a new light. Just now it was as if I were separated by a starry distance from your place, which I still wanted to reach today. But behold: it seems to be one and the same place.”</p>
<p>E: “You wanted to come here far too much. I did not deceive you, you deceived yourself. He sees badly who wants to see; you have overreached yourself.”</p>
<p>I: “It is true, I eagerly longed to reach you, to hear more. Salome startled me and led me into bewilderment. I felt dizzy, because what she said seemed to me to be monstrous and like madness. Where is Salome?”</p>
<p>E: “How impetuous you are! What is up with you? Step over to the crystal and prepare yourself in its light.”</p>
<p>A wreath of fire shines around the stone. I am seized with fear at what I see: The coarse peasant’s boot? The foot of a giant that crushes an entire city? I see the cross, the removal of the cross, the mourning. How agonizing this sight is! No longer do I yearn—I see the divine child, with the white serpent in his right hand, and the black serpent in his left hand. I see the green mountain, the cross of Christ on it, and a stream of blood flowing from the summit of the mountain—I can look no longer, it is unbearable—I see the cross and Christ on it in his last hour and torment—at the foot of the cross the black serpent coils itself—it has wound itself around my feet—I am held fast and I spread my arms wide. Salome draws near. The serpent has wound itself around my whole body, and my countenance is that of a lion.</p>
<p>Salome says, “Mary was the mother of Christ, do you understand?”</p>
<p>I: “I see that a terrible and incomprehensible power forces me to imitate the Lord in his final torment. But how can I presume to call Mary my mother?”</p>
<p>S: “You are Christ.”</p>
<p>I stand with outstretched arms like someone crucified, my body taut and horribly entwined by the serpent: “You, Salome, say that I am Christ?”211</p>
<p>It is as if I stood alone on a high mountain with stiff outstretched arms. The serpent squeezes my body in its terrible coils and the blood streams from my body, spilling down the mountainside. Salome bends down to my feet and wraps her black hair round them. She lies thus for a long time. Then she cries, “I see light!” Truly, she sees, her eyes are open. The serpent falls from my body and lies languidly on the ground. I stride over it and kneel at the feet of the prophet, whose form shines like a flame.</p>
<p>E: “Your work is fulfilled here. Other things will come. Seek untiringly, and above all write exactly what you see.”</p>
<p>Salome looks in rapture at the light that streams from the prophet. Elijah transforms into a huge flame of white light. The serpent wraps itself around her foot, as if paralyzed. Salome kneels before the light in wonderstruck devotion. Tears fall from my eyes, and I hurry out into the night, like one who has no part in the glory of the mystery. My feet do not touch the ground of this earth, and it is as if I were melting into air.212</p>
<p>[2] 213My longing214 led me up to the overbright day, whose light is the opposite to the dark space of forethinking.215 The opposite principle is, as I think I understand it, heavenly love, the mother. The darkness that surrounds forethinking216 appears to be due to the fact that it is invisible in the interior and takes place in the depths.217 But the brightness of love seems to come from the fact that love is visible life and action. My pleasure was with forethinking and had its merry garden there, surrounded by darkness and night. I climbed down to my pleasure, but ascended to my love. I see Elijah high above me: this indicates that forethinking stands nearer to love than I, a man, do. Before I ascend to love, a condition must be fulfilled, which represents itself as the fight between two serpents. Left is day, right is night. The realm of love is light, the realm of forethinking is dark. Both principles have separated themselves strictly, and are even hostile to one another and have taken on the form of serpents. This form indicates the daimonic nature of both principles. I recognize in this struggle a repetition of that vision where I saw the struggle between the sun and the black serpent.218</p>
<p>At that time, the loving light was annihilated, and blood began to pour out. This was the great war. But the spirit of the depths219 wants this struggle to be understood as a conflict in every man’s own nature.220 Since after the death of the hero our urge to live could no longer imitate anything, it therefore went into the depths of every man and excited the terrible conflict between the powers of the depths.221 Forethinking is singleness, love is togetherness. Both need one another, and yet they kill one another. Since men do not know that the conflict occurs inside themselves, they go mad, fol. vi(v)/vii(r) and one lays the blame on the other. If one-half of mankind is at fault, then every man is half at fault. But he does not see the conflict in his own soul, which is however the source of the outer disaster. If you are aggravated against your brother, think that you are aggravated against the brother in you, that is, against what in you is similar to your brother.</p>
<p>As a man you are part of mankind, and therefore you have a share in the whole of mankind, as if you were the whole of mankind. If you overpower and kill your fellow man who is contrary to you, then you also kill that person in yourself and have murdered a part of your life. The spirit of this dead man follows you and does not let your life become joyful. You need your wholeness to live onward.</p>
<p>If I myself endorse the pure principle, I step to one side and become onesided. Therefore my forethinking in the principle222 of the heavenly mother becomes an ugly dwarf who lives in a dark cave like an unborn in the womb. You do not follow him, even if he says to you that you could drink wisdom from his source. But forethinking223 appears to you there as dwarfish cleverness, false and of the night, just as the heavenly mother appears to me down there as Salome. That which is lacking in the pure principle appears as the serpent. The hero strives after the utmost in the pure principle, and therefore he finally falls for the serpent. If you go to thinking,224 take your heart with you. If you go to love, take your head with you. Love is empty without thinking, thinking hollow without love. The serpent lurks behind the pure principle. Therefore I lost courage, until I found the serpent that at once led me across to the other principle. In climbing down I become smaller.</p>
<p>Great is he who is in love, since love is the present act of the great creator, the present moment of the becoming and lapsing of the world. Mighty is he who loves. But whoever distances himself from love, feels himself powerful.</p>
<p>In your forethinking you recognize the nullity of your current being as a smallest point between the infinity of what has passed and of what is to come. The thinker is small, he feels great if he distances himself from thinking. But if we speak about appearances, it is the other way around. To whoever is in love, form is a trifling. But his field of vision ends with the form given to him. To whoever is in thinking, form is unsurpassable and the height of Heaven. But at night he sees the diversity of the innumerable worlds and their never-ending cycles. Whoever is in love is a full and overflowing vessel, and awaits the giving. Whoever is in forethinking is deep and hollow and awaits fulfillment.</p>
<p>Love and forethinking are in one and the same place. Love cannot be without forethinking, and forethinking cannot be without love. Man is always too much in one or the other. This comes with human nature. Animals and plants seem to have enough in every way, only man staggers between too much and too little. He wavers, he is uncertain how much he must give here and how much there. His knowledge and ability is insufficient, and yet he must still do it himself. Man doesn’t only grow from within himself, for he is also creative225 from within himself. The God becomes revealed in him.226 Human nature is little skilled in divinity, and therefore man fluctuates between too much and too little.227</p>
<p>The spirit of this time has condemned us to haste. You have no more futurity and no more past if you serve the spirit of this time. We need the life of eternity. We bear the future and the past in the depths. The future is old and the past is young. You serve the spirit of this time, and believe that you are able to escape the spirit of the depths. But the depths do not hesitate any longer and will force you into the mysteries of Christ.228 It belongs to this mystery that man is not redeemed through the hero, but becomes a Christ himself. The antecedent example of the saints symbolically teaches us this.</p>
<p>Whoever wants to see will see badly. It was my will that deceived me. It was my will that provoked the huge uproar among the daimons. Should I therefore not want anything? I have, and I have fulfilled my will as well as I could, and thus I fed everything in me that strived. In the end I found that I wanted myself in everything, but without looking for myself. Therefore I no longer wanted to seek myself outside of myself, but within. Then I wanted to grasp myself, and then I wanted to go on again, without knowing what I wanted, and thus I fell into the mystery.</p>
<p>Should I therefore not want anything anymore? You wanted this war. That is good. If you had not, then the evil of this war would be small.229 But with your wanting you make the evil great. If you do not succeed in producing the greatest evil out of this war, you will never learn the violent deed and learn to overcome fighting what lies outside you.230 Therefore it is good if you want this greatest evil with your whole heart.231 You are Christians and run after heroes, and wait for redeemers who should take the agony on themselves for you, and totally spare you Golgotha. With that you232 pile up a mountain of Calvary over all Europe. If you succeed in making a terrible evil out of this war and throw innumerable victims into this abyss, this is good, since it makes each of you ready to sacrifice himself. For as I, you draw close to the accomplishment of Christ’s mystery.</p>
<p>You already feel the fist of the iron one on your back. This is the beginning of the way. If blood, fire, and the cry of distress fill this world, then you will recognize yourself in your acts: Drink your fill of the bloody atrocities of the war, feast upon the killing and destruction, then your eyes will open, you will see that you yourselves are the bearers of such fruit.233 You are on the way if you will all this. Willing creates blindness, and blindness leads to the way. Should we will error? You should not, but you do will that error which you take for the best truth, as men have always done.</p>
<p>The symbol of the crystal signifies the unalterable law of events that comes of itself. In this seed you grasp what is to come. I saw something terrible and incomprehensible. (It was on the night of Christmas day of the year 1913.) I saw the peasant’s boot, the sign of the horrors of the peasant war,234 of murdering incendiaries and of bloody cruelty. I knew to interpret this sign for myself as nothing but the fact that something bloody and dreadful lay before us. I saw the foot of a giant that crushed a whole city. How could I interpret this sign otherwise? I saw that the way to self-sacrifice began here. They will all become terribly enraptured by these tremendous experiences, and in their blindness will want to understand them as outer events. It is an inner happening; that is the way to the perfection of the mystery of Christ,235 so that the peoples learn self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>May the frightfulness become so great that it can turn men’s eyes inward, so that their will no longer seeks the self in others but in themselves.236 I saw it, I know that this is the way. I saw the death of Christ and I saw his lament; I felt the agony of his dying, of the great dying. I saw a new God, a child, who subdued daimons in his hand.237 The God holds the separate principles in his power, he unites them. The God develops through the union of the principles in me. He is their union.</p>
<p>If you will one of these principles, so you are in one, but far from your being other. If you will both principles, one and the other, then you excite the conflict between the principles, since you cannot want both at the same time. From this arises the need, the God appears in it, he takes your conflicting will in his hand, in the hand of a child whose will is simple and beyond conflict. You cannot learn this, it can only develop in you. You cannot will this, it takes the will from your hand and wills itself. Will yourself, that leads to the way.238</p>
<p>But fundamentally you are terrified of yourself, and therefore you prefer to run to all others rather than to yourself. I saw the mountain of the sacrifice, and the blood poured in streams from its sides. When I saw how pride and power satisfied men, how beauty beamed from the eyes of women when the great war broke out, I knew that mankind was on the way to self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>The spirit of the depths239 has seized mankind and forces self-sacrifice upon it. Do not seek the guilt here or there. The spirit of the depths clutched the fate of man unto itself, as it clutched mine. He leads mankind through the river of blood to the mystery. In the mystery man himself becomes the two principles, the lion and the serpent.</p>
<p>Because I also want my being other, I must become a Christ. I am made into Christ, I must suffer it. Thus the redeeming blood flows. Through the self-sacrifice my pleasure is changed and goes above into its higher principle. Love is sighted, but pleasure is blind. Both principles are one in the symbol of the flame. The principles strip themselves of human form.240</p>
<p>The mystery showed me in images what I should afterward live. I did not possess any of those boons that the mystery showed me, for I still had to earn all of them.241</p>

<p>1.Medieval manuscripts were numbered by folios instead of pages. The front side of the folio is the recto (the right-hand page of an open book), and the back is the verso (the left-hand of an open book). In <em>Liber Primus</em>, Jung followed this practice. He reverted to contemporary pagination in <em>Liber Secundus</em>.</p>
<p>2.In 1921, Jung cited the first three verses of this passage (from Luther’s Bible), noting: “The birth of the Savior, the development of the redeeming symbol, takes place where one does not expect it, and from precisely where a solution is most improbable” (<em>Psychological Types</em>, <em>CW</em> 6, §439).</p>
<p>3.In 1921, Jung cited this passage, noting: “The nature of the redeeming symbol is that of a child, that is the childlikeness or presuppositionlessness of the attitude belongs to the symbol and its function. This ‘childlike’ attitude necessarily brings with it another guiding principle in place of self-will and rational intentions, whose ‘godlikeness’ is synonymous with ‘superiority.’ Since it is of an irrational nature, the guiding principle appears in a miraculous form. Isaiah expresses his connection very well (9:5) . . . These honorific titles reproduce the essential qualities of the redeeming symbol. The criterion of ‘godlike’ effect is the irresistible power of the unconscious impulses” (<em>Psychological Types, CW</em> 6, §442–43).</p>
<p>4.In 1955/56, Jung noted that the union of the opposites of the destructive and constructive powers of the unconscious paralleled the Messianic state of fulfillment depicted in this passage (<em>Mysterium Coniunctionis, CW</em> 14, §258).</p>
<p>5.In Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, Faust says to Wagner: “What you call the spirit of the times / is fundamentally the gentleman’s own mind, / in which the times are reflected” (<em>Faust</em> 1, lines 577–79).</p>
<p>6.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “And then one whom I did not know, but who evidently had such knowledge, said to me: ‘What a strange task you have! You must disclose your innermost and lowermost.’ / This I resisted since I hated nothing more than that which seemed to me unchaste and insolent” (p. 1).</p>
<p>7.In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung interpreted God as a symbol of the libido (<em>CW</em> B, §111). In his subsequent work, Jung laid great emphasis on the distinction between the God image and the metaphysical existence of God (cf. passages added to the revised retitled 1952 edition, <em>Symbols of Transformation</em>, <em>CW</em> 5, §95).</p>
<p>8.The terms <em>hinübergehen</em> (going across), <em>Übergang</em> (going-across), <em>Untergang</em> (down-going), and <em>Brücke</em> (bridge) feature in Nietzsche’s <em>Zarathustra</em> in relation to the passage from man to the <em>Übermensch</em> (superman). For example, “What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what can be loved in man is that he is a going-across and a down-going. / I love those who do not know how to live except their lives be a down-going, for they are those who are going over” (tr. R. Hollingdale [Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984], p. 44, tr. mod; words are as underlined in Jung’s copy).</p>
<p>9.Jung seems to be referring to episodes that occur later in the text: the healing of Izdubar (<em>Liber Secundus</em>, ch. 9), and the drinking of the bitter drink prepared by the solitary (<em>Liber Secundus</em>, ch. 20).</p>
<p>10.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Who drinks this drink will never again thirst for this world nor for the afterlife since he drank crossing and completion. He drank the hot melting river of life which congeals to hard ore in his soul and awaits new melting and mixture” (p. 4).</p>
<p>11.The calligraphic volume has: “this supreme meaning.”</p>

<p>15.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “I Beginning” (p. 7).</p>
<p>16.Jung discussed this vision on several occasions, stressing different details: in his 1925 seminar <em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em> (p. 44f), to Mircea Eliade (see above, p. 28), and in <em>Memories</em> (pp. 199–200). Jung was on the way to Schaffhausen, where his mother-in-law lived; her fifty-seventh birthday was on October 17. The journey by train takes about one hour.</p>
<p>17.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “with a friend (whose lack of farsightedness and whose improvidence I had in reality often noted)” (p. 8).</p>
<p>18.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “my friend, however, wanted to return on a small and slower ship, which I considered stupid and imprudent” (p. 8).</p>
<p>19.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “and there I found, strangely enough, my friend, who had evidently taken the same faster ship without my noticing” (pp. 8–9).</p>
<p>20.Ice wine is made by leaving grapes on the vine until they are frozen by frost. They are then pressed, and the ice is removed, leading to a highly concentrated delectable sweet wine.</p>
<p>21.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “This was my dream. All my efforts to understand it were in vain. I labored for days. Its impression, however, was powerful” (p. 9). Jung also recounted this dream in <em>Memories</em> (p. 200).</p>
<p>22.See introduction, p. 28.</p>
<p>23.In the <em>Draft</em>, this is addressed to “my friends” (p. 9).</p>
<p>24.Cf. the contrast to John 14:6: “Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”</p>
<p>25.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “This is not a law, but notice of the fact that the time of example and law, and of the straight line drawn in advance has become overripe” (p. 10).</p>
<p>26.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “My tongue shall wither if I serve up laws, if I prattle to you about teachings. Those who seek such will leave my table hungry” (p. 10).</p>
<p>27.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “only one law exists, and that is your law. Only one truth exists, and that is your truth” (p. 10).</p>
<p>28.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “One should not turn people into sheep, but sheep into people. The spirit of the depth demands this, who is beyond present and past. Speak and write for those who want to listen and read. But do not run after men, so that you do not soil the dignity of humanity—it is a rare good. A sad demise in dignity is better than an undignified healing. Whoever wants to be a doctor of the soul sees people as being sick. He offends human dignity. It is presumptuous to say that man is sick. Whoever wants to be the soul’s shepherd treats people like sheep. He violates human dignity. It is insolent to say that people are like sheep. Who gives you the right to say that man is sick and a sheep? Give him human dignity so he may find his ascendancy or downfall, his way” (p. 11).</p>
<p>29.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “This is all, my dear friends, that I can tell you about the grounds and aims of my message, which I am burdened with like the patient donkey with a heavy load. He is glad to put it down” (p. 12).</p>
<p>30.In the text, Jung identifies the white bird as his soul. For Jung’s discussion of the dove in alchemy, see <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em> (1955/56) (<em>CW</em> 14, §81).</p>
<p>31.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “<em>First Nights</em>” (p. 13).</p>
<p>32.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has: “Dear Friends!” (p. 1). The <em>Draft</em> has “Dear Friends!” (p. 1). In his lecture at the <em>ETH</em> on June 14, 1935, Jung noted: “A point exists at about the thirty-fifth year when things begin to change, it is the first moment of the shadow side of life, of the going down to death. It is clear that Dante found this point and those who have read <em>Zarathustra</em> will know that Nietzsche also discovered it. When this turning point comes people meet it in several ways: some turn away from it; others plunge into it; and something important happens to yet others from the outside. If we do not see a thing Fate does it to us” (Barbara Hannah, ed., <em>Modern Psychology Vol. 1 and 2: Notes on Lectures given at the Eidgenössiche Technische Hochschule, Zürich, by Prof. Dr. C. G. Jung, October 1933–July 1935, 2nd ed</em>. [Zürich: privately printed, 1959], p. 223).</p>
<p>33.On October 27, 1913, Jung wrote to Freud breaking off relations with him and resigning as editor of the <em>Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen</em> (William McGuire, ed., <em>The Freud/Jung Letters</em>, tr. R. Mannheim and R.F.C. Hull [Princeton: Princeton University Press/Bollingen Series, 1974], p. 550).</p>
<p>34.November 12, 1913. After “longing,” the <em>Draft</em> has “at the beginning of the following month, I seized my pen and began writing this” (p. 13).</p>
<p>35.This affirmation occurs a number of times in Jung’s later writings—see for example, Jane Pratt, “Notes on a talk given by C. G. Jung: ‘Is analytical psychology a religion?’ ” <em>Spring Journal of Archetypal Psychology and Jungian Thought</em> (1972), p. 148.</p>
<p>36.Jung later described his personal transformation at this time as an example of the beginning of the second half of life, which frequently marked a return to the soul, after the goals and ambitions of the first half of life had been achieved (<em>Symbols of Transformation</em> [1952], <em>CW</em> 5, p. xxvi); see also “The turning point of life” (1930, <em>CW</em> 8).</p>
<p>37.Jung is referring here to his earlier work. For example, he had written in 1905, “Through the associations experiment we are at least given the means to pave the way for the experimental research of the mysteries of the sick soul” (“The psychopathological meaning of the associations experiment,” <em>CW</em> 2, §897).</p>
<p>38.In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921) Jung noted that in psychology, conceptions are “a product of the subjective psychological constellation of the researcher” (<em>CW</em> 6, §9). This reflexivity formed an important theme in his later work (see my <em>Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology: The Dream of a Science</em>, §1).</p>
<p>39.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “a dead system that I had contrived, assembled from so-called experiences and judgments” (p. 16).</p>
<p>40.In 1913, Jung called this process the introversion of the libido (“On the question of psychological types,” <em>CW</em> 6).</p>
<p>41.In 1912, Jung had written, “It is a common error <em>to judge longing in terms of the quality of the object</em> .. . Nature is only beautiful on account of the longing and love accorded to it by man. The aesthetic attributes emanating therefrom apply first and foremost to the libido, which alone accounts for the beauty of nature” (<em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>, <em>CW</em> B, §147).</p>
<p>42.In <em>Psychological Types</em>, Jung articulated this primacy of the image through his notion of <em>esse in anima</em> (<em>CW</em> 6, §66ff, §711ff). In her diary notes, Cary Baynes commented on this passage: “What struck me especially was what you said about the “Bild” [image] being half the world. That is the thing that makes humanity so dull. They have missed understanding that thing. The world, that is the thing that holds them rapt. ‘Das Bild’, they have never seriously considered unless they have been poets” (February 8, 1924, <em>CFB</em>).</p>
<p>43.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “He who strives only for things will sink into poverty as outer wealth increases, and his soul will be afflicted by protracted illness” (p. 17).</p>
<p>44.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “This parable about refinding the soul, my friends, is meant to show you that you have only seen me as half a man, since my soul had lost me. I am certain that you did not notice this; because how many are with their souls today? Yet without the soul, there is no path that leads beyond these times” (p. 17). In her diary notes Cary Baynes commented on this passage: “February 8th [1924]. I came to your conversation with your soul. All that you say is said in the right way and is sincere. It is no cry of the young man awakening into life but that of the mature man who has lived fully and richly in ways of the world and yet knows almost abruptly one night, say, that he has missed the essence. The vision came at the height of your power, when you could have gone on just as you were with perfect worldly success. I do not know how you were strong enough to give it heed. I am really for everything you say and understand it. Everyone who has lost the connection with his soul or has known how to give it life ought to have a chance to see this book. Every word so far lives for me and strengthens me just where I feel weak, but as you say the world is very far away from it in mood today. That does not matter too much, a book can swing even a whole world if it is written in fire and blood” (<em>CFB</em>).</p>
<p>45.In 1945, Jung commented on the symbolism of the bird and serpent in connection with the tree, “The philosophical tree” (ch. 12, <em>CW</em> 13).</p>
<p>46.November 14, 1913.</p>
<p>47.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “which were dark to me, and which I sought to grasp in my own inadequate way” (p. 18).</p>
<p>48.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “I belonged to men and things. I did not belong to myself.” In <em>Black Book 2</em>, Jung states that he wandered for eleven years (p. 19). He had stopped writing in this book in 1902, taking it up again in the autumn of 1913.</p>
<p>49.<em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “And I found you again only through the soul of the woman” (p. 8).</p>
<p>50.<em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “Look, I bear a wound that is as yet not healed: my ambition to make an impression” (p. 8).</p>
<p>51.<em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “I must tell myself most clearly: does <em>He</em> use the image of a child that lives in every man’s soul? Were Horus, Tages, and Christ not children? Dionysus and Heracles were also divine children. Did Christ, the God of man, not call himself the <em>son</em> of man? What was his innermost thought in doing so? Should the <em>daughter of man</em> be God’s name?” (p. 9).</p>
<p>52.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “How thick the earlier darkness was! How impetuous and how egotistic my passion was, subjugated by all the daimons of ambition, the desire for glory, greed, uncharitableness, and zeal! How ignorant I was at the time! Life tore me away, and I deliberately moved away from you and I have done so for all these years. I recognize how good all of this was. But I thought that you were lost, even though I sometimes thought that I was lost. But you were not lost. I went on the way of the day. You went invisibly with me and guided me step by step, putting the pieces together meaningfully” (pp. 20–21).</p>
<p>53.In 1912, Jung endorsed Maeder’s notion of the prospective function of the dream (“An attempt at an account of psychoanalytic theory,” <em>CW</em> 4, §452). In a discussion in the Zürich Psychoanalytical Society on January 31, 1913, Jung said: “The dream is not only the fulfillment of infantile desires, but also symbolizes the future . . . The dream provides the answer through the symbol, which one must understand” (<em>MZS</em>, p. 5). On the development of Jung’s dream theory, see my <em>Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology: The Dream of a Science</em>, §2.</p>
<p>54.This echoes Blaise Pascal’s famous statement, “The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing” (<em>Pensées</em>, 423 [London: Penguin, 1660/1995], p. 127). Jung’s copy of Pascal’s work contains a number of marginal marks.</p>
<p>55.In 1912, Jung argued that scholarliness was insufficient if one wanted to become a “knower of the human soul.” To do this, one had to “hang up exact science and put away the scholar’s gown, to say farewell to his study and wander with human heart through the world, through the horror of prisons, mad houses and hospitals, through drab suburban pubs, in brothels and gambling dens, through the salons of elegant society, the stock exchanges, the socialist meetings, the churches, the revivals and ecstasies of the sects, to experience love, hate and passion in every form in one’s body” (“New paths of psychology,” <em>CW</em> 7, §409).</p>
<p>56.In 1931, Jung commented on the pathogenic consequences of the unlived life of parents upon their children: “What usually has the strongest psychic effect on the child is the life which the parents . . . have not lived. This statement would be rather too perfunctory and superficial if we did not add by way of qualification: that part of their lives which might have been lived had not certain somewhat threadbare excuses prevented the parents from doing so” (“Introduction to Frances Wickes, ‘Analyse der Kinderseele,’ ” <em>CW</em> 17, §87).</p>
<p>57.In the 1925 seminar, Jung explained his thoughts at this time: “These ideas about the anima and animus led me ever further afield into metaphysical problems, and more things crept up for reexamination. At that time I was on the Kantian basis that there were things that could never be solved and that therefore should not be speculated about, but it seemed to me that if I could find such definite ideas about the anima, it was quite worthwhile to try to formulate a conception of God. But I could arrive at nothing satisfactory and thought for a time that perhaps the anima figure was the deity. I said to myself that perhaps men had had a female God originally, but growing tired of being governed by women, they had then overthrown this God. I practically threw the whole metaphysical problem into the anima and conceived of it as the dominating spirit of psyche. In this way I got into a psychological argument with myself about the problem of God” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, p. 50).</p>
<p>58.In 1940, Jung presented a study of the motif of the divine child, in a collaborative volume with the Hungarian classicist Karl Kérenyi (see “On the psychology of the child archetype,” <em>CW</em> 9, 1). Jung wrote that the child motif occurs frequently in the individuation process. It does not represent one’s literal childhood, as is emphasized by its mythological nature. It compensates the onesidedness of consciousness and paves the way for the future development of the personality. In certain conditions of conflict, the unconscious psyche produces a symbol that unites the opposites. The child is such a symbol. It anticipates the self, which is produced through the synthesis of the conscious and unconscious elements of the personality. The typical fates that befall the child indicate the kind of psychic events accompanying the genesis of the self. The wonderful birth of the child indicates that this happens psychically as opposed to physically.</p>
<p>59.In 1940, Jung wrote: “an essential aspect of the child motif is its futural character. The child is potential future” (“On the psychology of the child archetype,” <em>CW</em> 9, 1, §278).</p>
<p>60.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “My friends, as you can see, mercy is granted to the developed, not the childish. I thank my God for this message. Do not let the teachings of Christianity deceive you! Its teachings are good for the most mature minds of bygone time. Today, it serves immature minds. Christianity no longer promises us grace, and yet we still need mercy. That which I tell you is the way of what is to come, my way to mercy” (p. 27).</p>
<p>61.I.e., Christ. Cf. Jung, “Transformation symbolism in the mass” (1942, <em>CW</em> 11).</p>
<p>62.In <em>Answer to Job</em> Jung noted: “Through the indwelling of the third divine person in man, namely the Holy Ghost, a christification of the many arises” (1952, <em>CW</em> 11, §758).</p>
<p>63.November 15, 1913.</p>
<p>64.In <em>Black Book 2</em>, Jung wrote down here the two pivotal dreams he had when he was nineteen years old which led him to turn to natural science (p. 13f); they are described in <em>Memories</em>, p. 105f.</p>
<p>65.In <em>Black Book 2,</em> Jung noted here: “Here, someone stands beside me and whispers terrible things into my ear: ‘You write to be printed and circulated among people. You want to cause a stir through the unusual. Nietzsche did this better than you. You are imitating Saint Augustine’ ” (p. 20). The reference is to Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em> (400 CE), a devotional work written when he was forty-five years old, in which he narrates his conversion to Christianity in an autobiographical form (<em>Confessions</em>, tr. H. Chadwick [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991]). The <em>Confessions</em> are addressed to God, and recount the years of his wandering from God and the manner of his return. Echoing this in the opening sections of <em>Liber Novus</em>, Jung addresses his soul and recounts the years of his wandering away from her, and the manner of his return. In his published works, Jung frequently cited Augustine, and referred to his <em>Confessions</em> several times in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>.</p>
<p>66.The first letter of John: “God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him” (1 John 4:16).</p>
<p>67.Christ was tempted by the devil for forty days in the desert (Luke 4:1–13).</p>
<p>68.Matthew 21:18-20 : “Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!” In 1944 Jung wrote: “The Christian—my Christian—knows no curse formulas; indeed he does not even sanction the cursing of the innocent fig-tree by the rabbi Jesus” (“Why I have not adopted the ‘Catholic truth’?” <em>CW</em> 18, §1468).</p>
<p>69.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “They may serve for your redemption” (p. 34).</p>
<p>70.In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche wrote: “And even when one has all the virtues, there is still one thing to remember: to send even these virtues to sleep at the proper time” (“Of the chairs of virtue,” p. 56). In 1939 Jung commented on the Eastern notion of liberation from virtues and vices (“Commentary to the ‘Tibetan Book of Great Liberation,’ ” <em>CW</em> 11, §826).</p>
<p>71.November 22, 1913. In <em>Black Book 2</em>, this sentence reads “says a voice” (p. 22). On November 21 Jung had given a presentation to the Zürich Psychoanalytical Society on “Formulations on the psychology of the unconscious.”</p>
<p>72.November 28, 1913.</p>
<p>73.<em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “I hear the words: ‘An anchorite in his own desert.’ The monks in the Syrian desert occur to me” (p. 33).</p>
<p>74.<em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “I think of Christianity in the desert. Physically, those ancients went into the desert. Did they also enter into the desert of their own self? Or was their self not as barren and desolate as mine? There they wrestled with the devil. I wrestle with waiting. It seems to me not less since it is truly a hot hell” (p. 35).</p>
<p>75.Around 285, St. Anthony went to live as a hermit in the Egyptian desert, and other hermits followed, whom he and Pachomius organized into a community. This formed the basis of Christian monasticism, which spread to the Palestinian and Syrian deserts. In the fourth century, there were thousands of monks in the Egyptian desert.</p>
<p>76.John 1:1: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”</p>
<p>77.December 11, 1913.</p>
<p>78.In “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’ ” (1929), Jung criticized the Western tendency to turn everything into methods and intentions. The cardinal lesson, as presented by the Chinese texts and by Meister Eckhart, was that of allowing psychic events to happen of their own accord: “Letting things happen, the action through non-action, the ‘letting go of oneself’ of Meister Eckhart, became the key for me that succeeded in opening the door to the way: One must be able to psychically let things happen” (<em>CW</em> 13, §20).</p>
<p>79.Christ preached: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 5:3). In a number of Christian communities, members take a vow of poverty. In 1934, Jung wrote: “Just as in Christianity the vow of worldly poverty turned the mind away from the riches of this earth, so spiritual poverty seeks to renounce the false riches of the spirit in order to withdraw not only from the sorry remnants—which today call themselves the protestant ‘churches’—of a great past, but also from all the allurements of exotic aromas; in order, finally, to turn back to itself, where, in the cold light of consciousness, the blank barrenness of the world reaches to the very stars” (“On the archetypes of the collective unconscious,” <em>CW</em> 9, 1, §29).</p>
<p>80.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “This, too, is an image of the ancients, that they lived in things symbolically: they renounced wealth in order to have a share of the voluntary poverty of their souls. Therefore I had to grant my soul my most extreme poverty and need. And the scorn of my cleverness rose up against this” (p. 47).</p>
<p>81.December 12 1913. The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: <em>“IV The Mystery Play. First Night.”</em> (p. 34). <em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “The battle of late was the battle with scorn. A vision that caused me three sleepless nights and three days of torment has likened me to G. Keller’s druggist of Chamounix (from start to finish). I know and acknowledge this style. I have learned that one must give one’s heart to men, but one’s intellect to the spirit of humanity, God. Then His work can be beyond vanity, since there is no more hypocritical whore than the intellect when it replaces the heart” (p. 41). Gottfried Keller (1819–1890) was a Swiss writer. See “Der Apotheker von Chamounix: Ein Buch Romanzen,” in Gottfried Keller, <em>Gesammelte Gedichte: Erzählungen aus dem Nachlass</em> (Zürich: Artemis Verlag, 1984), pp. 351–417.</p>
<p>82.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “A dwarf clad entirely in leather stood before it, minding the entrance” (p. 48).</p>
<p>83.The <em>Corrected</em> <em>Draft</em> continues: “The stone must be conquered, it is the stone of the torment, of the red light” (p. 35). The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “It is a six-sided crystal that gives off a cold, reddish light” (p. 35). Albrecht Dieterich refers to the representation of the underworld in Aristophanes’ <em>The Frogs</em> (which he understood to be of Orphic origin) as having a large lake and a place with serpents (<em>Nekyia: Beiträge zur Erklärung der neuentdeckten Petrusapokalypse</em> [Leipzig: Teubner, 1893], p. 71). Jung underlined these motifs in his copy. Dieterich referred to his description again on page 83, which Jung marked by the margin, and underlined “Darkness and Mud.” Dieterich also referred to an Orphic representation of a stream of mud in the underworld (p. 81). In his list of references in the back of his copy, Jung noted, “81 Mud.”</p>
<p>84.<em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “This dark hole—I want to know where it leads and what it says? An oracle? Is it the place of Pythia?” (p. 43).</p>
<p>85.Jung narrated this episode in his 1925 seminar, stressing different details. He commented: “When I came out of the fantasy, I realized that my mechanism had worked wonderfully well, but I was in great confusion as to the meaning of all those things I had seen. The light in the cave from the crystal was, I thought, like the stone of wisdom. The secret murder of the hero I could not understand at all. The beetle of course I knew to be an ancient sun symbol, and the setting sun, the luminous red disk, was archetypal. The serpents I thought might have been connected with Egyptian material. I could not then realize that it was all so archetypal, I need not seek connections. I was able to link the picture up with the sea of blood I had previously fantasized about. / Though I could not then grasp the significance of the hero killed, soon after I had a dream in which Siegfried was killed by myself. It was a case of destroying the hero ideal of my efficiency. This has to be sacrificed in order that a new adaptation can be made; in short, it is connected with the sacrifice of the superior function in order to get at the libido necessary to activate the inferior functions” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, p. 52f). (The killing of Siegfried occurs below in ch. 7.) Jung also anonymously cited and discussed this fantasy in his <em>ETH</em> lecture on June 14, 1935 (<em>Modern Psychology, vols. 1. and 2</em>, p. 223).</p>
<p>86.In the <em>Corrected Draft</em>, “science” is deleted (p. 37).</p>
<p>87.In the <em>Corrected Draft</em>, “more blessed” is substituted (p. 38).</p>
<p>88.In the <em>Corrected Draft</em>, this sentence is substituted by: “Madness grows” (p. 38).</p>
<p>89.The theme of divine madness has a long history. Its locus classicus was Socrates’s discussion of it in the <em>Phaedrus</em>: madness, “provided it comes as a gift of heaven, is the channel by which we receive the greatest blessings” (Plato, <em>Phaedrus and Letters VII and VIII</em>, tr. W. Hamilton [London: Penguin, 1986], p. 46, line 244). Socrates distinguished four types of divine madness: (1) inspired divination, such as by the prophetess at Delphi; (2) instances in which individuals, when ancient sins have given rise to troubles, have prophesied and incited to prayer and worship; (3) possession by the Muses, since the technically skilled untouched by the madness of the Muses will never be a good poet; and (4) the lover. In the Renaissance, the theme of divine madness was taken up by the Neoplatonists such as Ficino and by humanists such as Erasmus. Erasmus’s discussion is particularly important, as it fuses the classical Platonic conception with Christianity. For Erasmus, Christianity was the highest type of inspired madness. Like Plato, Erasmus differentiated between two types of madness: “Thus as long as the soul uses its bodily organs aright, a man is called sane; but truly, when it bursts its chains and tries to be free, practising running away from its prison, then one calls it insanity. If this happens through disease or a defect of the organs, then by common consent it is, plainly, insanity. And yet men of this kind, too, we find foretelling things to come, knowing tongues and writings which they had never studied beforehand—altogether showing forth something divine” (<em>In Praise of Folly</em>, tr. M. A. Screech [London: Penguin, 1988], pp. 128–29). He adds that if insanity “happens through divine fervor, it may not be the same kind of insanity, but it is so like it that most people make no distinction.” For lay people, the two forms of insanity appeared the same. The happiness that Christians sought was “nothing other than a certain kind of madness.” Those who experience this “experience something which is very like madness. They speak incoherently and unnaturally, utter sound without sense, and their faces suddenly change expression . . . in fact they are truly beside themselves” (ibid., pp. 129–33). In 1815, the philosopher F.W.J. Schelling discussed divine madness in a manner that has a certain proximity to Jung’s discussion, noting that “The ancients did not speak in vain of a divine and holy madness.” Schelling related this to the “inner self-laceration of nature.” He held that “nothing great can be accomplished without a constant solicitation of madness, which should always be overcome, but should never be entirely lacking.” On the one hand, there were sober spirits in whom there was no trace of madness, together with men of understanding who produced cold intellectual works. On the other, “there is one kind of person that governs madness and precisely in this overwhelming shows the highest force of the intellect. The other kind of person is governed by madness and is someone who is really mad” (<em>The Ages of the World</em>, tr. J. Wirth [Albany: SUNY Press, 2000], pp. 102–4).</p>
<p>90.An application of William James’s notion of the pragmatic rule. Jung read James’s <em>Pragmatism</em> in 1912, and it had a strong impact on his thinking. In his foreword to his Fordham University lectures, Jung stated that he had taken James’s pragmatic rule as his guiding principle (<em>CW</em> 4, p. 86). See my <em>Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology: The Dream of a Science</em>, pp. 57–61.</p>
<p>91.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The spirit of the depths was so alien to me that it took me twenty-five nights to comprehend him. And even then he was still so alien that I could neither see nor ask. He had to come to me as a stranger from far away and from an unheard-of side. He had to call me. I could not address him, knowing him and his nature. He announced himself with a loud voice, as in a warlike turmoil with the manifold clamoring of the voices of this time. The spirit of this time arose in me against this stranger, and uttered a battle cry together with his many serfs. I heard the noise of this battle in the air. Then the spirit of the depths burst forth and led me to the site of the innermost. But he had reduced the spirit of this time to a dwarf who was clever and bustling, yet was a dwarf. And the vision showed me the spirit of this time as made of leather, that is, pressed together, sere and lifeless. He could not prevent me from entering the dark underworld of the spirit of the depths. To my astonishment I realized that my feet sank into the black muddy water of the river of death. [The <em>Corrected Draft</em> adds: “for that is where death is,” p. 41] The mystery of the shining red crystal was my next destination” (pp. 54–55).</p>
<p>92.<em>The Draft</em> continues: “My soul is my supreme meaning, my image of God, neither God himself nor the supreme meaning. God becomes apparent in the supreme meaning of the human community” (p. 58).</p>
<p>93.In “Transformation symbolism in the mass,” (1942), Jung commented on the motif of the identity of the sacrificer and the sacrificed, with particular reference to the visions of Zosimos of Panapolis, a natural philosopher and alchemist of the third century. Jung noted: “What I sacrifice is my egotistical claim, and by doing this I give up myself. Every sacrifice is therefore, to a greater or lesser degree, a self-sacrifice” (<em>CW</em> 11, §397). Cf. also the Katha Upanishad, ch. 2, verse 19. Jung cited the next two verses of the Katha Upanishad on the nature of the self in 1921 (<em>CW</em> 6, §329). There is a line in the margin of Jung’s copy by these verses in the <em>Sacred Books of the East</em>, vol. XV, pt. 2, p. 11. In “Dreams,” Jung noted in connection with a dream “My intensive unconscious relation to India in the Red Book” (p. 9).</p>
<p>94.Jung elaborated the theme of collective guilt in “After the catastrophe” (1945, <em>CW</em> 10).</p>
<p>95.The reference is to the events of World War I. The autumn of 1914 (when Jung wrote this section of “layer two” ) saw the battle of the Marne and the first battle of Ypres.</p>
<p>96.In his lecture at the <em>ETH</em> on June 14, 1935, Jung commented (partially in reference to this fantasy, which he referred to anonymously): “The sun motif appears in many places and times and the meaning is always the same—that a new consciousness has been born. It is the light of illumination which is projected into space. This is a psychological event; the medical term ‘hallucination’ makes no sense in psychology. / The Katabasis plays a very important role in the Middle Ages and the old masters conceived of the rising sun in this Katabasis as of a new light, the lux moderna, the jewel, the lapis” (<em>Modern Psychology</em>, p. 231).</p>
<p>97.<em>The Draft</em> continues: “My friends, I know that I speak in riddles. But the spirit of the depths has granted me a view of many things in order to help my weak comprehension. I want to tell you more about my visions so that you better understand which things the spirit of the depths would like you to see. May those be well who can see these things! Those who cannot must live them as blind fate, in images” (p. 61).</p>
<p>98.In <em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious</em> (1927), Jung refers to the destructive and anarchic aspects that are constellated in societies being enacted by prophetically inclined individuals though spectacular crimes such as regicide (<em>CW</em> 7, §240).</p>
<p>99.Political assassinations were frequent at the beginning of the twentieth century. The particular event referred to here is the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Martin Gilbert describes this event, which played a critical role in the events that led to the outbreak of the First World War, as “a turning point in the history of the twentieth century” (<em>A History of the Twentieth Century: Volume One: 1900–1933</em> [London: William Morrow, 1977], p. 308).</p>
<p>100.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “When I was aspiring to my highest worldly power, the spirit of the depths sent me nameless thoughts and visions, that wiped out the heroic aspiration in me as our time understands it” (p. 62).</p>
<p>101.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Everything that we have forgotten will be revived, each human and divine passion, the black serpents and the reddish sun of the depths” (p. 64).</p>
<p>102.On June 9, 1917, there was a discussion on the psychology of the world war in the Association for Analytical Psychology following a presentation by Jules Vodoz on the <em>Song of Roland</em>. Jung argued that “Hypothetically, the World War can be raised to the subjective level. In detail, the authoritarian principle (taking action on the basis of principles) clashes with the emotional principle. The collective unconscious enters into allegiance with the emotional.” Concerning the hero, he said: “The hero—the beloved figure of the people, should fall. All heroes bring themselves down by carrying the heroic attitude beyond a certain limit, and hence lose their footing” (<em>MAP</em>, vol. 2, p. 10). The psychological interpretation of the First World War on the subjective level describes what is developed in this chapter. The connection between individual and collective psychology which he articulates here forms one of the leitmotifs of his later work (cf. <em>Present and Future</em> [1957], <em>CW</em> 10).</p>
<p>103.December 16, 1913. In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, Nietzsche wrote: “Anyone who fights with monsters should take care that he does not in the process become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes back into you” (tr. Marion Faber [Oxford: Oxford University Press], 1998, §146, p. 68).</p>
<p>104.<em>Black Book 2</em> continues: “Are you neurotic? Are we neurotic?” (p. 53).</p>
<p>105.See note 99, p. 155.</p>
<p>106.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “My friends, if you knew what depths of the future you carry inside you! Those who look into their own depths, look at what is to come” (p. 70).</p>
<p>107.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “But just as Judas is a necessary link in the chain of the work of redemption, so is our Judas betrayal of the hero also a necessary passageway to redemption” (p. 71). In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung discussed the view of the Abbé Oegger, in Anatole France’s story <em>Le jardin d’Épicure</em>, who maintained that God had chosen Judas as an instrument to complete Christ’s work of redemption (<em>CW</em> B, §52).</p>
<p>108.Cf. Leviticus 16:7–10: “And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord’s lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.”</p>
<p>109.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “this is what the ancients taught us” (p. 72).</p>
<p>110.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Those who wander in the desert experience everything that belongs to the desert. The ancients have described this to us. From them we can learn. Open the ancient books and learn what will come to you in solitude. Everything will be given to you and you will be spared nothing, the mercy and the torment” (p. 72).</p>
<p>111.This refers to the mourning for the death of the hero.</p>
<p>112.December 18, 1913. <em>Black Book 2</em> has: “The following night was terrible. I soon awoke from a frightful dream” (p. 56). The <em>Draft</em> has: “a mighty dream vision rose from the depths” (p. 73).</p>
<p>113.Siegfried was a heroic prince who appears in old German and Norse epics. In the twelfth-century <em>Niebelunglied</em>, he is described as follows: “And in what magnificent style Siegfried rode! He bore a great spear, stout of shaft and broad of head; his handsome sword reached down to his spurs; and the fine horn which this lord carried was of the reddest gold” (tr. A. Hatto [London: Penguin, 2004], p. 129). His wife, Brunhild, is tricked into revealing the only place where he could be wounded and killed. Wagner reworked these epics in <em>The Ring of the</em> <em>Niebelung</em>. In 1912, in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>, Jung presented a psychological interpretation of Siegfried as a symbol of the libido, principally citing Wagner’s libretto of <em>Siegfried</em> (<em>CW</em> B, §568f).</p>
<p>114.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “After this dream vision” (p. 73).</p>
<p>115.In <em>Black Book 2</em>, Jung noted: “I strode light-footedly up an incredibly steep path and later helped my wife, who followed me at a slower pace, to ascend. Some people mocked us, but I didn’t mind, since this showed that they didn’t know that I had murdered the hero” (p. 57). Jung recounted this dream in the 1925 seminar, stressing different details. He preceded it with the following remarks: “Siegfried was not an especially sympathetic figure to me, and I don’t know why my unconscious got engrossed in him. Wagner’s Siegfried, especially, is exaggeratedly extraverted and at times actually ridiculous. I never liked him. Nevertheless the dream showed him to be my hero. I could not understand the strong emotion I had with the dream.” After narrating the dream, Jung concluded: “I felt an enormous pity for him [Siegfried], as though I myself had been shot. I must then have had a hero I did not appreciate, and it was my ideal of force and efficiency I had killed. I had killed my intellect, helped on to the deed by a personification of the collective unconscious, the little brown man with me. In other words, I deposed my superior function . . . The rain that fell is a symbol of the release of tension; that is, the forces of the unconscious are loosed. When this happens, the feeling of relief is engendered. The crime is expiated because, as soon as the main function is deposed, there is a chance for other sides of the personality to be born into life” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, pp. 61–62). In <em>Black Book 2</em>, and in his later remarks about this dream in <em>Memories</em> (p. 204), Jung said that he felt that he would have to kill himself if he could not solve this riddle.</p>
<p>116.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “and I fell asleep again. A second dream vision rose in me” (pp. 73–74).</p>
<p>117.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “These lights pervaded my mind and senses. And once again I fell asleep like a convalescent” (p. 74). Jung recounted this dream to Aniela Jaffé, and commented that after he had been confronted with the shadow, as in the Siegfried dream, this dream expressed the idea that he was one thing and something else at the same time. The unconscious reached beyond one, like a saint’s halo. The shadow was like the light-colored sphere that surrounded the people. He thought this was a vision of the beyond, where men are complete. (<em>MP,</em> p. 170).</p>
<p>118.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The world in-between is a world of the simplest things. It is not a world of intention and imperatives, but a perchance-world with indefinite possibilities. Here the next ways are all small, no broad, straight highroads, no Heaven above them, no Hell beneath” (p. 74). In October of 1916, Jung gave some talks to the Psychological Club, “Adaptation, individuation, and collectivity,” in which he commented on the importance of guilt: “the first step in individuation is tragic guilt. The accumulation of guilt demands expiation” (<em>CW</em> 18, §1094).</p>
<p>119.The <em>Draft</em> has here, in addition: “Are you smiling? The spirit of this time would want to make you believe that the depths are no world and no reality” (p. 74).</p>
<p>120.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “a Judas” (p. 75).</p>
<p>121.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “My dream vision showed me that I was not alone when I committed the deed. I was helped by a youth, that is, one who was younger than me; a rejuvenated version of myself” (p. 76).</p>
<p>122.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Siegfried had to die, just like Wotan” (p. 76). In 1918, Jung wrote of the effects of the introduction of Christianity into Germany: “Christianity split the Germanic barbarian into his upper and lower halves and enabled him, by repressing the dark side, to domesticate the brighter half and fit it for culture. But the lower, darker half still awaits redemption and a second domestication. Until then, it will remain associated with vestiges of prehistory, with the collective unconscious, which must indicate a peculiar and increasing activation of the collective unconscious” (“On the unconscious,” <em>CW</em> 10, §17). He expanded on this situation in “Wotan” (1936, <em>CW</em> 10).</p>
<p>123.In the <em>Draft</em>, this sentence reads: “We want to continue living with a new God, a hero beyond Christ” (p. 76). To Aniela Jaffé, he recounted that he had thought of himself as an overcoming hero, but the dream indicated that the hero had to be killed. This exaggeration of the will was represented by the Germans at that time, such as by the Siegfried line. A voice within him said, “If you do not understand the dream, you must shoot yourself!” (<em>MP</em>, p. 98, <em>Memories</em>, p. 204) The original Siegfried line was a defensive line established by the Germans in northern France in 1917 (this was actually a subsection of the Hindenburg Line).</p>
<p>124.The theme of the dying and resurrecting God features prominently in James Frazer’s <em>The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion</em> (London: Macmillan, 1911–15), which Jung drew upon in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912).</p>
<p>125.December 20, 1913. A reference to Christ’s parable of the mustard seed. Matthew 13:31-32: “The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree” (Cf. Luke 13:18–20, Mark 4:30–32).</p>
<p>126.In Mark 16:17, Christ stated that those who believe shall speak with new tongues. The issue of speaking in tongues is discussed in 1 Corinthians 14, and is central in the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>127.The theme of self-overcoming is an important one in the work of Nietzsche. In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche writes: “I teach you the Superman. Man is something that should be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All creatures hitherto have created something beyond themselves: <em>and do you want to be the ebb of this great tide, and return to the animals rather than overcome man?</em> (“Zarathustra’s prologue 3,” p. 41; underlined as in Jung’s copy). For Jung’s discussion of this theme in Nietzsche, see Nietzsche’s <em>Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1934–9</em>, vol. 2, ed. James Jarrett (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988, pp. 1502–8).</p>
<p>128.Judas betrayed Christ for thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26:14–16).</p>
<p>129.See note 58, p. 136.</p>
<p>130.This conception of the encompassing nature of the new God is fully developed further ahead in <em>Scrutinies</em> (Sermon 2, p. 516f).</p>
<p>131.The theme of the integration of evil into the Godhead played an important role in Jung’s works; see <em>Aion</em> (1951, <em>CW</em> 9, 2, ch. 5), and <em>Answer to Job</em> (1952, <em>CW</em> 11).</p>
<p>132.The conception of the absolute idea was developed by Hegel. He understood it as the culmination and the self-differentiating unity of the dialectical sequence that gives rise to the cosmos. Cf. <em>Hegel’s Logic</em> (tr. W. Wallace [London: Thames and Hudson, 1975]). Jung refers to this in 1921 in <em>Psychological Types</em> (<em>CW</em> 6, §735).</p>
<p>133.This sentence is cut in the <em>Corrected Draft</em> and replaced with “but this can be guessed:” (p. 68).</p>
<p>134.1 Peter 4:6 states: “For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.”</p>
<p>135.The theme of Christ’s descent into Hell features in several apocryphal gospels. In the “Apostles Creed,” it is stated that “He descended into Hell. The third day He arose again from the dead.” Jung commented on the appearance of this motif in medieval alchemy (<em>Psychology and Alchemy</em>, 1944, <em>CW</em> 12, §61n, 440, 451; <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em>, 1955/56, <em>CW</em> 14, 475). One of the sources which Jung referred to (<em>CW</em> 12, §61n) was Albrecht Dieterich’s <em>Nekyia:</em> <em>Beiträge zur Erklärung der neuentdeckten Petrusapokalypse</em>, which commented on an apocalyptic fragment from the Gospel of St. Peter, in which Christ gives a detailed description of Hell. Jung’s copy of this work has numerous markings in the margins, and in the rear are two additional pieces of paper with a list of page references and remarks. In 1951 he gave the following psychological interpretation of the motif of Christ’s descent into Hell: “The scope of the integration is suggested by the ‘descensus ad infernos,’ the descent of Christ’s soul to Hell, whose work of redemption also encompasses the dead. The psychological equivalent of this forms the integration of the collective unconscious which represents an essential part of the individuation process” (<em>Aion, CW</em> 9, 2, §72). In 1938 he noted: “The three days descent into Hell during death describes the sinking of the vanished value into the unconscious, where, by conquering the power of darkness, it establishes a new order, and then rises up to heaven again, that is, attains supreme clarity of consciousness” (“Psychology and religion,” <em>CW</em> 11, §149). The “unknown books of the ancients” refer to the apocryphal gospels.</p>
<p>136.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “But the serpent is also life. In the image furnished by the ancients, the serpent put an end to the childlike magnificence of paradise; they even said that Christ himself had been a serpent” (p. 83). Jung commented on this motif in 1950 in <em>Aion, CW</em> 9, 2, §291.</p>
<p>137.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “a beginning of Hell” (p. 70). In 1933 Jung recalled: “At the outbreak of war I was in Inverness, and I returned through Holland and Germany. I came right through the armies going west, and I had the feeling that it was what one would call in German a <em>Hochzeitsstimmung</em>, a feast of love all over the country. Everything was decorated with flowers, it was an outburst of love, they all loved each other and everything was beautiful. Yes, the war was important, a big affair, but the main thing was the brotherly love all over the country, everybody was everybody else’s brother, one could have everything anyone possessed, it did not matter. The peasants threw open their cellars and handed out what they had. That happened even in the restaurant and buffet at the railroad station. I was very hungry, I had had nothing to eat for about twenty-four hours, and they had some sandwiches left, and when I asked what they cost, they said, ‘Oh nothing, just take them!’ And when I first crossed the border into Germany, we were led into an enormous tent full of beer and sausages and bread and cheese, and we paid nothing, it was one great feast of love. I was absolutely bewildered” (<em>Visions Seminars</em> 2, ed. Claire Douglas [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997], pp. 974–75).</p>
<p>138.The phrase “Soul murderer” had been used by Luther and Zwingli, and more recently by Daniel Paul Schreber in his 1903 <em>Memoirs of my Nervous Illness</em>, eds. and tr. Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter (Folkestone: William Dawson, 1955). Jung discussed this work in 1907 in “On the psychology of dementia praecox” (<em>CW</em> 3), and drew Freud’s attention to it. In discussions concerning Schreber in the Association for Analytical Psychology on July 9 and 16 of 1915 following presentations by Schneiter, Jung drew attention to Gnostic parallels to Schreber’s imagery (<em>MAP</em>, vol. 1., p. 88f).</p>
<p>139.The reference is to the carnage of World War I.</p>
<p>140.This refers back to the vision in chapter 5, “Descent into Hell in the Future.” In 1940 Jung wrote: “the threat to one’s inmost self from dragons and serpents points to the danger of the newly acquired consciousness being swallowed up again by the instinctive soul, the unconscious” (“On the psychology of the child archetype,” <em>CW</em> 9,1, §282).</p>
<p>141.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead “to an end” (p. 73).</p>
<p>142.In 1952, Jung wrote to Zwi Werblowsky concerning the intentional ambiguity of his writings: “The language I speak must be equivocal, that is, <em>ambiguous</em>, to do justice to psychic nature with its double aspect. I strive consciously and deliberately for ambiguous expressions, because it is superior to unequivocalness and corresponds to the nature of being” (<em>Letters</em> 2, pp. 70–71).</p>
<p>143.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Look at the images of the Gods that the ancients and the men of old left behind: their nature is ambiguous and equivocal” (p. 87).</p>
<p>144.I John 4:16: “God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.”</p>
<p>145.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Whoever reverses this word and others that I speak, is a player, since he doesn’t respect the spoken word. Know that you attain yourself from what you read in a book. You read as much into a book as out of it” (p. 88).</p>
<p>146.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has “birth of the new [conception of a] God” (p. 74).</p>
<p>147.The reference is to the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>148.See note 57, p. 135.</p>
<p>149.This seems to refer to the wounding of Izdubar in <em>Liber Secundus</em>, ch. 8, “First Day.” See below, p. 277f.</p>
<p>150.The importance of wholeness above perfection is an important theme in Jung’s later work. Cf. <em>Aion</em>, 1951, <em>CW</em> 9, 2, §123; <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis,</em> 1955/56, <em>CW</em> 14, §616.</p>
<p>151.In 1916, Jung wrote: “Man has one ability which, though it is of the greatest utility for collective purposes, is the most pernicious for individuation, and that is <em>imitation</em>. <em>Collective psychology can hardly dispense with imitation</em>” (“The structure of the unconscious,” <em>CW</em> 7, §463). In “On the psychology of the child archetype” (1940) Jung wrote about the danger of identifying with the hero: “This identity is often very extremely stubborn and dangerous for the equilibrium of the soul. If the identity can be dissolved, the figure of the hero, through the reduction of consciousness to a human level, can gradually be differentiated into a symbol of the self” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §303).</p>
<p>152.Jung dealt with the issue of the conflict between individuation and collectivity in 1916 in “Individuation and collectivity” (<em>CW</em> 18).</p>
<p>153.Cf. Jung’s comments in “Individuation and collectivity” that “The individual must now consolidate himself by cutting himself off from God and becoming wholly himself. Thereby and at the same time he also separates himself from society. Outwardly he plunges into solitude, but inwardly into Hell, distance from God” (<em>CW</em> 18, §1103).</p>
<p>154.This is an interpretation of the murder of Siegfried in <em>Liber Primus</em>, ch. 7, “Murder of the Hero.”</p>
<p>155.This refers to the dream mentioned in the prologue, p. 124.</p>
<p>156.December 21, 1913. In <em>Black Book</em> 2 Jung noted: “with a gray beard and wearing an Oriental robe” (p. 231).</p>
<p>157.Elijah was one of the prophets of the Old Testament. He first appears in 1 Kings 17, bearing a message from God to Ahab, the king of Israel. In 1953, the Carmelite Père Bruno wrote to Jung asking how one established the existence of an archetype. Jung replied by taking Elijah as an example, describing him as a highly mythical personage, which did not prevent him from probably being a historical figure. Drawing together descriptions of him throughout history, Jung described him as a “living archetype” who represented the collective unconscious and the self. He noted that such a constellated archetype gave rise to new forms of assimilation, and represented a compensation on the part of the unconscious (<em>CW</em> 18, §§1518–31).</p>
<p>158.Salome was the daughter of Herodias and the stepdaughter of King Herod. In Matthew 14 and Mark 6, John the Baptist had told King Herod that it was unlawful for him to be married to his brother’s wife, and Herod put him in prison. Salome (who is not named, but simply called the daughter of Herodias) danced before Herod on his birthday, and he promised to give her anything she wished for. She requested the head of John the Baptist, who was then beheaded. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the figure of Salome fascinated painters and writers, including Guillaume Apollinaire, Gustave Flaubert, Stéphane Mallarmé, Gustave Moreau, Oscar Wilde, and Franz von Stuck, featuring in many works. See Bram Dijkstra, <em>Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Siècle Culture</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 379–98.</p>
<p>159.<em>Black Book</em> 2 continues: “The crystal shines dimly. I think again of the image of Odysseus, how he passed the rocky island of the Sirens on his lengthy odyssey. Should I, should I not?” (p. 74).</p>
<p>160.I.e., the head of John the Baptist.</p>
<p>161.In the 1925 Seminar, Jung recounted: “I used the same technique of the descent, but this time I went much deeper. The first time I should say I reached a depth of about one thousand feet, but this time it was a cosmic depth. It was like going to the moon, or like the feeling of a descent into empty space. First the picture was of a crater, or a ring-chain of mountains, and my feeling association was that of one dead, as if oneself were a victim. It was the mood of the land of the hereafter. I could see two people, an old man with a white beard and a young girl who was very beautiful. I assumed them to be real and listened to what they were saying. The old man said he was Elijah and I was quite shocked, but she was even more upsetting because she was Salome. I said to myself that there was a queer mixture: Salome and Elijah, but Elijah assured me that he and Salome had been together since eternity. This also upset me. With them was a black serpent who had an affinity for me. I stuck to Elijah as being the most reasonable of the lot, for he seemed to have a mind. I was exceedingly doubtful about Salome. We had a long conversation but I did not understand it. Of course I thought of the fact of my father being a clergyman as being the explanation of my having figures like this. How about this old man then? Salome was not to be touched upon. It was only much later that I found her association with Elijah quite natural. Whenever you take journeys like this you find a young girl with an old man” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, pp. 68–69). Jung then refers to examples of this pattern in the work of Melville, Meyrink, Rider Haggard, and the Gnostic legend of Simon Magus (see note 154, p. 552), Kundry and Klingsor from Wagner’s <em>Parsifal</em> (see below, p. 363f), and Francesco Colonna’s <em>Hypnerotomachia</em>. In <em>Memories</em>, he noted: “In myths the snake is a frequent counterpart of the hero. There are numerous accounts of their affinity . . . Therefore the presence of the snake was an indication of a hero-myth” (p. 206). Of Salome, he said: “Salome is an anima figure, blind because, though connecting the conscious and the unconscious, she does not see the operation of the unconscious. Elijah is the personification of the cognitional element, Salome of the erotic. Elijah is the figure of the old prophet filled with wisdom. One could speak of these two figures as personifications of Logos and Eros very specifically shaped. This is practical for intellectual play, but as Logos and Eros are purely speculative terms, not scientific in any sense, but irrational, it is very much better to leave the figures as they are, namely as events, experiences” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, pp. 96–97). In 1955/56, Jung wrote: “For purely psychological reasons I have elsewhere attempted to equate the masculine consciousness with the concept of <em>Logos</em> and the feminine with that of <em>Eros</em>. By Logos I meant discrimination, judgment, insight, and by Eros I meant the placing into relation” (<em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em>, <em>CW</em> 14, §224). On Jung’s reading of Elijah and Salome in terms of Logos and Eros respectively, see Appendix B, “Commentaries.”</p>
<p>162.<em>The Corrected Draft</em> has: “<em>Guiding Reflection”</em> (p. 86). The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have “This, my friend, is a mystery play in which the spirit of the depths cast me. I had recognized the birth of the new God [the conception], and therefore the spirit of the depths allowed me to participate in the underworld ceremonies, which were supposed to instruct me about the God’s intentions and works. Through these rituals I was supposed to be initiated into the mysteries of redemption” (<em>Corrected Draft</em>, p. 86).</p>
<p>163.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “In the renewed world you can have no outer possessions, unless you create them out of yourselves. You can enter only into your own mysteries. The spirit of the depths has other things to teach you than me. I only have to bring you tidings of the new God and of the ceremonies and mysteries of his service. But this is the way. It is the gate to darkness” (p. 100).</p>
<p>164.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The mystery play took place at the deepest bottom of my interior, which is that other world. You have to bear this in mind, it is also a world and its reality is large and frightening. You cry and laugh and tremble and sometimes you break out in a cold sweat for fear of death. The mystery play represents my self and through me the world to which I belong is represented. Thus, my friends, you learn much about the world, and through it about yourself, by what I say to you here. But you have not learned anything about your mysteries in this way; indeed, your way is darker than before, since my example will stand obstructively in your path. You may follow me, not on my way, but on yours” (p. 102).</p>
<p>165.This depicts the scene in the fantasy.</p>
<p>166.This is a subjective interpretation of the figures of Elijah and Salome.</p>
<p>167.In the <em>Corrected Draft</em>, “Predetermination or forethought” is replaced by “The Idea.” This substitution occurs throughout the rest of this section (p. 89).</p>
<p>168.In Greek mythology, Prometheus created mankind out of clay. He could foretell the future, and his name signifies “forethought.” In 1921, Jung wrote an extended analysis of Carl Spitteler’s epic poem <em>Prometheus und Epimetheus</em> (1881) together with Goethe’s <em>Prometheus Fragment</em> (1773); see <em>Psychological Types</em>, <em>CW</em> 6, ch. 5.</p>
<p>169.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “Boundary” (p. 89).</p>
<p>170.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Therefore the forethinker approached me as Elijah, the prophet, and pleasure as Salome” (p. 103).</p>
<p>171.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The animal of deadly horror, which lay between Adam and Eve” (p. 105).</p>
<p>172.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> continues: “The serpent is not only a separating but also a unifying principle” (p. 91).</p>
<p>173.When commenting on this in the 1925 seminar, Jung noted that there were many accounts in mythology of the relation between a hero and a serpent, so the presence of the serpent indicated that “it will again be a hero myth” (p. 94). He showed a diagram of a cross with Rational/Thinking (Elijah) at the top, Feeling (Salome) at the bottom, Irrational / Intuition (Superior) at the left, and Sensation / Inferior (Serpent) at the right (p. 95). He interpreted the black serpent as the introverting libido: “The serpent leads the psychological movement apparently astray into the kingdom of shadows, dead and wrong images, but also into earth, into concretization . . . Inasmuch as the serpent leads into the shadows, it has the function of the anima; it leads you into the depths, it connects the Above and Below. . . the serpent is also the symbol of wisdom” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, pp. 102–3).</p>
<p>174.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “By following Elijah and Salome, I follow the two principles inside me and through me in the world, of which I am part” (p. 106).</p>
<p>175.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> continues: “that is, of thinking. And without thinking one cannot grasp an idea” (p. 92).</p>
<p>176.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “What would Odysseus have been without his wandering?” (p. 107). The <em>Corrected Draft</em> adds: “There would have been no odyssey” (p. 92).</p>
<p>177.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> continues: “Than much rather the pleasure to enjoy the garden” (p. 92).</p>
<p>178.The <em>Corrected Draf</em>t continues: “It is strange that Salome’s garden lies so close to the dignified and mysterious hall of ideas. Does a thinker therefore experience awe or perhaps even fear of the idea, because of its proximity to paradise?” (p. 92).</p>
<p>179.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “I was a forethinker. What could astonish me more than the intimate community of forethinking and pleasure, these inimical principles?” (p. 108).</p>
<p>180.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “One who has pleasure” (p. 94).</p>
<p>181.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “Pleasure” (p. 94).</p>
<p>182.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “Pleasure” (p. 94).</p>
<p>183.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “as one of your poets has said: ‘the shaft bears two irons’ ” (p. 110).</p>
<p>184.In 1913, Jung presented his paper “On the question of psychological types,” in which he noted that the libido or psychic energy in an individual was characteristically directed toward the object (extraversion) or toward the subject (introversion); <em>CW</em> 6. Commencing in the summer of 1915 he had extensive correspondence with Hans Schmid on this question, in which he now characterized the introverts as being dominated by the function of thinking, and the extraverts as being dominated by the function of feeling. He also characterized the extraverts as being dominated by the pleasure-pain mechanism, seeking out the love of the object, and unconsciously seeking tyrannical power. Introverts unconsciously sought inferior pleasure, and had to see that the object was also a symbol of their pleasure. On August 7, 1915, he wrote to Schmid: “<em>The opposites should be evened out in the individual himself</em>” (<em>The Question of Psychological Types</em>, forthcoming). This linkage between thinking and introversion and feeling and extraversion was maintained in his discussion of this subject in 1917 in <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes</em>. In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), this model had expanded to encompass two main attitude types of introverts and extraverts further subdivided by the predominance of one of the four psychological functions of thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition.</p>
<p>185.December 22, 1913. On December 19, 1913, Jung gave a talk “On the psychology of the unconscious” to the Zürich Psychoanalytical Society.</p>
<p>186.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Kali” (p. 113).</p>
<p>187.<em>Black Book</em> 2 continues: “now that white shape of a girl with black hair—my own soul—and now that white shape of a man, which also appeared to me at the time—it resembles Michelangelo’s sitting Moses—it is Elijah” (p. 84). Michelangelo’s Moses is in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. It was the subject of a study by Freud that was published in 1914 (<em>The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</em>, ed. James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson, tr. J. Strachey, 24 vols. [London: The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-analysis, 1953–1974], vol. 13). The third-person pronoun “it” identifies Salome with Kali, whose many hands wring each other; cf. note 196, p. 190.</p>
<p>188.Jung mentioned this conversation in the 1925 seminar and commented: “Only then I learned psychological objectivity. Only then could I say to a patient, ‘Be quiet, something is happening.’ There <em>are</em> such things as mice in a house. You cannot say you are wrong when you have a thought. For the understanding of the unconscious we must see our thoughts as events, as phenomena” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, p. 103).</p>
<p>189.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “Truth” (p. 100).</p>
<p>190.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “Guiding Reflection” (p. 103). In the <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em>, a lengthy passage occurs. What follows here is a paraphrase: I wonder whether this is real, an underworld, or the other reality, and whether it was the other reality that had forced me here. I see here that Salome, my pleasure, moves to the left, the side of the impure and bad. This movement follows the serpent, which represents the resistance and the enmity against this movement. Pleasure goes away from the door. Forethinking [<em>Corrected Draft</em>: “the Idea,” throughout this passage] stands at the door, knowing the entrance to the mysteries. Therefore desire melts into the many, if forethinking does not direct it and force it toward its goal. If one meets a man who only desires, then one will find resistance against his desire behind it. Desire without forethinking gains much but keeps nothing, therefore his desire is the source of constant disappointment. Thus Elijah calls Salome back. If pleasure is united with forethinking, the serpent lies before them. To succeed in something, you first need to deal with the resistance and difficulty, otherwise joy leaves behind pain and disappointment. Therefore I drew nearer. I had first to overcome the difficulty and the resistance to gain what I desired. When desire overcomes the difficulty, it becomes seeing and follows forethinking. Therefore I see that Salome’s hands are pure, with no trace of crime. My desire is pure if I first overcome the difficulty and resistance. If I weigh up pleasure and forethinking, I am like a fool, blindly following his longing. If I follow my thinking, I forsake my pleasure. The ancients said in images that the fool finds the right way. Forethinking has the first word, therefore Elijah asked me what I wanted. You should always ask yourself what you desire, since all too many do not know what they want. I did not know what I wanted. You should confess your longing and what you long for to yourself. Thus you satisfy your pleasure and nourish your forethinking at the same time (<em>Corrected Draft</em>, pp. 103–4).</p>
<p>191.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “in his outer appearance, in the misery of earthly reality” (p. 107).</p>
<p>192.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “the son of God” (p. 107).</p>
<p>193.Cf. Matthew 18:18. Christ: “Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”</p>
<p>194.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> continue: “The Pope in Rome has become an image and symbol for us of how God becomes human and how he [God] becomes the visible lord of men. Thus the coming God will become the lord of the world. This happens first [here] in me. The supreme meaning becomes my lord and infallible commander, though not only in me, but perhaps in many others whom I don’t know” (<em>Corrected Draft</em>, pp. 108–9).</p>
<p>195.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “thus I become, like the Buddha sitting in the flames” (p. 109).</p>
<p>196.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> continues: “Where the idea is, pleasure always is too. If the idea is inside, pleasure is outside. Therefore an air of evil pleasure envelops me. A lecherous and bloodthirsty Godhead gives me this false air. This happens because I must altogether suffer the becoming of the God and can therefore not separate it from myself at first. But as long as it is not separated from me, I am so seized by the idea that I am it, and therefore I am also the woman associated with the idea from the beginning. In that I receive the idea and represent it in the manner of Buddha, my pleasure is like the Indian Kali, since she is Buddha’s other side. Kali, however, is Salome and Salome is my soul” (p. 109).</p>
<p>197.In the <em>Draft</em>, a lengthy passage occurs here, a paraphrase of which follows: The numbness is like a death. I needed total transformation. Through this my meaning, like that of the Buddha, went completely inside. Then the transformation happened. I then went over to pleasure, as I was a thinker. As a thinker, I rejected my feeling, but I had rejected part of life. Then my feeling became a poisonous plant, and when it awakened, it was sensuality instead of pleasure, the lowest and commonest form of pleasure. This is represented by Kali. Salome is the image of his pleasure, that suffers pain, since it was shut out for too long. It then became apparent that Salome, i.e., my pleasure, was my soul. When I recognized this, my thinking changed and ascended to the idea, and then the image of Elijah appeared. This prepared me for the mystery play, and showed me in advance the way of transformation that I had to undergo in the Mysterium. The flowing together of the forethinking with pleasure produces the God. I recognized that the God in me wanted to become a man, and I considered this and honored this, and I became the servant of the God, but for no one other than myself. [<em>Corrected Draft</em>: it would be madness and presumption to assume that I also did this for others, p. 110]. I sank into the contemplation of the wonder of transformation, and first turned into the lower level of my pleasure, and then through this I recognized my soul. The smiles of Elijah and Salome indicate that they were happy at my appearance, but I was in deep darkness. When the way is dark, so is the idea that gives light. When the idea in the moment of confusion allows the words and not the blind longing, then the words lead you to difficulty. Whereas it leads you to the right. That is why Elijah turns left, to the side of the unholy and evil, and Salome turns right to the side of the correct and good. She doesn’t go to the garden, the place of pleasure, but remains in the house of the father (pp. 125–27).</p>
<p>198.In the <em>Draft</em>, a passage occurs, a paraphrase of which follows: If I am strong, so also are my intentions and presuppositions. My own thought weakens and goes over into the idea. The idea becomes strong; it is supported by its own strength. I recognize this in the fact that Elijah is supported by the lions. The lion is of stone. My pleasure is dead and turned to stone, because I did not love Salome. This gave my thought the coldness of stone, and from this the idea took its solidity, which it needed to subjugate my thought. It needed to be subjugated as it strove against Salome, since she appeared bad to it (p. 128).</p>
<p>199.In 1921 Jung wrote: “The peculiar reality of unconscious contents, therefore, gives us the same right to describe them as objects as outer things” (<em>Psychological Types</em>, CW 6, §280).</p>
<p>200.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have: “I would have to consider myself mad, [: It would be more than inconsistent,] if I thought that I had produced the thoughts of the Mysterium” (<em>Corrected Draft</em>, p. 115).</p>
<p>201.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “I recognized the father because I was a thinker, and thus I did not know the mother, but saw love in the guise of pleasure and called it pleasure, and therefore this was Salome to me. Now I learn that Mary is the mother, the innocent and love-receiving, and not pleasure, who bears the seed of evil in her heated and seductive nature. / If Salome, evil pleasure, is my sister, then I must be a thinking saint, and my intellect has met with a sad fate. I must sacrifice my intellect and confess to you that what I told you about pleasure, namely that it is the principle opposed to forethought, is incomplete and prejudiced. I observed as a thinker from the vantage point of my thinking, otherwise I could have recognized that Salome, as Elijah’s daughter, is an offspring of thought and not the principle itself, which Mary, the innocent Virgin Mother, now appears as” (p. 133).</p>
<p>202.The gospel of the Egyptians is one of the apocryphal gospels that features a dialogue between Christ and Salome. Christ states that he has come to undo the work of the female, namely, lust, birth, and decay. To Salome’s question of how long shall death prevail, Christ answered, as long as women bear children. Here, Jung is referring to the following passage: “she said, ‘Then I have done well in not giving birth,’ imagining that it is not permitted to bear children; the Lord answered, ‘Eat of every herb, but the bitter one eat not.’ ” The dialogue continues: “When Salome asked when it shall be made known the Lord said, ‘When you tread under foot the covering of shame and when out of two is made one, and the male with the female, neither male nor female’ ” (<em>The Apocryphal New Testament</em>, ed. J. K. Elliot [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999], p. 18). Jung cites this logion, available to him from Clement in the <em>Stromateis</em>, as an example of the union of opposites in <em>Visions</em> (1932, vol. 1., p. 524), and as an example of the coniunctio of male and female in “On the psychology of the child archetype” (1940, <em>CW</em> 9, 1, §295) and <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em> (1955–56, <em>CW</em> 14, §528).</p>
<p>203.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have: “but when the mystery play showed me this, I didn’t understand, but I thought I had produced an incredible thought. I am mad to believe this, And I believed it. Therefore I was seized by fear, and I wanted to explain my arbitrary thoughts to Elijah and Salome, and thus invalidate them” (<em>Corrected Draft</em>, p. 118).</p>
<p>204.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The image of the cool starry night and of the vast sky opens up my eye to the infinity of the inner world, which I as a desirous man feel is still too cold. I cannot pull the stars down to myself, but only watch them. Therefore my impetuous desire feels that that world is nightly and cold” (p. 135).</p>
<p>205.This depicts a scene in the fantasy that follows.</p>
<p>206.December 25, 1913.</p>
<p>207.In the 1925 seminar, Jung said: “A few evenings later, I felt that things should continue, so again I tried to follow the same procedure, but it would not descend. I remained on the surface. Then I realized that I had a conflict in myself about going down, but I could not make out what <em>it</em> was, I only felt that two dark principles were fighting each other, two serpents” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, p. 104). He then recounted the fantasy that ensued.</p>
<p>208.In the 1925 seminar, Jung added: “I thought, ‘Ha, this is a Druidic sacred place’ ” (Ibid.).</p>
<p>209.In Wagner’s <em>Ring of the Nibelung</em>, the Nibelung dwarf Mime is the brother of Alberich and a master craftsman. Alberich stole the Rhinegold from the Rhinemaidens; through renouncing love, he was able to forge a ring out of it that conferred limitless power. In <em>Siegfried</em>, Mime, who lives in a cave, brings up Siegfried so that he will kill Fafner the giant, who has transformed into a dragon and now has the ring. Siegfried slays Fafner with the invincible sword that Mime has fashioned, and kills Mime, who had intended to kill him after he had recovered the ring.</p>
<p>210.In the 1925 seminar, Jung interpreted this episode as follows: “the fight of the two snakes: the white means a movement into the day, the black into the kingdom of darkness, with moral aspects too. There was a real conflict in me, a resistance to going down. My stronger tendency was to go up. Because I had been so impressed the day before with the cruelty of the place I had seen, I really had a tendency to find a way to the conscious by going up, as I did on the mountain . . . Elijah said that it was just the same below or above. Compare Dante’s <em>Inferno</em>. The Gnostics express this same idea in the symbol of the reversed cones. Thus the mountain and the crater are similar. There was nothing of conscious structure in these fantasies, they were just events that happened. So I assume that Dante got his ideas from the same archetypes” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, pp. 104–5). McGuire suggests that Jung is referring to Dante’s conception “of the conical form of the cavity of Hell, with its circles, mirroring in reverse the form of Heaven, with its spheres” (Ibid.). In <em>Aion</em>, Jung also noted that serpents were a typical pair of opposites, and that the conflict between serpents was a motif found in medieval alchemy (1951, <em>CW</em> 9, 2, §181).</p>
<p>211.In the 1925 seminar, Jung recounted that after Salome’s declaration that he was Christ: “In spite of my objections she maintained this. I said, ‘this is madness,’ and became filled with skeptical resistance” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, p. 104). He interpreted this event as follows: “Salome’s approach and her worshiping of me is obviously that side of the inferior function which is surrounded by an aura of evil. One is assailed by the fear that perhaps this is madness. This is how madness begins, this is madness. . . You cannot get conscious of these unconscious facts without giving yourself to them. If you can overcome your fear of the unconscious and can let yourself go down, then these facts take on a life of their own. You can be gripped by these ideas so much that you really go mad, or nearly so. These images have so much reality that they recommend themselves, and such extraordinary meaning that one is caught. They form part of the ancient mysteries; in fact it is such fantasies that made the mysteries. Compare the mysteries of Isis as told in Apuleius, with the initiation and deification of the initiate. . . One gets a peculiar feeling from being put through such an initiation. The important part that led up to the deification was the snake’s encoiling of me. Salome’s performance was deification. The animal face which I felt mine transformed into was the famous [Deus] Leontocephalus of the Mithraic mysteries, the figure which is represented with a snake coiled around the man, the snake’s head resting on the man’s head, and the face of the man that of a lion. . . In this deification mystery you make yourself into the vessel, and are a vessel of creation in which the opposites reconcile.” He added: “All this is Mithraic symbolism from beginning to end” (Ibid., pp. 105–8). In <em>The Golden Ass</em>, Lucian undergoes an initiation into the mysteries of Isis. The significance of this episode is that it is the only direct description of such an initiation that has survived. Of the event itself, Lucian states: <em>“I approached the very gates of death and set foot on Prosperine’s threshold, yet was permitted to return, rapt through all the elements. At midnight I saw the sun shining as if it were noon; I entered the presence of the gods of the under-world and the gods of the upper-world, stood near and worshiped them.”</em> After this, he was presented on a pulpit in the temple in front of a crowd. He wore garments which included designs of serpents and winged lions, held a torch, and wore “a palm tree chaplet with its leaves sticking all out like rays of light” (<em>The Golden Ass</em>, tr. R. Graves [Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984], p. 241). Jung’s copy of a German translation of this work has a line in the margin by this passage.</p>
<p>212.In “On the psychology of the Kore figure” (1951), Jung described these episodes as follows: “In an underground house, actually in the underworld, there lives an old magician and prophet with his ‘daughter.’ She is, however, not really his daughter; she is a dancer, a very loose person, but is blind and seeks healing” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §360). This description of Elijah draws him together with the later description of Philemon. Jung noted that this “shows the unknown woman as a mythological figure in the beyond (that means in the unconscious). She is <em>soror</em> or <em>filia mystica</em> of a hierophant or ‘philosopher,’ evidently a parallel to those mystic syzigies which are to be met with in the figures of Simon Magus and Helen, Zosimus and Theosebia, Comarius and Cleopatra, etc. Our dream-figure fits in best with Helen” (Ibid., §372).</p>
<p>213.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “Guiding Reflection” (p. 127). In <em>Black Book 2</em>, Jung copied the following citations from Dante’s <em>Commedia</em> in German translation (p. 104): “And I to him: ‘I am one who, when love / Breathes on me, notices, and in the manner / That he dictates within, I utter words’ ” (Purgatorio 24, 52–54); “And then, in the same manner as a flame / Which follows the fire whatever shape it takes, / The new form follows the spirit exactly” (Purgatorio 25, 97–99). Tr. C. H. Sisson (Manchester: Carcanet, 1980), pp. 259, 265.</p>
<p>214.The <em>Draft</em> has: “the news of the desire revived by the mother” (p. 143).</p>
<p>215.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “of the primordial image” (p. 127).</p>
<p>216.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “The idea or the primordial image” (p. 127).</p>
<p>217.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “lives” (p. 127).</p>
<p>218.I.e., in ch. 5, “Descent into Hell in the Future.”</p>
<p>219.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “the spirit” (p. 127).</p>
<p>220.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Therefore they all say that they are fighting for the good and for peace, but one cannot fight one another over the good. But since men don’t know that the conflict lies within themselves, the Germans thus believe that the English and the Russians are wrong; but the English and the Russians say that the Germans are wrong. But no one can judge history in terms of right and wrong. Because one-half of mankind is wrong, every man is half wrong. Therefore a conflict resides in his own soul. But man is blind and always knows only his half. The German has in him the English and the Russian whom he fights outside of himself. Likewise, the English and the Russian has in him the German whom he fights. But man appears to see the outer quarrel, not the one within, which alone is the wellspring of the great war. But before man can ascend to light and love, the great battle is needed” (p. 145).</p>
<p>221.In December 1916, in his preface to <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processess,</em> Jung wrote: “The psychological processes, which accompany the present war, above all the incredible brutalization of public opinion, the mutual slanderings, the unprecedented fury of destruction, the monstrous flood of lies, and man’s incapacity to call a halt to the bloody demon—are suited like nothing else to powerfully push in front of the eyes of thinking men the problem of the restlessly slumbering chaotic unconscious under the ordered world of consciousness. This war has pitilessly revealed to civilized man that he is still a barbarian. . . <em>But the psychology of the individual corresponds to the psychology of the nation. What the nation does is done also by each individual, and so long as the individual does it, the nation also does it.</em> Only the change in the attitude of the individual is the beginning of the change in the psychology of the nation” (<em>CW</em> 7, p. 4).</p>
<p>222.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “the prophet, the personification of the idea” (p. 131).</p>
<p>223.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “Idea” (p. 131).</p>
<p>224.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has “Idea” substituted throughout this paragraph (p. 131).</p>
<p>225.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> adds “conscious” and deletes “From within himself” (p. 133).</p>
<p>226.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have instead: “The divine creative power becomes [in him] a person [a personal consciousness] from the [unconscious] collective” (pp. 133–34).</p>
<p>227.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have: “But why, you ask, does forethinking [the idea] appear to you in the guise of a Jewish prophet and your [the] pleasure in the guise of the heathen Salome? My friend, do not forget, that I too am one who thinks and wants in the spirit of this time, and is completely under the spell of the serpent. I am just now through my initiation into the mysteries of the spirit of the depths about to not entirely discard all the ancientness lacked by those thinking in the spirit of this time, but to readopt it into my being human, to make my life whole. For I have become poor and far removed from God. I must take in the divine and the mundane, since the spirit of this time had nothing else to give me; on the contrary he took the little that I possessed of real life. But in particular he made me hasty and greedy, since he is merely the present and he forced me to hunt down everything present to fill the moment” (pp. 134–35).</p>
<p>228.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have: “Just as the old prophets [ancients] stood before the Mysterium of Christ, I also stand as yet before the [this] Mysterium of Christ, [insofar as I reassume the past] although I live two thousand years after him [later] and at one time believed I was a Christian. But I had never been a Christ” (p. 136).</p>
<p>229.In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche wrote: “To redeem the past and to transform every ‘It was’ into an ‘I wanted it thus!’—that alone do I call redemption!” (“Of redemption,” p. 161).</p>
<p>230.On February 11, 1916, Jung said in a discussion at the Association for Analytical Psychology: “We abuse the will, natural growth is subjugated to the will. . . War teaches us: The will is of no use—we will see where this leads. We are completely subject to the absolute power of the becoming” (<em>MAP</em>, vol. 1, p. 106).</p>
<p>231.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have: “Since you are [we are] inwardly still ancient Jews and heathens with unholy Gods” (p. 137).</p>
<p>232.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “we ourselves” (p. 138).</p>
<p>233.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “and we called ourselves Christians, imitators of Christ. To be Christ onself is the true following of Christ” (p. 139).</p>
<p>234.This may refer to the German peasants’ rebellion of 1525.</p>
<p>235.In 1918, in his preface to the second edition of <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes</em>, Jung wrote: “The spectacle of this catastrophe threw man back on himself by making him feel his complete impotence; it turned him inward, and, with everything rocking, he seeks something that guarantees him a hold. Too many still seek outward. . . But still too few seek inward, to their own selves, and still fewer ask themselves whether the ends of human society might not best be served if each man tries to abolish the old order in himself, and to practice in his own person and in his own inward state those precepts, those victories which he preaches at every street-corner, instead of always expecting these things of his fellow men” (<em>CW</em> 7, p. 5).</p>
<p>236.The <em>Draft</em> has: “If this doesn’t happen, Christ will not be overcome and the evil must become even greater. Therefore, my friend, I say this to you so that you can tell your friends, and that the word may spread among the people” (p. 157).</p>
<p>237.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “I saw that a new God had come to be out of Christ the Lord, a young Hercules” (p. 157).</p>
<p>238.A long passage occurs here in the <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em>, a paraphrase of which follows: The God holds love in his right, forethinking [“the idea,” substituted throughout] in his left. Love is on our favorable side, forethinking on the unfavorable. This should recommend love to you, insofar as you are a part of this world, and especially if you are a thinker. The God possesses both. Their unity is God. The God develops through the uniting of both principles in you [me]. You [I] do not become God through this, or become divine, but God becomes human. He becomes apparent in you and through you, as a child. The divine will come to you as childlike or childish, insofar as you are a developed man. The childish man has an old God, the old God who we know and whose death we have seen. If you are grown up, you can only become more childlike. You have youth before you and all the mysteries of what is to come. The childish has death before him since he must first become grown up. You will become grown up insofar as you overcome the God of the ancients and of your childhood. You overcome him not through setting him aside, obeying the spirit of the time [: Zeitgeist]. The spirit of this time sways between yes and no like a drunkard [“since he is the uncertainty of the present general consciousness” ]. You [“One,” throughout] can only overcome the old God through becoming him yourself and experiencing his suffering and dying yourself. You overcome him and become yourself, as one who seeks himself and no longer imitates heroes. You free yourself, when you free yourself from the old God and his model. When you have become the model, then you no longer need his. In that the God held love and forethinking in the form of the serpent in his hands, it was shown to me that he had seized the human will. [“God unifies the opposition between love and the idea, and holds it in his hands.” ] Love and forethinking existed from eternity, but they were not willed. Everyone always wills the spirit of this time, which thinks and desires. He who wills the spirit of the depths, wills love and forethinking. If you will both, you become God. If you do this, the God is born and seizes possession of the will of men and holds his will in his child’s hand. The spirit of the depths appears in you as thoroughly childish. If you don’t want the spirit of the depths, he is to you a torment. Willing leads to the way. Love and forethinking are in the world of the beyond, so long as you do not will them and your willing lies between them like the serpent [“keeps them separate” ]. If you will both, the struggle breaks out in you between willing love and willing forethinking [“recognition” ]. You will see that you can’t will both at the same time. In this need the God will be born, as you have experienced in the Mysterium, and he will take the divided will in his hands, in the hands of a child, whose will is simple and beyond being split. What is this divine-childish willing? You can’t learn it through description, it can only become in you. Nor can you will it. You cannot learn or empathize it from what I say. It is unbelievable how men can falsify themselves and lie to themselves. Let this be a warning. What I say is my mystery and not yours, my way and not yours, since my self belongs to me and not to you. You should not learn my way but your own. My way leads to me and not to you (pp. 142–45).</p>
<p>239.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has “The great spirit” (p. 146).</p>
<p>240.A long passage appears here in the <em>Corrected Draft</em>, a paraphrase of which follows: As you saw how pride and power filled men and how beauty streamed out of the eyes of women when the war gripped the people, you knew that mankind was on the way. You knew that this war was not only adventure, criminal acts and killing, but the mystery of self-sacrifice. The [“great,” changed throughout] spirit of the depths has seized humanity and forced him through the war to self-sacrifice. Do not seek the guilt here or there. [“Guilt doesn’t lie outside” ]—It is the spirit of the depths who leads the people into the Mysterium, just as he led me. He leads the people to the river of blood, just as he led me. I experienced in the Mysterium what the people were forced to do in actuality [“which happened outside on a large scale” ]. I did not know it, but the Mysterium taught me how my willing laid itself at the feet of the crucified God. I experienced [wanted] Christ’s self-sacrifice. The Mysterium of Christ completed itself in front of my eyes. My forethinking [“The idea standing above me” ] forced me to this, but I resisted. My highest desire, my lions, my hottest and strongest passion, I wanted to rise up against the mysterious will to self-sacrifice. So I was like a lion encircled by the serpent, [“an image of fate eternally renewing itself” ]. Salome came to me from the right, the favorable side. Pleasure awakened in me. I experienced that my pleasure comes to me when I accomplish the self-sacrifice. I hear that Maria, the symbol of love, is also the [my] mother of Christ, since love has also borne Christ. Love brings the self-sacrificer and self-sacrifice. Love is also the mother of my self-sacrifice. In that I hear and accept this, I experience that I become Christ, since I recognize that love makes me into Christ. But I still doubt, since it is nearly impossible for the thinker to differentiate himself from his thought and accept that what happens in his thought is also something outside of himself. It is outside him in the inner world. I become Christ in the Mysterium, rather I see, how I was made into Christ and yet am completely myself, so that I could still doubt when my pleasure told me that I was Christ. [Salome,] My pleasure said to me, [“that I am Christ” ] because love, which is higher than pleasure, which however is still in me hidden in pleasure, had led me to self-sacrifice and made me into Christ. Pleasure came near to me, encircled me in rings and forced me to experience the torment of Christ and to spill my blood for the world. My willing, which earlier served the spirit of this time [“Zeitgeist,” substituted throughout] went under to the spirit of the depths, and just as it was previously determined by the spirit of the time, it is now determined by the spirit of the depths, by forethinking [“Idea,” substituted throughout] and pleasure. It determined me through the willing of self-sacrifice, and to the spilling of blood, my life’s essence. Mark that it is my bad pleasure which leads me to self-sacrifice. Its innermost is love, which will be freed from pleasure through sacrifice. Here the wonder happened that my previously blind pleasure became sighted. My pleasure was blind, and it was love. Since my strongest willing willed self-sacrifice, my pleasure changed, it went into a higher principle, which in God is one with forethinking. Love is sighted, but pleasure is blind. Pleasure always wants what is closest, and feels through the multiplicity, going from one to another, without a goal, just seeking and never fulfilled. Love wants what is furthest, the best and the fulfilling. And I saw something further, namely that the forethinking in me had the form of an old prophet, which showed that it was pre-Christian, and transformed itself into a principle that no longer appeared in a human form, but in the absolute form of a pure white light. So the human relative transformed itself into the divine absolute through the Mysterium of Christ. Forethinking and pleasure united in me in a new form and the willing in me, which appeared foreign and dangerous, the willing of the spirit of the depths, lay paralyzed at the feet of the shining flame. I became one with my will. This happened in me, I just saw it in the mystery play. Through this much was made known that I didn’t previously know [“like in a play” ]. But I found everything doubtful. I felt as if he was melting in the air, since the land of the Mysterium [that spirit] was still foreign to me. The Mysterium showed me the things which lay before me and had to be fulfilled. But I did not know how and when. But that image of the sighted Salome, who knelt in rapture before the white flame, was a strong feeling that came to the side of my will and led me through everything that came after. What happened was my wandering with myself, through whose suffering I had to earn what served for the completion of the Mysterium I had seen [“I had first seen” ] (pp. 146–50).</p>
<p>241.Gilles Quispel reports that Jung told the Dutch poet Roland Horst that he had written <em>Psychological Types</em> on the basis of thirty pages of <em>The Red Book</em> (cited in Stephan Hoeller, <em>The Gnostic Jung and the Seven Sermons to the Dead</em> [Wheaton, IL: Quest, 1985], p. 6). It is likely that he had in mind these preceding three chapters of the “Mysterium.” What is presented here develops the notions of the conflict between opposing functions, the identification with the leading function, and the development of the reconciling symbol as a resolution of the conflict of opposites, which are the central issues in chapter 5 of <em>Psychological Types</em> (<em>CW</em> 6), the “Type Problem in Poetry.” In his 1925 seminar, Jung said: “I found that the unconscious is working out enormous collective fantasies. Just as, before, I was passionately interested in working out myths, now I became just as much interested in the material of the unconscious. This is in fact the only way of getting at myth formation. And so the first chapter of the <em>Psychology of the Unconscious</em> became most correctly true. I watched the creation of myths going on, and got an insight into the structure of the unconscious, forming thus the concept that plays such a role in the <em>Types</em>. I drew all my empirical material from my patients, but the solution of the problem I drew from the inside, from my observations of the unconscious processes. I have tried to fuse these two currents of outer and inner experience in the book of the <em>Types</em>, and have termed the process of the fusion of the two currents the transcendent function” (<em>Introduction to Jungian Psychology</em>, p. 35).</p>

<p>The Red One4</p>
<p>Cap. i.</p>
<p>[HI 2]5 [2] The door of the Mysterium has closed behind me. I feel that my will is paralyzed and that the spirit of the depths possesses me. I know nothing about a way. I can therefore neither want this nor that, since nothing indicates to me whether I want this or that. I wait, without knowing what I’m waiting for. But already in the following night I felt that I had reached a solid point.6</p>
<p>[1] 7I find that I am standing on the highest tower of a castle. The air tells me so: I am far back in time. My gaze wanders widely over solitary countryside, a combination of fields and forests. I am wearing a green garment. A horn hangs from my shoulder. I am the tower guard. I look out into the distance. I see a red point out there. It comes nearer on a winding road, disappearing for a while in forests and reappearing again: it is a horseman in a red coat, the red horseman. He is coming to my castle: he is already riding through the gate. I hear steps on the stairway, the steps creak, he knocks: a strange fear comes over me: there stands the Red One, his long shape wholly shrouded in red, even his hair is red. I think: in the end he will turn out to be the devil.</p>
<p>The Red One: “I greet you, man on the high tower. I saw you from afar, looking and waiting. Your waiting has called me.”</p>
<p>I: “Who are you?”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Who am I? You think I am the devil. Do not pass judgment. Perhaps you can also talk to me without knowing who I am. What sort of a superstitious fellow are you, that immediately you think of the devil?”</p>
<p>I: “If you have no supernatural ability, how could you feel that I stood waiting on my tower, looking out for the unknown and the new? My life in the castle is poor, since I always sit here and no one climbs up to me.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “So what are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>I: “I await all kinds of things, and especially I’m waiting for some of the world’s wealth, which we don’t see here, to come to me.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “So, I have come to absolutely the right place. I have wandered a long time through the world, seeking those like you who sit upon a high tower on the lookout for things unseen.”</p>
<p>I: “You make me curious. You seem to be a rare breed. Your appearance is not ordinary, and then too—forgive me—it seems to me that you bring with you a strange air, something worldly, something impudent, or exuberant, or—in fact—something pagan.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “You don’t offend me, on the contrary, you hit your nail on the head. But I’m no old pagan as you seem to think.”</p>
<p>I: “I don’t want to insist on that. You are also not pompous and Latin enough. You have nothing classical about you. You seem to be a son of our time, but as I must remark, a rather unusual one. You’re no real pagan, but the kind of pagan who runs alongside our Christian religion.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “You’re truly a good diviner of riddles. You’re doing better than many others who have totally mistaken me.”</p>
<p>I: “You sound cool and sneering. Have you never broken your heart over the holiest mysteries of our Christian religion?”</p>
<p>T. R.: “You’re an unbelievably ponderous and serious person. Are you always so urgent?”</p>
<p>I: “I would before God always like to be as serious and true to myself as I try to be. However, that certainly becomes difficult in your presence. You bring a certain gallows air with you, and you’re bound to be from the black school of Salerno,8 where pernicious arts are taught by pagans and the descendants of pagans.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “You’re superstitious and too German. You take literally what the scriptures say, otherwise you could not judge me so hard.”</p>
<p>2/3 I: “A hard judgment is the last thing I would want. But my nose does not play tricks on me. You’re evasive, and don’t want to reveal yourself. What are you hiding?”</p>
<p>(The Red One seems to get redder, his garments shine like glowing iron.)</p>
<p>T. R.: “I hide nothing from you, you true-hearted soul. I simply amuse myself with your weighty seriousness and your comic veracity. This is so rare in our time, especially in men who have understanding at their disposal.”</p>
<p>I: “I believe you cannot fully understand me. You apparently compare me with those whom you know. But I must say to you for the sake of truth that I neither really belong to this time nor to this place. A spell has banished me to this place and time for years. I am really not what you see before you.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “You say astounding things. Who are you then?”</p>
<p>I: “That is irrelevant. I stand before you as that which I presently am. Why am I here and like this, I do not know. But I do know that I must be here to justify myself according to my best knowledge. I know just as little who you are, as you know who I am.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “That sounds very strange. Are you something of a saint? Hardly a philosopher, since you have no aptitude for scholarly language. But a saint? Surely that. Your solemnity smells of fanaticism. You have an ethical air and a simplicity that smacks of stale bread and water.”</p>
<p>I: “I can say neither yes nor no: you speak as one trapped in the spirit of this time. It seems to me that you lack the terms of comparison.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Perhaps you attended the school of the pagans? You answer like a sophist.9 How can you then measure me with the yardstick of the Christian religion, if you are no saint?”</p>
<p>I: “It seems to me, though, that one can apply this yardstick even if one is no saint. I believe I have learned that no one is allowed to avoid the mysteries of the Christian religion unpunished. I repeat: he whose heart has not been broken over the Lord Jesus Christ drags a pagan around in himself, who holds him back from the best.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Again this old tune? What for, if you are not a Christian saint? Are you not a damned sophist after all?”</p>
<p>I: “You are ensnared in your own world. But you certainly seem to think that one can assess the worth of Christianity correctly without being a downright saint.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Are you a doctor of theology, who examines Christianity from the outside and appreciates it historically, and therefore a sophist after all?”</p>
<p>I: “You’re stubborn. What I mean is that it’s hardly a coincidence that the whole world has become Christian. I also believe that it was the task of Western man to carry Christ in his heart and to grow with his suffering, death, and resurrection.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Well, there are also Jews who are good people and yet had no need for your solemn gospels.”</p>
<p>I: “You are, it seems to me, no good reader of people: have you never noticed that the Jew himself lacks something—one in his head, another in his heart, and he himself feels that he lacks something?”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Indeed I’m no Jew, but I must come to the Jew’s defense: you seem to be a Jew hater.”</p>
<p>I: “Well, now you speak like all those Jews who accuse anyone of Jew hating who does not have a completely favorable judgment, while they themselves make the bloodiest jokes about their own kind. Since the Jews only too clearly feel that particular lack and yet do not want to admit it, they are extremely sensitive to criticism. Do you believe that Christianity left no mark on the souls of men? And do you believe that one who has not experienced this most intimately can still partake of its fruit?”10</p>
<p>T. R.: “You argue your case well. But your solemnity?! You could make matters much easier for yourself. If you’re no saint, I really don’t see why you have to be so solemn. You wholly spoil the fun. What the devil is troubling you? Only Christianity with its mournful escape from the world can make people 3/4 so ponderous and sullen.”</p>
<p>I: “I think there are still other things that bespeak seriousness.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Oh, I know, you mean life. I know this phrase. I too live and don’t let my hair turn white over it. Life doesn’t require any seriousness. On the contrary, it’s better to dance through life.”11</p>
<p>I: “I know how to dance. Yes, would we could do it by dancing! Dancing goes with the mating season. I know that there are those who are always in heat, and those who also want to dance for their Gods. Some are ridiculous and others enact Antiquity, instead of honestly admitting their utter incapacity for such expression.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Here, my dear fellow, I doff my mask. Now I grow somewhat more serious, since this concerns my own province. It’s conceivable that there is some third thing for which dancing would be the symbol.”</p>
<p>The red of the rider transforms itself into a tender reddish flesh color. And behold—Oh miracle—my green garments everywhere burst into leaf.</p>
<p>I: “Perhaps too there is a joy before God that one can call dancing. But I haven’t yet found this joy. I look out for things that are yet to come. Things came, but joy was not among them.”</p>
<p>T. R.: “Don’t you recognize me, brother, I am joy!”</p>
<p>I: “Could you be joy? I see you as through a cloud. Your image fades. Let me take your hand, beloved, who are you, who are you?”</p>
<p>Joy? Was he joy?</p>
<p>[2] Surely this red one was the devil, but my devil. That is, he was my joy, the joy of the serious person, who keeps watch alone on the high tower—his red-colored, red-scented, warm bright red joy.12 Not the secret joy in his thoughts and in his looking, but that strange joy of the world that comes unsuspected like a warm southerly wind with swelling fragrant blossoms and the ease of living. You know it from your poets, this seriousness, when they expectantly look toward what happens in the depths, sought out first of all by the devil because of their springlike joy.13 It picks up men like a wave and drives them forth. Whoever tastes this joy forgets himself.14 And there is nothing sweeter than forgetting oneself. And not a few have forgotten what they are. But even more have taken root so firmly that not even the rosy wave is able to uproot them. They are petrified and too heavy, while the others are too light.</p>
<p>I earnestly confronted my devil and behaved with him as with a real person. This I learned in the Mysterium: to take seriously every unknown wanderer who personally inhabits the inner world, since they are real because they are effectual.15 It does not help that we say in the spirit of this time: there is no devil. There was one with me. This took place in me. I did with him what I could. I could speak with him. A religious conversation is inevitable with the devil, since he demands it, if one does not want to surrender to him unconditionally. Because religion is precisely what the devil and I cannot agree about. I must have it out with him, as I cannot expect that he as an independent personality would accept my standpoint without further ado.</p>
<p>I would be fleeing if I did not try to come to an understanding with him. If ever you have the rare opportunity to speak with the devil, then do not forget to confront him in all seriousness. He is your devil after all. The devil as the adversary is your own other standpoint; he tempts you and sets a stone in your path where you least want it.</p>
<p>Taking the devil seriously does not mean going over to his side, or else one becomes the devil. Rather it means coming to an understanding. Thereby you accept your other standpoint. With that the devil fundamentally loses ground, and so do you. And that may be well and good.</p>
<p>Although the devil very much abhors religion for its particular solemnity and candor, it has become apparent, however, that it is precisely through religion that the devil can be brought to an understanding. What I said about dancing struck him because I spoke about something that belonged in his own domain. He fails to take seriously only what concerns others because that is the peculiarity of all devils. In such a manner, I arrive at his seriousness, and with this we reach common 4/5 ground where understanding is possible. The devil is convinced that dancing is neither lust nor madness, but an expression of joy, which is something proper to neither one nor the other. In this I agree with the devil. Therefore he humanizes himself before my eyes. But I turn green like a tree in spring.</p>
<p>Yet that joy is the devil, or that the devil is joy, has got to worry you. I pondered this for over a week, and I fear that it has not been enough. You dispute the fact that your joy is your devil. But it seems as if there is always something devilish about joy. If your joy is no devil for you, then possibly it is for your neighbors, since joy is the most supreme flowering and greening of life. This knocks you down, and you must grope for a new path, since the light in that joyful fire has completely gone out for you. Or your joy tears your neighbor away and throws him off course, since life is like a great fire that torches everything in its vicinity. But fire is the element of the devil.</p>
<p>When I saw that the devil is joy, surely I would have wanted to make a pact with him. But you can make no pact with joy, because it immediately disappears. Therefore you cannot capture the devil either. Yes, it belongs to his essence that he cannot be captured. He is stupid if he lets himself be caught, and you gain nothing from having yet one more stupid devil. The devil always seeks to saw off the branch on which you sit. That is useful and protects you from falling asleep and from the vices that go along with it.</p>
<p>The devil is an evil element. But joy? If you run after it, you see that joy also has evil in it, since then you arrive at pleasure and from pleasure go straight to Hell, your own particular Hell, which turns out differently for everyone.16</p>
<p>Through my coming to terms with the devil, he accepted some of my seriousness, and I accepted some of his joy. This gave me courage. But if the devil has gotten more earnest, one must brace oneself.17 It is always a risky thing to accept joy, but it leads us to life and its disappointment, from which the wholeness of our life becomes.18</p>
<p>The Castle in the Forest19</p>
<p>Cap. ii.</p>
<p>[HI 5] 20In the second night thereafter, I am walking alone in a dark forest and I notice that I have lost my way.21 I am on a dark cart track and stumble through the darkness. I finally come to quiet, dark swamp water, and a small old castle stands at its center. I think it would be good to ask here for the night’s lodgings. I knock on the door, I wait a long time, it begins to rain. I have to knock again. Now I hear someone coming: the door opens. A man in an old fashioned garment, a servant, asks what I want. I ask about lodgings for the night, and he lets me enter a dark vestibule. Then he leads me up an old, worn-out stairway. At the top I come to a wider and higher hall-like space with white walls, lined with black chests and wardrobes.</p>
<p>I am led into a kind of reception room. It is a simple space with old upholstered furniture. The dim light of an antiquated lamp lights the room only very meagerly. The servant knocks on a side door and then quietly opens it. I scan it swiftly: it’s a scholar’s study, with bookshelves on all four walls and a large writing desk, at which an old man sits wearing a long black robe. He beckons me to draw closer. The air in the room is heavy and the old man seems careworn. He is not without dignity—he seems to be one of those who have as much dignity as one can be granted. He has that modest-fearful look of scholarly men who have long since been squashed to nothing by the abundance of knowledge. I think that he is a real 5/6 scholar who has learned great modesty before the immensity of knowledge and has given himself tirelessly to the material of science and research, anxiously and equably appraising, as if he personally had to represent the working out of scientific truth.</p>
<p>He greets me embarrassed, as if absent and defensive. I do not wonder about this since I look like an ordinary person. Only with difficulty can he turn his gaze away from his work. I repeat my request for lodgings for the night. After a longer pause the old man remarks, “So, you want to sleep, then please yourself.” I notice that he is absentminded, and therefore ask him to instruct the servant to show me a chamber. To this he says, “You are demanding, wait, I cannot just drop everything!” He sinks again into his book. I wait patiently. After a while he looks up astonished: “What do you want here? Oh—forgive me—I totally forgot that you are waiting here. I’ll call the servant straightaway.” The servant comes and leads me to a small chamber on the same floor with bare white walls and a large bed. He wishes me good night and withdraws.</p>
<p>As I am tired, I undress immediately and go to bed, after I have snuffed out the candle. The sheet is uncommonly rough and the pillow hard. My errant way has led me to a strange place: a small old castle whose scholarly owner is apparently spending the evening of his life alone with his books. No one else seems to be living in the house apart from the servant who lives over there in the tower. An ideal though solitary existence, I think, this life of the old man with his books. And here my thoughts linger for a long time, until I finally notice that another thought doesn’t let go of me, namely that the old man has hidden his beautiful daughter here—a vulgar idea for a novel—an insipid, worn-out theme—but the romantic can be felt in every limb—a real novelistic idea—a castle in a forest—solitary night—an old man petrified in his books, protecting a costly treasure and enviously hiding it from all the world—what ridiculous thoughts come to me! Is it Hell or purgatory that I must also contrive such childish dreams on my wanderings? But I feel impotent to elevate my thoughts to something a bit stronger or more beautiful. I suppose I must allow these thoughts to come. What good would it do to push them away—they will come again—better to swallow this stale drink than keep it in the mouth. So what does this boring heroine look like? Surely blonde, pale—blue eyes—hoping longingly that every lost wanderer is her savior from the paternal prison—Oh, I know this hackneyed nonsense—I’d rather sleep—why the devil must I plague myself with such empty fantasies?</p>
<p>Sleep does not come. I toss and turn—sleep still does not come—must I finally harbor this unsaved soul in myself? And is it this that will not let me sleep? Have I such a novelistic soul? That’s all I needed—this would be agonizingly ridiculous. Does this bitterest of all drinks never end? It must already be midnight—and still sleep does not come. What in the wide world, then, won’t let me sleep? Is it something to do with this chamber? Is the bed bewitched? It’s terrible, what sleeplessness can drive a man to—even the most absurd and superstitious theories. It seems to be cool, I’m freezing—perhaps that’s what keeps me from sleeping—it’s really uncanny here—Heaven knows what goes on here—weren’t those steps just now? No, that must have been outside—I roll over, firmly closing my eyes, I simply must sleep. Wasn’t that the door just now? My God, someone is standing there! Am I seeing straight?—a slim girl, pale as death, standing at the door? For Heaven’s sake, what is this? She’s coming nearer!</p>
<p>“Have you come at last?” she asks quietly. Impossible—this is a cruel mistake—the novel wants to become real—does it want to grow into some silly ghost story? To what nonsense am I damned? Is it my soul that harbors such novelistic brilliance? Must this, too, happen to me? I am truly in Hell—the worst awakening after death, to be resurrected in a lending library! Have I held the men of my time and their taste in such contempt that I must live in Hell and write out the novels that I have already spat on long ago? Does the lower half of average human taste also claim holiness and invulnerability, so that we might not say any bad word 6/7 about it without having to atone for the sin in Hell?</p>
<p>She says, “Oh, so you too think me common? Do you too let yourself be deluded by the wretched delusion that I belong in a novel? You as well, whom I hoped had thrown off appearances and striven after the essence of things?”</p>
<p>I: “Forgive me, but are you real? It’s the sorriest likeness to those foolishly threadbare scenes in novels for me to assume that you are not simply some unfortunate product of my sleepless brain. Is my doubt then truly confirmed by a situation that conforms so thoroughly with a sentimental romance?”</p>
<p>She: “You wretch, how can you doubt that I am real?”</p>
<p>She falls to her knees at the foot of my bed, sobbing and holding her face in her hands. My God, in the end is she really real, and do I do her an injustice? My pity awakens.</p>
<p>I: “But for Heaven’s sake, tell me one thing: in all earnestness must I assume that you are real?”</p>
<p>She weeps and does not answer.</p>
<p>I: “Who are you, then?”</p>
<p>She: “I am the old man’s daughter. He holds me here in unbearable captivity, not out of envy or hate, but out of love, since I am his only child and the image of my mother. who died young.”</p>
<p>I scratch my head: is this not some hellish banality? Word for word, pulp fiction from the lending library! Oh you Gods, where have you led me? It’s enough to make one laugh, it’s enough to make one weep—to be a beautiful sufferer, a tragic shattered person is difficult, but to become an ape, you beautiful and great ones? To you the banal and eternally ridiculous, the unutterably hackneyed and emptied out, is never set like a gift of Heaven in uplifted praying hands.</p>
<p>But still she lies there, crying—yet what if she were real? Then she would be worth feeling sorry for, every man would have compassion for her. If she is a decent girl, what must it have cost her to enter into the room of a strange man! And to overcome her shame in this way?</p>
<p>I: “My dear child, I believe you, despite everything, that you are real. What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>She: “Finally, finally a word from a human mouth!”</p>
<p>She gets up, her face beaming. She is beautiful. A deep purity rests in her look. She has a beautiful and unworldly soul, one that wants to come into the life of reality, to all reality worthy of pity, to the bath of filth and the well of health. Oh this beauty of the soul! To see it climb down into the underworld of reality—what a spectacle!</p>
<p>She: “What can you do for me? You have already done much for me. You spoke the redeeming word when you no longer placed the banal between you and me. Know then: I was bewitched by the banal.”</p>
<p>I: “Woe is me, you now become very fairy-tale-like.”</p>
<p>She: “Be reasonable, dear friend, and do not stumble now over the fabulous, since the fairy tale is the great mother of the novel, and has even more universal validity than the most-avidly read novel of your time. And you know that what has been on everyone’s lips for millennia, though repeated endlessly, still comes nearest the ultimate human truth. So do not let the fabulous come between us.”22</p>
<p>I: “You are clever and do not seem to have inherited the wisdom of your father. But tell me, what do you think of the divinity, of the so-called ultimate truths? I found it very strange to seek them in banality. According to their nature, they must be quite uncommon. Think only of our great philosophers.”</p>
<p>She: “The more uncommon these highest truths are, the more inhuman must they be and the less they speak to you as something valuable or meaningful concerning human essence and being. Only what is human and what you call banal and hackneyed 7/8 contains the wisdom that you seek. The fabulous does not speak against me but for me, and proves how universally human I am and how much I too not only need redemption but also deserve it. For I can live in the world of reality as well or better than many others of my sex.”</p>
<p>I: “Strange maiden, you are bewildering—when I saw your father, I hoped he would invite me to a scholarly conversation. He did not, and I was aggrieved at him because of this, since his distracted slackness hurt my dignity. But with you I find it much better. You give me matters to ponder. You are uncommon.”</p>
<p>She: “You are mistaken, I am very common.”</p>
<p>I: “I can’t believe that. How beautiful and worthy of adoration is the expression of your soul in your eyes. Happy and enviable is the man who will free you.”</p>
<p>She: “Do you love me?”</p>
<p>I: “By God, I love you—but—unfortunately I am already married.”</p>
<p>She: “So—you see: even banal reality is a redeemer. I thank you, dear friend, and I bring you greetings from Salome.”</p>
<p>With these words her shape dissolves into darkness. Dim moonlight penetrates the room. Where she stood something shadowy lies—it is a profusion of red roses.23</p>
<p>[2] 24If no outer adventure happens to you, then no inner adventure happens to you either. The part that you take over from the devil—joy, that is—leads you into adventure. In this way you will find your lower as well as your upper limits. It is necessary for you to know your limits. If you do not know them, you run into the artificial barriers of your imagination and the expectations of your fellow men. But your life will not take kindly to being hemmed in by artificial barriers. Life wants to jump over such barriers and you will fall out with yourself. These barriers are not your real limits, but arbitrary limitations that do unnecessary violence to you. Therefore try to find your real limits. One never knows them in advance, but one sees and understands them only when one reaches them. And this happens to you only if you have balance. Without balance you transgress your limits without noticing what has happened to you. You achieve balance, however, only if you nurture your opposite. But that is hateful to you in your innermost core, because it is not heroic.</p>
<p>My spirit reflected on everything rare and uncommon, it pried its way into unfound possibilities, toward paths that lead into the hidden, toward lights that shine in the night. And as my spirit did this, everything ordinary in me suffered harm without my noticing it, and it began to hanker after life, since I did not live it. Hence this adventure. I was smitten by the romantic. The romantic is a step backward. To reach the way, one must sometimes also take a few steps backward.25</p>
<p>In the adventure I experienced what I had witnessed in the Mysterium. What I saw there as Salome and Elijah became in life the old scholar and his pale, locked-up daughter. What I live is a distorted likeness of the Mysterium. Following the romantic way I reached the awkwardness and ordinariness of life, where I run out of thoughts and almost forget myself. What I formerly loved I must now experience as feeble and wasted, and what I formerly derided I had to envy as towering and helplessly crave. I accepted the absurdity of this adventure. No sooner had this happened than I also saw how the maiden transformed herself and signified an autonomous meaning. One inquires into the desire of the ridiculous, and that is enough for it to change.</p>
<p>What about masculinity? Do you know how much femininity man lacks for completeness? Do you know how much masculinity woman lacks for completeness? You seek the feminine in women and the masculine in men. And thus there are always only men and women. But where are people? You, man, should not seek the feminine in women, but seek and recognize it in yourself, as you 8/9 possess it from the beginning. It pleases you, however, to play at manliness, because it travels on a well-worn track. You, woman, should not seek the masculine in men, but assume the masculine in yourself, since you possess it from the beginning. But it amuses you and is easy to play at femininity, consequently man despises you because he despises his femininity. But humankind is masculine and feminine, not just man or woman. You can hardly say of your soul what sex it is. But if you pay close attention, you will see that the most masculine man has a feminine soul, and the most feminine woman has a masculine soul. The more manly you are, the more remote from you is what woman really is, since the feminine in yourself is alien and contemptuous.26</p>
<p>If you take a piece of joy from the devil and set off on adventures with it, you accept your pleasure. But pleasure immediately attracts everything you desire, and then you must decide whether your pleasure spoils or enhances you. If you are of the devil, you will grope in blind desire after the manifold, and it will lead you astray. But if you remain with yourself, as a man who is himself and not of the devil, then you will remember your humanity. You will not behave toward women per se as a man, but as a human being, that is to say, as if you were of the same sex as her. You will recall your femininity. It may seem to you then as if you were unmanly, stupid, and feminine so to speak. But you must accept the ridiculous, otherwise you will suffer distress, and there will come a time, when you are least observant, when it will suddenly round on you and make you ridiculous. It is bitter for the most masculine man to accept his femininity, since it appears ridiculous to him, powerless and tawdry.</p>
<p>Yes, it seems as if you have lost all virtue, as if you have fallen into debasement. It seems the same way to the woman who accepts her masculinity.27 Yes, it seems to you like enslavement. You are a slave of what you need in your soul. The most masculine man needs women, and he is consequently their slave. Become a woman yourself,28 and you will be saved from slavery to woman. You are abandoned without mercy to woman so long as you cannot fend off mockery with all your masculinity. It is good for you once to put on women’s clothes: people will laugh at you, but through becoming a woman you attain freedom from women and their tyranny. The acceptance of femininity leads to completion. The same is valid for the woman who accepts her masculinity.</p>
<p>The feminine in men is bound up with evil. I find it on the way of desire. The masculine in the woman is bound up with evil. Therefore people hate to accept their own other. But if you accept it, that which is connected with the perfection of men comes to pass: namely, that when you become the one who is mocked, the white bird of the soul comes flying. It was far away, but your humiliation attracted it.29 The mystery draws near to you, and things happen around you like miracles. A gold luster shines, since the sun has risen from its grave. As a man you have no soul, since it is in the woman; as a woman you have no soul, since it is in the man. But if you become a human being, then your soul comes to you.</p>
<p>If you remain within arbitrary and artificially created boundaries, you will walk as between two high walls: you do not see the immensity of the world. But if you break down the walls that confine your view, and if the immensity and its endless uncertainty inspire you with fear, then the ancient sleeper awakens in you, whose messenger is the white bird. Then you need the message of the old tamer of chaos. There in the whirl of chaos dwells eternal wonder. Your world begins to become wonderful. Man belongs not only to an ordered world, he also belongs in the wonder-world of his soul. Consequently you must make your ordered world horrible, so that you are put off by being too much outside yourself.</p>
<p>Your soul is in great need, because drought weighs on its world. If you look outside yourselves, you see the far-off forest and mountains, and above them your vision climbs to the realms of the stars. And if you look into yourselves, you will see on the other hand the nearby as far-off and infinite, since the world of the inner is as infinite as the world of the outer. Just as you become a part of the manifold essence of the world through your bodies, so you become a part of the manifold essence of the inner world through your soul. This inner world is truly infinite, in no way poorer than the outer one. Man lives in two worlds. A fool lives here or there, but never here and there.</p>
<p>30Perhaps you think that a man who consecrates his life to research leads a spiritual life and that his soul lives in 9/10 larger measure than anyone else’s. But such a life is also external, just as external as the life of a man who lives for outer things. To be sure, such a scholar does not live for outer things but for outer thoughts—not for himself, but for his object. If you say of a man that he has totally lost himself to the outer and wasted his years in excess, you must also say the same of this old man. He has thrown himself away in all the books and thoughts of others. Consequently his soul is in great need, it must humiliate itself and run into every stranger’s room to beg for the recognition that he fails to give her.</p>
<p>Therefore you see those old scholars running after recognition in a ridiculous and undignified manner. They are offended if their name is not mentioned, cast down if another one says the same thing in a better way, irreconcilable if someone alters theirs views in the least. Go to the meetings of scholars and you will see them, these lamentable old men with their great merits and their starved souls famished for recognition and their thirst which can never be slaked. The soul demands your folly, not your wisdom.</p>
<p>Therefore, because I rise above gendered masculinity and yet do not exceed the human, the feminine that is contemptible to me transforms itself into a meaningful being. This is the most difficult thing—to be beyond the gendered and yet remain within the human. If you rise above the gendered with the help of a general rule, you become the same as that rule and overreach the human. Therefore you become dry, hard, and inhuman.</p>
<p>You may go past the gendered for human reasons, and never for the sake of a general rule that remains the same in the most diverse situations, and therefore never has a perfect validity for each single situation. If you act from your humanity, you act from that particular situation without general principle, with only what corresponds to the situation. Thus you do justice to the situation, perhaps at the expense of a general rule. That should not be too painful for you, because you are not the rule. There is something else that is human, something all too human, and whoever has ended up there will do well to remember the blessing of the general rule.31 For the general rule also has meaning and has not been set up for fun. It comprises much venerable work of the human spirit. Such persons are not capable of a general principle above the gendered, but only their imagination is capable of what they have lost. They have become their own imagination and arbitrariness, to their own detriment. They need to remember the gendered, so that they wake from their dreams to reality.</p>
<p>It is as agonizing as a sleepless night to fulfill the beyond from the here and now, namely the other and the opposing in myself. It sneaks up like a fever, like a poisonous fog. And when your senses are excited and stretched to the utmost, the daimonic comes as something so insipid and worn out, so mild and stale, that it makes you sick. Here you would gladly stop feeling across to your beyond. Startled and disgusted, you long for the return of the supernal beauties of your visible world. You spit out and curse everything that lies beyond your lovely world, since you know that it is the disgust, scum, refuse of the human animal who stuffs himself in dark places, creeps along sidewalks, sniffs out every blessèd angle, and from the cradle to the grave enjoys only what has already been on everyone’s lips.</p>
<p>But here you may not stop—do not place your disgust between your here-and-now and your beyond. The way to your beyond leads through Hell and in fact through your own wholly particular Hell, whose bottom consists of knee-deep rubble, whose air is the spent breath of millions, whose fires are dwarflike passions, and whose devils are chimerical sign-boards.</p>
<p>Everything odious and disgusting is your own particular Hell. How can it be otherwise? Every other Hell was at least worth seeing or full of fun. But that is never Hell. Your Hell is made up of all the things that you always ejected from your sanctuary with a curse and a kick of the foot. When you step into your own Hell, never think that you come like one suffering in beauty, or as a proud pariah, but you come like a stupid and curious fool and gaze in wonder at the scraps that have fallen from your table.32 10/11</p>
<p>You really want to rage, but you see at the same time how well rage suits you. Your hellish absurdity stretches for miles. Good for you if you can swear! You will find that profanity is lifesaving. Thus if you go through Hell, you should not forget to give due attention to whatever crosses your path. Quietly look into everything that excites your contempt or rage; thereby you accomplish the miracle that I experienced with the pale maiden. You give soul to the soulless, and thereby it can come to something out of horrible nothingness. Thus you will redeem your other into life. Your values want to draw you away from what you presently are, to get you ahead of and beyond yourself. Your being, however, pulls you to the bottom like lead. You cannot at the same time live both, since both exclude each other. But on the way you can live both. Therefore the way redeems you. You cannot at the same time be on the mountain and in the valley, but your way leads you from mountain to valley and from valley to mountain. Much begins amusingly and leads into the dark. Hell has levels.33</p>
<p>One of the Lowly34</p>
<p>Cap. iii.</p>
<p>[HI 11] In the following night,35 I found myself wandering once more, in a homely, snow-covered country. A gray evening sky covers the sun. The air is moist and frosty. Someone who does not look trustworthy has joined me. Most notably, he has only one eye and a few scars on his face. He is poor and dirtily clothed, a tramp. He has a black stubble beard that has not seen a razor for a long time. I have a good walking stick for any eventuality. “It’s damned cold,” he remarks after a while. I agree. After a longer pause he asks: “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>I: “I’m going to the next village, where I plan to stay overnight.”</p>
<p>He: “I’d like to do that too, but will hardly manage to get a bed.”</p>
<p>I: “Have you no money? Well, let us see. Are you out of work?”</p>
<p>He: “Yes, times are bad. Until a few days ago, I was working for a locksmith. But then he had no more work. Now I’m traveling and looking for work.”</p>
<p>I: “Wouldn’t you work for a farmer? There is always a shortage of farm labor.”</p>
<p>He: “Working for a farmer doesn’t suit me. That means getting up early in the morning—the work is hard and wages are low.”</p>
<p>I: “But it’s always much more beautiful in the country than in a town.”</p>
<p>He: “It’s boring in the country, one meets nobody.”</p>
<p>I: “Well, but there are also villagers.”</p>
<p>He: “But there is no mental stimulation, the farmers are clods.”</p>
<p>I look at him astonished. What, he still wants mental stimulation? Better that he honestly earn his keep, and when he has done that he can think of stimulation. 11/12</p>
<p>I: “But tell me, what kind of mental stimulation is there in the city?”</p>
<p>He: “You can go to the cinema in the evenings. That’s great and it’s cheap. You get to see everything that happens in the world.”</p>
<p>I have to think of Hell, where there are also cinemas for those who despised this institution on earth and did not go there because everyone else found it to their taste.</p>
<p>I: “What interested you most about the cinema?”</p>
<p>He: “One sees all sorts of stunning feats. There was one man who ran up houses. Another carried his head under his arm. Another even stood in the middle of a fire and wasn’t burnt. Yes, it’s really remarkable, the things that people can do.”</p>
<p>And that’s what this fellow calls mental stimulation! But wait—that does seem remarkable: didn’t the saints also carry their heads under their arms?36 Didn’t Saint Francis and Saint Ignatius levitate—and what about the three men in the fiery furnace?37 Isn’t it a blasphemous idea to consider the <em>Acta Sanctorum</em> as historical cinema?38 Oh, today’s miracles are simply somewhat less mythical than technical. I regard my companion with feeling—he lives the history of the world—and I?</p>
<p>I: “Certainly, it’s very well done. Did you see anything else like this?”</p>
<p>He: “Yes, I saw how the King of Spain was murdered.”</p>
<p>I: “But he wasn’t murdered at all.”</p>
<p>He: “Well, that doesn’t matter; in that case it was one of those damned capitalist kings. At least they got one of them. If all of them were taken out, the people would be free.”</p>
<p>Not a word more dare I say: <em>Wilhelm Tell</em>, a work by Friedrich Schiller—the man is standing right in the thick of it, in the stream of heroic story. One who announces the murder of the tyrant to a sleeping people.39</p>
<p>We have arrived at the inn, a country tavern—a reasonably clean parlor—a few men sit with beer in the corner. I am recognized as a “gentleman” and led into the better corner where a chequered cloth covers the end of a table. The other sits down at the far end of the table, and I decide to have him served a proper evening meal. He is already looking at me full of expectation and hunger—with his one eye.</p>
<p>I: “Where did you lose your eye?”</p>
<p>He: “In a brawl. But I also got my knife into the other fellow pretty nicely. After that he got three months. They gave me six. But it was beautiful in prison. At the time the building was completely new. I worked in the locksmith’s. There wasn’t much to do and yet there was enough to eat. Prison really isn’t all that bad.”</p>
<p>I look around to make sure that no one is listening to me talking with a former convict. But no one seems to have noticed. I seem to have ended up in well-to-do company. Are there also prisons in Hell for those who never saw the inside of one while they were alive? Incidentally—mustn’t it be a peculiarly beautiful feeling to hit bottom in reality at least once, where there is no going down any further, but only upward beckons at best? Where for once one stands before the whole height of reality?</p>
<p>He: “So after that there I was, out on the street, since they banished me. Then I went to France. It was lovely there.”</p>
<p>What demands beauty makes! Something can be learned from this man.</p>
<p>I: “Why did you have this brawl?”</p>
<p>He: “It was over a woman. She was carrying his bastard but I wanted to marry her. She was already due. After that she didn’t want to anymore. I haven’t heard from her.”</p>
<p>I: “How old are you now?”</p>
<p>He: “I’ll be thirty-five in spring. Once I find a proper job we can get married right off. I’ll find myself one, I will. There’s something wrong with my lungs, though. But that’ll soon get better again.”</p>
<p>12/13 He has a coughing fit. I think that the prospects are not good and silently admire the poor devil’s unswerving optimism.</p>
<p>After dinner I go to bed in a humble room. I hear how the other settles into his lodging for the night next door. He coughs several times. Then he falls still. Suddenly I awaken again at an uncanny moan and gurgle mixed with a half-stifled cough. I listen tensely—no doubt, it’s him. It sounds like something dangerous. I jump up and throw something on. I open the door of his room. Moonlight floods it. The man lies still dressed on a sack of straw. A dark stream of blood is flowing from his mouth and forming a puddle on the floor. He moans half choking and coughs out blood. He wants to get up but sinks back again—I hurry to support him but I see that the hand of death lies on him. He is sullied with blood twice over. My hands are covered with it. A rattling sigh escapes from him. Then every stiffness loosens, a gentle shudder passes over his limbs. And then everything is deathly still.</p>
<p>Where am I? Are there also cases of death in Hell for those who have never thought about death? I look at my bloodstained hands—as if I were a murderer. . . Is it not the blood of my brother that sticks to my hands? The moon paints my shadow black on the white walls of the chamber. What am I doing here? Why this horrible drama? I look inquiringly at the moon as a witness. How does this concern the moon? Has it not already seen worse? Has it not shone a hundred thousand times into broken eyes? This is certainly of no avail to its eternal craters—one more or less. Death? Does it not uncover the terrible deceit of life? Therefore it is probably all the same to the moon, whether and how one passes away. Only we kick up a fuss about it—with what right?</p>
<p>What did this one do? He worked, lazed about, laughed, drank, ate, slept, gave his eye for the woman, and for her sake forfeited his good name; furthermore, he lived the human myth after a fashion, he admired the wonder-workers, praised the death of the tyrant, and vaguely dreamed of the freedom of the people. And then—then he miserably died—like everyone else. That is generally valid. I sat down on the floor. What shadows over the earth! All lights gutter out in final despondency and loneliness. Death has entered—and there is no one left to grieve. This is a final truth and no riddle. What delusion could make us believe in riddles?</p>
<p>[2] We stand on the spiky stones of misery and death.</p>
<p>A destitute joins me and wants admittance into my soul, and I am thus not destitute enough. Where was my destitution when I did not live it? I was a player at life, one who thought earnestly about life and lived it easily. The destitute was far away and forgotten. Life had become difficult and murkier. Winter kept on going, and the destitute stood in snow and froze. I join myself with him, since I need him. He makes living light and easy. He leads to the depths, to the ground where I can see the heights. Without the depths, I do not have the heights. I may be on the heights, but precisely because of that I do not become aware of the heights. I therefore need the bottommost for my renewal. If I am always on the heights, I wear them out and the best becomes atrocious to me.</p>
<p>But because I do not want to have it, my best becomes a horror to me. Because of that I myself become a horror, a horror to myself and to others, and a bad spirit of torment. Be respectful and know that your best has become a horror, with that you save yourself and others from useless torment. A man who can no longer climb down from his heights is sick, and he brings himself and others to torment. If you have reached your depths, then you see your height light up brightly over you, worthy of desire and far-off, as if unreachable, since secretly you would prefer not to reach it since it seems unattainable to you. For you also love to praise your heights when you are low and to tell yourself that you would have only left them with pain, and that you did not live so long as you missed them. It is a good thing that you have almost become the other nature that makes you speak this way. But at bottom you know that it is not quite true.</p>
<p>At your low point you are no longer distinct from your fellow beings. You are not ashamed and do not regret it, since insofar as you live the life of your fellow beings and descend to their lowliness 13/14 you also climb into the holy stream of common life, where you are no longer an individual on a high mountain, but a fish among fish, a frog among frogs.</p>
<p>Your heights are your own mountain, which belongs to you and you alone. There you are individual and live your very own life. If you live your own life, you do not live the common life, which is always continuing and never-ending, the life of history and the inalienable and ever-present burdens and products of the human race. There you live the endlessness of being, but not the becoming. Becoming belongs to the heights and is full of torment. How can you become if you never are? Therefore you need your bottommost, since there you are. But therefore you also need your heights, since there you become.</p>
<p>If you live the common life at your lowest reaches, then you become aware of your self. If you are on your heights, then you are your best, and you become aware only of your best, but not that which you are in the general life as a being. What one is as one who becomes, no one knows. But on the heights, imagination is at its strongest. For we imagine that we know what we are as developing beings, and even more so, the less we want to know what we are as beings. Because of that we do not love the condition of our being brought low, although or rather precisely because only there do we attain clear knowledge of ourselves.</p>
<p>Everything is riddlesome to one who is becoming, but not to one who is. He who suffers from riddles should take thought of his lowest condition; we solve those riddles from which we suffer, but not those which please us.</p>
<p>To be that which you are is the bath of rebirth. In the depths, being is not an unconditional persistence but an endlessly slow growth. You think you are standing still like swamp water, but slowly you flow into the sea that covers the earth’s greatest deeps, and is so vast that firm land seems only an island imbedded in the womb of the immeasurable sea.</p>
<p>As a drop in the ocean you take part in the current, ebb and flow. You swell slowly on the land and slowly sink back again in interminably slow breaths. You wander vast distances in blurred currents and wash up on strange shores, not knowing how you got there. You mount the billows of huge storms and are swept back again into the depths. And you do not know how this happens to you. You had thought that your movement came from you and that it needed your decisions and efforts, so that you could get going and make progress. But with every conceivable effort you would never have achieved that movement and reached those areas to which the sea and the great wind of the world brought you.</p>
<p>From endless blue plains you sink into black depths; luminous fish draw you, marvelous branches twine around you from above. You slip through columns and twisting, wavering, dark-leaved plants, and the sea takes you up again in bright green water to white, sandy coasts, and a wave foams you ashore and swallows you back again, and a wide smooth swell lifts you softly and leads you again to new regions, to twisting plants, to slowly creeping slimy polyps, and to green water and white sand and breaking surf.</p>
<p>But from far off your heights shine to you above the sea in a golden light, like the moon emerging from the tide, and you become aware of yourself from afar. And longing seizes you and the will for your own movement. You want to cross over from being to becoming, since you have recognized the breath of the sea, and its flowing, that leads you here and there without your ever adhering; you have also recognized its surge that bears you to alien shores and carries you back, and gargles you up and down.</p>
<p>You saw that it was the life of the whole and the death of each individual. You felt yourself entwined in the collective death, from death to the earth’s deepest place, from death in your own strangely breathing depths. Oh—you long to be beyond; despair and mortal fear seize you in this death that breathes slowly and streams back and forth eternally. All this light and dark, warm, tepid, and cold water, all these wavy, swaying, twisting plantlike animals and bestial plants, all these nightly wonders become a horror to you, and you long for the sun, for light dry air, for firm stones, for a fixed place and straight lines, for the motionless and firmly held, for rules and preconceived purpose, for singleness and your own intent.</p>
<p>The knowledge of death came to me that night, from the dying that engulfs the world. I saw how we live toward death, how the swaying golden wheat sinks together under the scythe of the reaper, 14/15 like a smooth wave on the sea-beach. He who abides in common life becomes aware of death with fear. Thus the fear of death drives him toward singleness. He does not live there, but he becomes aware of life and is happy, since in singleness he is one who becomes, and has overcome death. He overcomes death through overcoming common life. He does not live his individual being, since he is not what he is, but what he becomes.</p>
<p>One who becomes grows aware of life, whereas one who simply exists never will, since he is in the midst of life. He needs the heights and singleness to become aware of life. But in life he becomes aware of death. And it is good that you become aware of collective death, since then you know why your singleness and your heights are good. Your heights are like the moon that luminously wanders alone and through the night looks eternally clear. Sometimes it covers itself and then you are totally in the darkness of the earth, but time and again it fills itself out with light. The death of the earth is foreign to it. Motionless and clear, it sees the life of the earth from afar, without enveloping haze and streaming oceans. Its unchanging form has been solid from eternity. It is the solitary clear light of the night, the individual being, and the near fragment of eternity.</p>
<p>From there you look out, cold, motionless, and radiating. With otherworldly silvery light and green twilights, you pour out into the distant horror. You see it but your gaze is clear and cold. Your hands are red from living blood, but the moonlight of your gaze is motionless. It is the life blood of your brother, yes, it is your own blood, but your gaze remains luminous and embraces the entire horror and the earth’s round. Your gaze rests on silvery seas, on snowy peaks, on blue valleys, and you do not hear the groaning and howling of the human animal.</p>
<p>The moon is dead. Your soul went to the moon, to the preserver of souls.40 Thus the soul moved toward death.41 I went into the inner death and saw that outer dying is better than inner death. And I decided to die outside and to live within. For that reason I turned away42 and sought the place of the inner life.</p>
<p>The Anchorite</p>
<p>Cap. iv. Dies I.43</p>
<p>[HI 15] On the following night,44 I found myself on new paths; hot dry air flowed around me, and I saw the desert, yellow sand all around, heaped up in waves, a terrible irascible sun, a sky as blue as tarnished steel, the air shimmering above the earth, on my right side a deeply cut valley with a dry river bed, some languid grass and dusty brambles. In the sand I see the tracks of naked feet that lead up from the rocky valley to the plateau. I follow them along a high dune. Where it falls off, the tracks move off to the other side. They appear to be fresh, and old half-worn-away footprints run alongside. I pursue them attentively: again they follow the slope of the dune, now they flow into another set of footprints—but it is the same 15/16 set that I have already followed, the one ascending from the valley.</p>
<p>Henceforth I follow the footprints downward in astonishment. I soon reach the hot red rocks corroded by the wind. On the stone the footprints are lost but I see where the rock falls off in layers and I climb down. The air glows and the rock burns my soles. Now I have reached the bottom; there are the tracks again. They lead along the winding of the valley, a short distance. Suddenly I stand before a small hut covered in reeds and made of mud bricks. A rickety wooden plank forms the door where a cross has been painted in red. I open it quietly. A haggard man covered in a white linen mantle is sitting on a mat with his back leaning against the wall. Across his knees lies a book in yellow parchment, with beautiful black handwriting—a Greek gospel, without doubt. I am with an anchorite of the Libyan desert.45</p>
<p>I: “Am I disturbing you, father?”</p>
<p>A: “You do not disturb me. But do not call me father. I am a man like you. What is your desire?”</p>
<p>I: “I come without desire, I have come to this place in the desert by chance, and found tracks in the sand up there that led me in a circle to you.”</p>
<p>A: “You found the tracks of my daily walks at daybreak and sunset.”</p>
<p>I: “Excuse me if I interrupt your devotion, it is a rare opportunity for me to be with you. I have never before seen an anchorite.”</p>
<p>A: “There are several others whom you can see further down in this valley. Some have huts like me, others live in the graves that the ancients have hollowed out in these rocks. I live uppermost in the valley, because it is most solitary and quiet here, and because here I am closest to the peace of the desert.”</p>
<p>I: “Have you already been here long?”</p>
<p>A: “I have lived here for perhaps ten years, but really, I can no longer remember exactly how long it is. It could also be a few more years. Time passes so quickly.”</p>
<p>I: “Time passes quickly? How is that possible? Your life must be frightfully monotonous.”</p>
<p>A: “Time certainly passes quickly for me. Much too quickly even. It seems you are a pagan?”</p>
<p>I: “Me? No—not exactly. I was raised in the Christian faith.”</p>
<p>A: “Well, then, how can you ask whether time drags on for me? You must know what preoccupies a man who is grieving. Only idlers grow bored.”</p>
<p>I: “Again, forgive me, my curiosity is great, what then do you occupy yourself with?”</p>
<p>A: “Are you a child? To begin with you see that I am reading, and that I keep regular hours.”</p>
<p>I: “But I can see nothing at all with which you could occupy yourself here. You must have read this book from cover to cover often enough. And if it is the gospels, as I suppose, then I am sure you already know them by heart.”</p>
<p>A: “How childishly you speak! Surely you know that one can read a book many times—perhaps you almost know it by heart, and nevertheless it can be that, when you look again at the lines before you, certain things appear new or even new thoughts occur to you that you did not have before. Every word can work productively in your spirit. And finally if you have once left the book for a week and you take it up again after your spirit has experienced various different changes, then a number of things will dawn on you.”</p>
<p>I: “I have difficulty grasping this. The book remains one and the same, certainly a wonderfully profound, yes, even divine matter, but surely not rich enough to fill countless years.”</p>
<p>A: “You are astonishing. How, then, do you read this holy book? Do you really always see only one and the same meaning in it? Where do you come from? You are truly a pagan.”</p>
<p>I: “I beg you, please don’t hold it against me if I read like a pagan. Let me talk with you. I am here to learn from you. Consider me as an ignorant student, which I am in these matters.”</p>
<p>A: “If I call you a pagan, don’t take it as an insult. I used to be a pagan, too, exactly like you as I 16/17 well remember. Therefore how can I blame you for your ignorance?”</p>
<p>I: “Thank you for your patience. But it matters very much to me to know how you read and what you take from this book.”</p>
<p>A: “Your question is not easy to answer. It’s easier to explain colors to a blind person. You must know one thing above all: a succession of words does not have only one meaning. But men strive to assign only a single meaning to the sequence of words, in order to have an unambiguous language. This striving is worldly and constricted, and belongs to the deepest layers of the divine creative plan. On the higher levels of insight into divine thoughts, you recognize that the sequence of words has more than one valid meaning. Only to the all-knowing is it given to know all the meanings of the sequence of words. Increasingly we try to grasp a few more meanings.”</p>
<p>I: “If I understand you correctly, you think that the holy writings of the New Testament also have a doubleness, an exoteric and an esoteric meaning, as a few Jewish scholars contend concerning their holy books.”</p>
<p>A: “This bad superstition is far from me. I observe that you are wholly inexperienced in divine matters.”</p>
<p>I: “I must confess my deep ignorance about these things. But I am eager to experience and understand what you think about the multifaceted meaning of the sequence of words.”</p>
<p>A: “Unfortunately I am in no position to tell you everything I know about it. But at least I will try to make the elements clear to you. Because of your ignorance I will therefore begin elsewhere this time: What you need to know is that before I became acquainted with Christianity, I was a rhetorician and philosopher in the city of Alexandria. I had a great throng of students, including many Romans, a few barbarians, and also some Gauls and Britons. I taught them not only the history of Greek philosophy but also the new systems, among them the system of Philo, whom we call the Jew.46 He was a clever head, but fantastically abstract, as the Jews are wont to be when they devise systems; moreover he was a slave of his own words. I added my own, and wove an atrocious web of words in which I ensnared not only my listeners, but also myself. We rioted terribly among words and names, our own miserable creatures, and accorded divine potency to them. Yes, we even believed in their reality, and believed that we possessed the divine and had committed it to words.”</p>
<p>I: “But Philo Judeaus, if this is who you mean, was a serious philosopher and a great thinker. Even John the Evangelist included some of Philo’s thoughts in the gospel.”</p>
<p>A: “You are right. It is to Philo’s credit that he furnished language like so many other philosophers. He belongs to the language artists. But words should not become Gods.”47</p>
<p>I: “I fail to understand you here. Does it not say in the gospel according to John: God was the Word. It appears to make quite explicit the point which you have just now rejected.”</p>
<p>A: “Guard against being a slave to words. Here is the gospel: read from that passage where it says: In him was the life. What does John say there?”48</p>
<p>I: “ ‘And life was the light of men and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not understood it. But it became a person sent from God, by the name of John, who came as a witness and to be a witness of the light. The genuine light, which illuminates each person, came into the world: He was in the world, and the world became through him, and the world did not recognize him.’—That is what I read here. But what do you make of this?”</p>
<p>A: “I ask you, was this ΛΟΓΟΣ [Logos] a concept, a word? It was a light, indeed a man, and lived among men. You see, Philo only lent John the word so that John would have at his disposal the word ‘ΛΟΓΟΣ’ alongside the word ‘light’ to describe the son of man. John gave to living men the meaning of the ΛΟΓΟΣ, but Philo gave ΛΟΓΟΣ as the dead concept that usurped life, even the divine life. Through this the dead does not gain life, and the living is killed. And this was also my atrocious error.”</p>
<p>I: “I see what you mean. This thought is new to me and seems worth consideration. Until now it always seemed to me 17/18 as if it were exactly that which was meaningful in John, namely that the son of man is the ΛΟΓΟΣ, in that he thus elevates the lower to the higher spirit, to the world of the ΛΟΓΟΣ. But you lead me to see the matter conversely, namely that John brings the meaning of the ΛΟΓΟΣ down to man.”</p>
<p>A: “I learned to see that John has in fact even done the great service of having brought the meaning of the ΛΟΓΟΣ up to man.”</p>
<p>I: “You have peculiar insights that stretch my curiosity to the utmost. How is that? Do you think that the human stands higher than the ΛΟΓΟΣ?”</p>
<p>A: “I want to answer this question within the scope of your understanding: if the human God had not become important above everything, he would not have appeared as the son in the flesh, but in the ΛΟΓΟΣ.”49</p>
<p>I: “That makes sense to me, but I confess that this view is surprising to me. It is especially astonishing to me that you, a Christian anchorite, have come to such views. I would not have expected this of you.”</p>
<p>A: “As I have already noticed, you have a completely false idea of me and my essence. Let me give you a small example of my preoccupation. I’ve spent many years alone with the process of unlearning. Have you ever unlearned anything?—Well, then you should know how long it takes. And I was a successful teacher. As you know, for such people to unlearn is difficult or even impossible. But I see that the sun has gone down. Soon it will be completely dark. Night is the time of silence. I want to show you your place for the night. I need the morning for my work, but after midday you can come to me again if you like. Then we will continue our conversation.”</p>
<p>He leads me out of the hut, the valley is covered in blue shadows. The first stars are already glittering in the sky. He leads me around the corner of a rock: we are standing at the entrance of a50 grave cut into the stone. We step in. Not far from the entrance lies a heap of reeds covered with mats. Next to it there is a pitcher of water, and on a white cloth there are dried dates and black bread.</p>
<p>A: “Here is your place and your supper. Sleep well, and do not forget your morning prayer, when the sun rises.”</p>
<p>[2] The solitary lives in endless desert full of awesome beauty. He looks at the whole and at inner meaning. He loathes manifold diversity if it is near him. He looks at it from afar in its totality. Consequently silvery splendor and joy and beauty cloak diversity for him. What is near him must be simple and innocent, since close at hand the manifold and complicated tear and break through the silvery splendor. No cloudiness of the sky, no haze or mist is allowed to be around him, otherwise he cannot look at the distant manifold in the whole. Consequently the solitary loves the desert above all, where everything nearby is simple and nothing turbid or blurred lies between him and the far-away.</p>
<p><em>The life of the solitary would be cold were it not for the immense sun, which makes the air and rocks glow. The sun and its eternal splendor replace for the solitary his own life warmth.</em></p>
<p><em>His heart longs for the sun.</em></p>
<p><em>He wanders to the lands of the sun.</em></p>
<p><em>He dreams of the flickering splendor of the sun, of the hot red stones spread out at midday, of the golden hot rays of dry sand.</em> 18/19</p>
<p><em>The solitary seeks the sun and no one else is so ready to open his heart as he is. Therefore he loves the desert above all, since he loves its deep stillness.</em></p>
<p><em>He needs little food since the sun and its glow nourish him. Consequently the solitary loves the desert above all since it is a mother to him, giving him food and invigorating warmth at regular hours.</em></p>
<p><em>In the desert the solitary is relieved of care and therefore turns his whole life to the sprouting garden of his soul, which can flourish only under a hot sun. In his garden the delicious red fruit grows that bears swelling sweetness under a tight skin.</em></p>
<p><em>You think that the solitary is poor. You do not see that he strolls under laden fruit trees and that his hand touches grain a hundredfold. Under dark leaves the overfull reddish blossoms swell toward him from abundant buds, and the fruit almost bursts with thronging juices. Fragrant resins drip from his trees and under his feet thrusting seed breaks open.</em></p>
<p><em>If the sun sinks onto the plane of the sea like an exhausted bird, the solitary envelops himself and holds his breath. He does not move and is pure expectancy until the miracle of the renewal of light rises in the East.</em></p>
<p>*Brimful delicious expectation is in the solitary.*51</p>
<p><em>The horror of the desert and of withered evaporation surround him, and you do not understand how the solitary can live.</em> 19/20</p>
<p><em>But his eye rests on the garden, and his ears listen to the source, and his hand touches velvet leaves and fruit, and his breath draws in sweet perfumes from blossom-rich trees.</em></p>
<p><em>He cannot tell you, since the splendor of his garden is so abundant. He stammers when he speaks of it, and he appears to you to be poor in spirit and in life. But his hand does not know where it should reach, in all this indescribable fullness.</em></p>
<p><em>He gives you a small insignificant fruit, which has just fallen at his feet. It appears worthless to you, but if you consider it, you will see that this fruit tastes like a sun which you could not have dreamt of. It gives off a perfume which confuses your senses and makes you dream of rose gardens and sweet wine and whispering palm trees. And you hold this one fruit in your hands dreaming, and you would like the tree in which it grows, the garden in which this tree stands, and the sun which brought forth this garden.</em></p>
<p><em>And you yourself want to be that solitary who strolls with the sun in his garden, his gaze resting on pendant flowers and his hand brushing a hundredfold of grain and his breath drinking the perfume from a thousand roses.</em></p>
<p><em>Dull from the sun and drunk from fermenting wines, you lie down in ancient graves, whose walls resound with many voices and many colors of a thousand solar years.</em></p>
<p><em>When you grow, then you see everything living again as it was. And</em> 20/21 <em>when you sleep, you rest, like everything that was, and your dreams echo softly again from distant temple chants.</em></p>
<p><em>You sleep down through the thousand solar years, and you wake up through the thousand solar years, and your dreams full of ancient lore adorn the walls of your bedchamber.</em></p>
<p><em>You also see yourself in the totality.</em></p>
<p>You sit and lean against the wall, and look at the beautiful, riddlesome totality. The Summa52 lies before you like a book, and an unspeakable greed seizes you to devour it. Consequently you lean back and stiffen and sit for a long time. You are completely incapable of grasping it. Here and there a light flickers, here and there a fruit falls from high trees which you can grasp, here and there your foot strikes gold. But what is it, if you compare it with the totality, which lies spread out tangibly close to you? You stretch out your hand, but it remains hanging in invisible webs. You want to see it exactly as it is but something cloudy and opaque pushes itself exactly in between. You would like to tear a piece out of it; it is smooth and impenetrable like polished steel. So you sink back against the wall, and when you have crawled through all the glowing hot crucibles of the Hell of doubt, you sit once more and lean back, and look at the wonder of the Summa that lies spread out before you. Here and there a light flickers, here and there a fruit falls. For you it is all too little. But you begin to be satisfied with yourself, and you pay no attention to the years passing away. What are years? What is hurrying time to him that sits under a tree? Your time passes like a breath of air and you wait for the next light, the next fruit.</p>
<p>The writing lies before you and always says the same, if you believe in words. But if you believe in things in whose places only words stand, you never come to the end. And yet you must go an endless road, since life flows not only down a finite path but also an infinite one. But the unbounded makes you53 anxious since the unbounded is fearful and your humanity rebels against it. Consequently you seek limits and restraints so that you do not lose yourself, tumbling into infinity. Restraint becomes imperative for you. You cry out for the word which has one meaning and no other, so that you escape boundless ambiguity. The word becomes your God, since it protects you from the countless possibilities of interpretation. The word is protective magic against the daimons of the unending, which tear at your soul and want to scatter you to the winds. You are saved if you can say at last: that is that and only that. You speak the magic word, and the limitless is finally banished. Because of that men seek and make words.54</p>
<p>He who breaks the wall of words overthrows Gods and defiles temples. The solitary is a murderer. He murders the people, because he thus thinks and thereby breaks down ancient sacred walls. He calls up the daimons of the boundless. And he sits, leans back, and does not hear the groans of mankind, whom the fearful fiery smoke has seized. And yet you cannot find the new words if you do not shatter the old words. But no one should shatter the old words, unless he finds the new word that is a firm rampart against the limitless and grasps more life in it than in the old word. A new word is a new God for old men. Man remains the same, even if you create a new model of God for him. He remains an imitator. What was word, shall become man. The word created the world and came before the world. It lit up like a light in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.55 And thus the word should become what the darkness can comprehend, since what use is the light if the darkness does not comprehend it? But your darkness should grasp the light.</p>
<p>The God of words is cold and dead and shines from afar like the moon, mysteriously and inaccessibly. Let the word return to its 21/22 creator, to man, and thus the word will be heightened in man. Man should be light, limits, measure. May he be your fruit, for which you longingly reach. The darkness does not comprehend the word, but rather man; indeed, it seizes him, since he himself is a piece of the darkness. Not from the word down to man, but from the word up to man: that is what the darkness comprehends. The darkness is your mother; she behooves reverence, since the mother is dangerous. She has power over you, since she gave birth to you. Honor the darkness as the light, and you will illumine your darkness.</p>
<p>If you comprehend the darkness, it seizes you. It comes over you like the night with black shadows and countless shimmering stars. Silence and peace come over you if you begin to comprehend the darkness. Only he who does not comprehend the darkness fears the night. Through comprehending the dark, the nocturnal, the abyssal in you, you become utterly simple. And you prepare to sleep through the millennia like everyone else, and you sleep down into the womb of the millennia, and your walls resound with ancient temple chants. Since the simple is what always was. Peace and blue night spread over you while you dream in the grave of the millennia.</p>
<p>Dies II.56</p>
<p>Cap. v.</p>
<p>[HI 22] 57, 58I awaken, the day reddens the East. A night, a wonderful night in the distant depths of time lies behind me. In what far-away space was I? What did I dream? Of a white horse? It seems to me as if I had seen this white horse on the Eastern sky over the rising sun. The horse spoke to me: What did it say? It said: “Hail him who is in darkness since the day is over him.” There were four white horses, each with golden wings. They led the carriage of the sun, on which Helios stood with flaring mane.59 I stood down in the gorge, astonished and frightened. A thousand black serpents crawled swiftly into their holes. Helios ascended, rolling upward toward the wide paths of the sky. I knelt down, raised my hands suppliantly, and called: “Give us your light, you are flame-curled, entwined, crucified and revived; give us your light, your light!” This cry woke me. Didn’t Ammonius say yesterday evening: “Do not forget to say your morning prayer when the sun rises.” I thought that perhaps he secretly worships the sun. 22/23</p>
<p>Outside a fresh morning wind rises. Yellow sand trickles in fine veins down the rocks. The redness expands across the sky and I see the first rays shoot up to the firmament. Solemn calm and solitude on all sides. A large lizard lies on a stone and awaits the sun. I stand as if spellbound and laboriously remember everything from yesterday, especially what Ammonius said. But what did he say? That the sequences of words have many meanings, and that John brought the ΛΟΓΟΣ to man. But that does not sound properly Christian. Is he perhaps a Gnostic?60 No, that seems impossible to me, since they were really the worst of all the idolators of words, as he would probably put it.</p>
<p>The sun—what fills me with such inner exaltation? I should not forget my morning prayer—but where has my morning prayer gone? Dear sun, I have no prayer, since I do not know how one must address you. Have I already prayed to the sun? But Ammonius really meant that I should pray to God at the break of day. He probably does not know—we have no more prayers. How should he know about our nakedness and poverty? What has happened to our prayers? I miss them here. This must really be because of the desert. It seems as if there ought to be prayers here. Is this desert so very bad? I think it is no worse than our cities. But why then do we not pray there? I must look toward the sun, as if it had something to do with this. Alas—one can never escape the age-old dreams of mankind.</p>
<p>What shall I do this whole long morning? I do not understand how Ammonius could have endured this life for even a year. I go back and forth on the dried-up river bed and finally sit down on a boulder. Before me there are a few yellow grasses. Over there a small dark beetle is crawling along, pushing a ball in front of it—a scarab.61 You dear little animal, are you still toiling away in order to live your beautiful myth? How seriously and undiscouraged it works! If only you had a notion that you are performing an old myth, you would probably renounce your fantasies as we men have also given up playing at mythology.</p>
<p>The unreality nauseates one. What I say sounds very odd in this place, and the good Ammonious would certainly not agree with it. What am I actually doing here? No, I don’t want to condemn him in advance, since I still haven’t really understood what he actually means. He has a right to be heard. By the way, I thought differently yesterday. I was even very thankful to him that he wanted to teach me. But I’m being critical once again, and superior, and may well learn nothing. His thoughts are not that bad at all; they are even good. I don’t know why I always want to put the man down.</p>
<p>Dear beetle, where have you gone? I can no longer see you—Oh, you’re already over there with your mythical ball. These little animals stick to things, quite unlike us—no doubt, no change of mind, no hesitation. Is this so because they live their myth?</p>
<p><em>Dear scarab, my father, I honor you, blessèd be your work—in eternity— Amen.</em></p>
<p>What nonsense am I talking? I’m worshiping an animal—that must be because of the desert. It seems absolutely to demand prayers.</p>
<p>How beautiful it is here! The reddish color of the stones is wonderful; they reflect the glow of a hundred thousand past suns—these small grains of sand have rolled in fabulous primordial oceans, over them swam primordial monsters with forms never beheld before. Where were you, man, in those days? On this warm sand lay your childish primordial animal ancestors, like children snuggling up to their mother.</p>
<p><em>O mother stone, I love you, I lie snuggled up against your warm body, your late child. Blessèd be you, ancient mother.</em></p>
<p>23/24 <em>Yours is my heart and all glory and power—Amen.</em></p>
<p>What am I saying? That was the desert. How everything appears so animated to me! This place is truly terrible. These stones—are they stones? They seem to have gathered here deliberately. They’re lined up like a troop transport. They’ve arranged themselves by size, the large ones stand apart, the small ones close ranks and gather in groups that precede the large ones. Here the stones form states.</p>
<p>Am I dreaming or am I awake? It’s hot—the sun already stands high—how the hours pass! Truly, the morning is nearly over—and how astonishing it has been! Is it the sun or is it these living stones, or is it the desert that makes my head buzz?</p>
<p>I go up the valley and before long I reach the hut of the anchorite. He is sitting on his mat lost in deep reflection.</p>
<p>I: “My father, I am here.”</p>
<p>A: “How have you spent your morning?”</p>
<p>I: “I was surprised when you said yesterday that time passes quickly for you. I don’t question you anymore and this will no longer surprise me. I’ve learned a lot. But only enough to make you an even greater riddle than you were before. Why, all the things that you must experience in the desert, you wonderful man! Even the stones are bound to speak to you.”</p>
<p>A: “I’m happy that you have learned to understand something of the life of an anchorite. That will make our difficult task easier. I don’t want to intrude on your mysteries, but I feel that you come from a strange world that has nothing to do with mine.”</p>
<p>I: “You speak truthfully. I’m a stranger here, more foreign than any you’ve ever seen. Even a man from Britain’s remotest coast is closer to you than I am. Therefore have patience, master—and let me drink from the source of your wisdom. Although the thirsty desert surrounds us, an invisible stream of living water flows here.”</p>
<p>A: “Have you said your prayer?”</p>
<p>I: “Master, forgive me: I’ve tried, but I found no prayer. Yet I dreamed that I prayed to the rising sun.”</p>
<p>A: “Don’t worry yourself because of that. If you do find a word, your soul has nevertheless found inexpressible words to greet the break of day.”</p>
<p>I: “But it was a heathen prayer to Helios.”</p>
<p>A: “Let that suffice for you.”</p>
<p>I: “But Oh master, I’ve prayed not only to the sun in a dream, but in my absentmindedness also to the scarab and the earth.”</p>
<p>A: “Be astonished at nothing, and in no case condemn or regret it. Let us go to work. Do you want to ask something about the conversation we had yesterday?”</p>
<p>I: “I interrupted you yesterday when you spoke of Philo. You wanted to explain your notion of the various meanings of particular sequences of words.”</p>
<p>A: “Well, I’ll continue my account of how I was freed from the awful predicament of spinning words. A man my father had set free once came to me; this man, whom I’d been attached to since my childhood, spoke to me and said:</p>
<p>“Oh Ammonius, are you well?” “Certainly,” I said, “as you can see, I am learnèd and have great success.”</p>
<p>He: “I mean, are you happy and are you fully alive?”</p>
<p>I laughed: “As you can see, all is well.”</p>
<p>The old man replied: “I saw how you lectured. You seemed to be anxious at the judgment of your listeners. You wove witty jokes into the lecture to please your listeners. You heaped up learnèd expressions to impress them. You were restless and hasty, as if still compelled to snatch up all knowledge. You are not in yourself.”</p>
<p>Although these words at first seemed laughable to me, they still made an impression on me, and reluctantly I had to 24/25 credit the old man, since he was right.</p>
<p>Then he said: “Dear Ammonius, I have delightful tidings for you: God has become flesh in his son and has brought us all salvation.” “What are you saying,” I called, “you probably mean Osiris,62 who shall appear in the mortal body?”</p>
<p>“No,” he replied, “this man lived in Judea and was born from a virgin.”</p>
<p>I laughed and answered: “I already know about this; a Jewish trader has brought tidings of our virgin queen to Judea, whose image appears on the walls of one of our temples, and reported it as a fairy tale.”</p>
<p>“No,” the old man insisted, “he was the Son of God.”</p>
<p>“Then you mean Horus,63 the son of Osiris, don’t you?”</p>
<p>I answered.</p>
<p>“No, he was not Horus, but a real man, and he was hung from a cross.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but this must be Seth, surely, whose punishments our old ones have often described.”</p>
<p>But the old man stood by his conviction and said: “He died and rose up on the third day.”</p>
<p>“Well, then he must be Osiris,” I replied impatiently.</p>
<p>“No,” he cried, “he is called Jesus the anointed one.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you really mean this Jewish God, whom the poor honor at the harbor, and whose unclean mysteries they celebrate in cellars.”</p>
<p>“He was a man and yet the Son of God,” said the old man staring at me intently.</p>
<p>“That’s nonsense, dear old man,” I said, and showed him to the door. But like an echo from distant rock faces the words returned to me: a man and yet the Son of God. It seemed significant to me, and this phrase was what brought me to Christianity.</p>
<p>I: “But don’t you think that Christianity could ultimately be a transformation of your Egyptian teachings?”</p>
<p>A: “If you say that our old teachings were less adequate expressions of Christianity, then I’m more likely to agree with you.”</p>
<p>I: “Yes, but do you then assume that the history of religions is aimed at a final goal?”</p>
<p>A: “My father once bought a black slave at the market from the region of the source of the Nile. He came from a country that had heard of neither Osiris nor the other Gods; he told me many things in a more simple language that said the same as we believed about Osiris and the other Gods. I learned to understand that those uneducated Negroes unknowingly already possessed most of what the religions of the cultured peoples had developed into complete doctrines. Those able to read that language correctly could thus recognize in it not only the pagan doctrines but also the doctrine of Jesus. And it’s with this that I now occupy myself. I read the gospels and seek their meaning which is yet to come. We know their meaning as it lies before us, but not their hidden meaning which points to the future. It’s erroneous to believe that religions differ in their innermost essence. Strictly speaking, it’s always one and the same religion. Every subsequent form of religion is the meaning of the antecedent.”</p>
<p>I: “Have you found out the meaning which is yet to come?”</p>
<p>A: “No, not yet; it’s very difficult, but I hope I’ll succeed. Sometimes it seems to me that I need the stimulation of others, but I realize that those are temptations of Satan.”</p>
<p>I: “Don’t you believe that you’d succeed if you were nearer men?”</p>
<p>A: “Perhaps you’re right.”</p>
<p>He looks at me suddenly as if doubtful and suspicious. “But,” he continues, “I love the desert, do you understand? This yellow, sun-glowing desert. Here you can see the countenance of the sun every day, you are alone, you can see glorious Helios—no, that is pagan—what’s wrong with me? I’m confused—you are Satan—I recognize you—give way, adversary!”</p>
<p>25/26 He jumps up incensed and wants to lunge at me. But I am far away in the twentieth century.64</p>
<p>[2][HI 26] <em>He who sleeps in the grave of the millennia dreams a wonderful dream. He dreams a primordially ancient dream. He dreams of the rising sun.</em></p>
<p><em>If you sleep this sleep and dream this dream in this time of the world, you will know that the sun will also rise at this time. For the moment we are still in the dark, but the day is upon us.</em></p>
<p><em>He who comprehends the darkness in himself, to him the light is near. He who climbs down into his darkness reaches the staircase of the working light, fire-maned Helios.</em></p>
<p><em>His chariot ascends with four white horses, his back bears no cross, and his side no wound, but he is safe and his head blazes in the fire.</em></p>
<p><em>Nor is he a man of mockery, but of splendor and unquestionable force.</em></p>
<p><em>I do not know what I speak, I speak in a dream. Support me for I stagger, drunk with fire. I drank fire in this night, since I climbed down through the centuries and plunged into the sun far at the bottom. And I rose up drunk from the sun, with a burning countenance and my head is ablaze.</em></p>
<p><em>Give me your hand, a human hand, so that you</em> 26/27 <em>can hold me to the earth with it, for whirling veins of fire swoop me up, and exultant longing tears me toward the zenith.</em></p>
<p>But day is about to break, actual day, the day of this world. And I remain concealed in the gorge of the earth, deep down and solitary, and in the darkening shadows of the valley. That is the shadow and heaviness of the earth.</p>
<p>How can I pray to the sun, that rises far in the East over the desert? Why should I pray to it? I drink the sun within me, so why should I pray to it? But the desert, the desert in me demands prayers, since the desert wants to satisfy itself with what is alive. I want to beg God for it, the sun, or one of the other immortals.</p>
<p>I beg because I am empty and am a beggar. In the day of this world, I forget that I drank the sun and am drunk from its active light and singeing power. But I stepped into the shadows of the earth, and saw that I am naked and have nothing to cover my poverty. No sooner do you touch the earth than your inner life is over; it flees from you into things.</p>
<p>And a wondrous life arises in things. What you thought was dead and inanimate betrays a secret life and silent, inexorable intent. You have got caught up in a hustle and bustle where everything goes its own way with strange gestures, beside you, above you, beneath you, and through you; even the stones speak to you, and magical threads spin from you to things and from things to you. Far and near work within you and you work in a dark manner upon the near and the far. And you are always helpless and a prey.</p>
<p>But if you watch closely, you will see what you have never seen before, namely that things live your life, and that they live off you: the rivers bear your life to the valley, one stone falls upon another with your force, plants and animals also grow through you and they are the cause of your death. A leaf dancing in the wind dances with you; the irrational animal65 guesses your thought and represents you. The whole earth sucks its life from you and everything reflects you again.</p>
<p>Nothing happens in which you are not entangled in a secret manner; for everything has ordered itself around you and plays your innermost. Nothing in you is hidden to things, no matter how remote, how precious, how secret it is. It inheres in things. Your dog robs you of your father, who passed away long ago, and looks at you as he did. The cow in the meadow has intuited your mother, and charms you with total calm and security. The stars whisper your deepest mysteries to you, and the soft valleys of the earth rescue you in a motherly womb.</p>
<p>Like a stray child you stand pitifully among the mighty, who hold the threads of your life. You cry for help and attach yourself to the first person that comes your way. Perhaps he can advise you, perhaps he knows the thought that you do not have, and which all things have sucked out of you.</p>
<p><em>I know that you would like to hear the tidings of he whom things have not lived, but who lived and fulfilled himself. For you are a son of the earth, sucked dry by the suckling earth, that can suck nothing out of itself, but suckles only from the sun. Therefore you would like to have tidings of the son of the sun, which shines and does not suckle.</em></p>
<p>27/28 <em>You would like to hear of the son of God, who shone and gave, who begot, and to whom life was born again, as the earth bears the sun green and colorful children.</em></p>
<p><em>You would like to hear of him, the radiating savior, who as a son of the sun cut through the webs of the earth, who sundered the magic threads and released those in bondage, who owned himself and was no one’s servant, who sucked no one dry, and whose treasure no one exhausted.</em></p>
<p><em>You would like to hear of him who was not darkened by the shadow of earth, but illuminated it, who saw the thoughts of all, and whose thoughts no one guessed, who possessed in himself the meaning of all things, and whose meaning no thing could express</em>.</p>
<p>The solitary fled the world; he closed his eyes, plugged his ears and buried himself in a cave within himself, but it was no use. The desert sucked him dry, the stones spoke his thoughts, the cave echoed his feelings, and so he himself became desert, stone, and cave. And it was all emptiness and desert, and helplessness and barrenness, since he did not shine and remained a son of the earth who sucked a book dry and was sucked empty by the desert. He was desire and not splendor, completely earth and not sun.</p>
<p>Consequently he was in the desert as a clever saint who very well knew that otherwise he was no different from the other sons of the earth. If he would have drunk of himself, he would have drunk fire.</p>
<p>The solitary went into the desert to find himself. But he did not want to find himself, but rather the manifold meaning of holy scripture. You can suck the immensity of the small and the great into yourself, and you will become emptier and emptier, since immense fullness and immense emptiness are one and the same.66</p>
<p>He wanted to find what he needed in the outer. But you find manifold meaning only in yourself, not in things, since the manifoldness of meaning is not something that is given at the same time, but is a succession of meanings. The meanings that follow one another do not lie in things, but lie in you, who are subject to many changes, insofar as you take part in life. Things also change, but you do not notice this if you do not change. But if you change, the countenance of the world alters. The manifold sense of things is your manifold sense. It is useless to fathom it in things. And this probably explains why the solitary went into the desert, and fathomed the thing but not himself.</p>
<p>And therefore what happened to every desirous solitary also happened to him: the devil came to him with smooth tongue and clear reasoning and knew the right word at the right moment. He lured him to his desire. I had to appear to him as the devil, since I had accepted my darkness. I ate the earth and I drank the sun, and I became a greening tree that stands alone and grows.6728/29</p>
<p>Death.68</p>
<p>Cap. vi.</p>
<p>[HI 29] On the following night,69 I wandered to the northern land and found myself under a gray sky in misty-hazy cool-moist air. I strive to those lowlands where the weak currents, flashing in broad mirrors, stream toward the sea, where all haste of flowing becomes more and more dampened, and where all power and all striving unites with the immeasurable extent of the sea. The trees become sparse, wide swamp meadows accompany the still, murky water, the horizon is unending and lonely, draped by gray clouds. Slowly, with restrained breath, and with the great and anxious expectation of one gliding downward wildly on the foam and pouring himself into endlessness, I follow my brother, the sea. It flows softly and almost imperceptibly, and yet we continually approach the supreme embrace, entering the womb of the source, the boundless expansion and immeasurable depths. Lower yellow hills rise there. A broad dead lake widens at their feet. We wander along the hills quietly and they open up to a dusky, unspeakably remote horizon, where the sky and the sea are fused into infinity.</p>
<p>Someone is standing there, on the last dune. He is wearing a black wrinkled coat; he stands motionless and looks into the distance. I go up to him—he is gaunt and with a deeply serious look in his eyes. I say to him:</p>
<p>“Let me stand beside you for a while, dark one. I recognized you from afar. There is only one who stands this way, so solitary and at the last corner of the world.”</p>
<p>He answered: “Stranger, you may well stand by me, if it is not too cold for you. As you can see, I am cold and my heart has never beaten.”</p>
<p>“I know, you are ice and the end; you are the cold silence of the stones; and you are the highest snow on the mountains and the most extreme frost of outer space. I must feel this and that’s why I stand near you.”</p>
<p>“What leads you here to me, you living matter? The living are never guests here. Well, they all flow past here sadly in dense crowds, all those above in the land of the clear day who have taken their departure, 29/30 never to return again. But the living never come here. What do you seek here?”</p>
<p>“My strange and unexpected path led me here as I happily followed the way of the living stream. And thus I found you. I gather this is your place, your rightful place?”</p>
<p>“Yes, here it leads into the undifferentiable, where none is equal or unequal, but all are one with one another. Do you see what approaches there?”</p>
<p>“I see something like a dark wall of clouds, swimming toward us on the tide.”</p>
<p>“Look more closely, what do you recognize?”</p>
<p>“I see densely pressed multitudes of men, old men, women, and children. Between them I see horses, oxen and smaller animals, a cloud of insects swarms around the multitude, a forest swims near, innumerable faded flowers, an utterly dead summer. They are already near; how stiff and cool they all look, their feet do not move, no noise sounds from their closed ranks. They are clasping themselves rigidly with their hands and arms; they are gazing beyond and pay us no heed—they are all flowing past in an enormous stream. Dark one, this vision is awful.”</p>
<p>“You wanted to stay by me, so get hold of yourself. Look!”</p>
<p>I see: “The first rows have reached the point where the surf and the stream flow together violently. And it looks as if a wave of air were confronting the stream of the dead together with the surging sea, whirling them up high, scattering them in black scraps, and dissolving them in murky clouds of mist. Wave after wave approaches, and ever new droves dissolve into black air. Dark one, tell me, is this the end?”</p>
<p>“Look!”</p>
<p>The dark sea breaks heavily—a reddish glow spreads out in it—it is like blood—a sea of blood foams at my feet—the depths of the sea glow—how strange I feel—am I suspended by my feet? Is it the sea or is it the sky? Blood and fire mix themselves together in a ball—red light erupts from its smoky shroud—a new sun escapes from the bloody sea, and rolls gleamingly toward the uttermost depths—it disappears under my feet.70</p>
<p>I look around me, I am all alone. Night has fallen. What did Ammonius say? Night is the time of silence.</p>
<p>[2] [HI 30] I looked around me and I saw that the solitude expanded into the immeasurable, and pierced me with horrible coldness. The sun still glowed in me, but I could feel myself stepping into the great shadow. I follow the stream that makes its way into the depths, slowly and unperturbed, into the depths of what is to come.</p>
<p>And thus I went out in that night (it was the second night of the year 1914), and anxious expectation filled me. I went out to embrace the future. The path was wide and what was to come was awful. It was the enormous dying, a sea of blood. From it the new sun arose, awful and a reversal of that which we call day. We have seized the darkness and its sun will shine above us, bloody and burning like a great downfall.</p>
<p>When I comprehended my darkness, a truly magnificent night came over me and my dream plunged me into the depths of the millennia, and from it my phoenix ascended.</p>
<p>But what happened to my day? Torches were kindled, bloody anger and disputes erupted. As darkness seized the world, the terrible war arose and the darkness destroyed the light of the world, since it was incomprehensible to the darkness and good for nothing anymore. And so we had to taste Hell.</p>
<p>I saw which vices the virtues of this time changed into, how your mildness became hard, your goodness became brutality, your love became hate, and your understanding became madness. Why did you want to comprehend the darkness! But you had to or else it would have seized you. Happy the man who anticipates this grasp.</p>
<p>Did you ever think of the evil in you? Oh, you spoke of it, you mentioned it, and you confessed it smilingly, as a generally human vice, or a recurring misunderstanding. But did you know 30/31 what evil is, and that it stands precisely right behind your virtues, that it is also your virtues themselves, as their inevitable substance?71 You locked Satan in the abyss for a millennium, and when the millennium had passed, you laughed at him, since he had become a children’s fairy tale.72 But if the dreadful great one raises his head, the world winces. The most extreme coldness draws near.</p>
<p>With horror you see that you are defenseless, and that the army of your vices falls powerless to its knees. With the power of daimons, you seize the evil, and your virtues cross over to him. You are completely alone in this struggle, since your Gods have become deaf. You do not know which devils are greater, your vices, or your virtues. But of one thing you are certain, that virtues and vices are brothers.</p>
<p>73We need the coldness of death to see clearly. Life wants to live and to die, to begin and to end.74 You are not forced to live eternally, but you can also die, since there is a will in you for both. Life and death must strike a balance in your existence.75 Today’s men need a large slice of death, since too much incorrectness lives in them, and too much correctness died in them. What stays in balance is correct, what disturbs balance is incorrect. But if balance has been attained, then that which preserves it is incorrect and that which disturbs it is correct. Balance is at once life and death. For the completion of life a balance with death is fitting. If I accept death, then my tree greens, since dying increases life. If I plunge into the death encompassing the world, then my buds break open. How much our life needs death!</p>
<p>Joy at the smallest things comes to you only when you have accepted death. But if you look out greedily for all that you could still live, then nothing is great enough for your pleasure, and the smallest things that continue to surround you are no longer a joy. Therefore I behold death, since it teaches me how to live.</p>
<p>If you accept death, it is altogether like a frosty night and an anxious misgiving, but a frosty night in a vineyard full of sweet grapes.76 You will soon take pleasure in your wealth. Death ripens. One needs death to be able to harvest the fruit. Without death, life would be meaningless, since the long-lasting rises again and denies its own meaning. To be, and to enjoy your being, you need death, and limitation enables you to fulfill your being.</p>
<p>[HI 31] When I see the lamentation and nonsense of the earth and consequently enter death with a covered head, then everything I see will indeed turn to ice. But in the shadow world the other rises, the red sun.77 It rises secretly and unexpectedly, and my world revolves like a satanic apparition. I suspect blood and murder. Blood and murder alone are still exalted, and have their own peculiar beauty; one can assume the beauty of bloody acts of violence.</p>
<p>But it is the unacceptable, the awfully repulsive, that which I have forever rejected that rises in me. For if the wretchedness and poverty of this life ends, another life begins in what is opposed to me. This is opposed to such an extent that I cannot conceive it. For it is opposed not according to the laws of reason, but thoroughly and according to its own nature. Yes, it is not only opposed, but repulsive, invisibly and cruelly repulsive, something that takes my breath away, that drains the power from my muscles, that confuses my senses, stings me poisonously from behind in the heel, and always strikes just where I did not suspect I possessed a vulnerable spot.78</p>
<p>It does not confront me like a strong enemy, manly and dangerously, but I perish on a dung heap, while peaceful chickens cackle around me, amazedly and mindlessly laying their eggs. A dog passes, lifts his leg over me, then trots off calmly. I curse the hour of my birth seven times, and if I do not choose to kill myself on the spot, I prepare to experience the hour of my second birth. The ancients said: <em>Inter faeces et urinas nascimur</em>.79 For three nights I was assaulted by the horrors of birth. On the third night, junglelike laughter pealed forth, for which nothing is too simple. Then life began to stir again. 31/32</p>
<p>The Remains of Earlier Temples80</p>
<p>Cap. vii.</p>
<p>[HI 32]81, 82Yet another new adventure occurred: wide meadows spread out before me—a carpet of flowers—soft hills—a fresh green wood in the distance. I come across two strange journeymen—probably two completely accidental companions: an old monk and a tall gangly thin man with a childish gait and discolored red clothes. As they draw near, I recognize the tall one as the red rider. How he has changed! He has grown old, his red hair has become gray, his fiery red clothes are worn out, shabby, poor. And the other? He has a paunch and appears not to have fallen on bad times. But his face seems familiar: by all the Gods, it’s Ammonius!</p>
<p>What changes! And where are these utterly different people coming from? I approach them and bid them good day. Both look at me frightened and make the sign of the cross. Their horror prompts me to look down at myself. I am fully covered in green leaves, which spring from my body. I greet them a second time, laughing.</p>
<p>Ammonius exclaims horrified: “Apage, Satanas!”83</p>
<p>The Red One: “Damned pagan riffraff!”</p>
<p>I: “But my dear friends, what’s wrong with you? I’m the Hyperborean stranger, who visited you, Oh Ammonius, in the desert.84 And I’m the watchman whom you, Red One, once visited.”</p>
<p>Ammonius: “I recognize you, you supreme devil. My downfall began with you.”</p>
<p>The Red One looks at him reproachfully and gives him a poke in the ribs. The monk sheepishly stops. The Red One turns haughtily toward me.</p>
<p>R: “Already at that time I couldn’t help thinking that you lacked a noble disposition, notwithstanding your hypocritical seriousness. Your damned Christian play-act—”</p>
<p>At this moment Ammonius pokes him in the ribs and the Red One falls into an embarrassed silence. And thus both stand before me, sheepish and ridiculous, and yet pitiable.</p>
<p>I: “Wherefrom, man of God? What outrageous fate has led you here, let alone in the company of the Red One?”</p>
<p>A: “I would prefer not to tell you. But it does not appear to be a dispensation of God that one can escape. So know then that you, evil spirit, have done me a terrible deed. You seduced me with 32/33 your accursed curiosity, desirously stretching my hand after the divine mysteries, since you made me conscious at that time that I really knew nothing about them. Your remark that I probably needed the closeness of men to arrive at the higher mysteries stunned me like infernal poison. Soon thereafter I called the brothers of the valley together and announced to them that a messenger of God had appeared to me—so terribly had you blinded me—and commanded me to form a monastery with the brothers.</p>
<p>“When Brother Philetus raised an objection, I refuted him with reference to the passage in the holy scriptures where it is said that it is not good for man to be alone.85 So we founded the monastery, near the Nile, from where we could see the passing ships.</p>
<p>“We cultivated fat fields, and there was so much to do that the holy scriptures fell into oblivion. We became voluptuous, and one day I was filled with such terrible longing to see Alexandria again. I talked myself into believing that I wanted to visit the bishop there. But first I was intoxicated so much by life on the ship, and then by the milling crowds on the streets of Alexandria, that I became completely lost.</p>
<p>“As in a dream I climbed onto a large ship bound for Italy. I felt an insatiable greed to see the world. I drank wine and saw that women were beautiful. I wallowed in pleasure and wholly turned into an animal. When I climbed ashore in Naples, the Red One stood there, and I knew that I had fallen into the hands of evil.”</p>
<p>R: “Be silent, old fool, if I had not been present, you would have become an outright pig. When you saw me, you finally pulled yourself together, cursed the drinking and the women, and returned to the monastery.</p>
<p>“Now hear my story, damned hobgoblin: I too fell into your snare, and your pagan arts also enticed me. After the conversation at that time, where you caught me in the fox trap with your remark about dancing, I became serious, so serious that I went into the monastery, prayed, fasted, and converted myself.</p>
<p>“In my blindness I wanted to reform the Church liturgy, and with the bishop’s approval I introduced dancing.</p>
<p>“I became Abbot and, as such, alone had the sole right to dance before the altar, like David before the ark of the covenant.86 But little by little, the brothers also began to dance; indeed, even the congregation of the faithful and finally the whole city danced.</p>
<p>“It was terrible. I fled into solitude and danced all day until I dropped, but in the morning the hellish dance began again.</p>
<p>“I sought to escape from myself, and strayed and wandered around at night. In the daytime I kept myself secluded, and danced alone in the forests and deserted mountains. And thus gradually I came to Italy. Down there in the south, I no longer felt as I had felt in the north; I could mingle with the crowds. Only in Naples did I somewhat find my way again, and there I also found this ragged man of God. His appearance gave me strength. Through him I could regain my health. You’ve heard how he took heart from me, too, and found his way again.”</p>
<p>A: “I must confess I did not fare so badly with the Red One; he’s a toned-down type of devil.”</p>
<p>R: “I must add that the monk is hardly the fanatical type, although I’ve developed a deep aversion against the whole Christian religion since my experience in the monastery.”</p>
<p>I: “Dear friends, it does my heart good to see you enjoying yourselves together.”</p>
<p>Both: “We are not pleased, mocker and adversary, clear off, you robber, pagan!”</p>
<p>I: “But why are you traveling together, if you’re not enjoying each other’s company and friendship?”</p>
<p>A: “What can be done? Even the devil is necessary, since otherwise one has nothing that commands a sense of respect with people.”</p>
<p>R: “Well, I need to come to an arrangement with the clergy, or else I will lose my clientele.”</p>
<p>I: “Therefore the necessities of life have brought you together! So let’s make peace and be friends.”</p>
<p>Both: “But we can never be friends.”</p>
<p>I: “Oh, I see, the system is at fault. You probably want to die out first? Now let me pass, you old ghosts!”</p>
<p>[2] [HI 33] When I had seen death and all the terrible solemnity that is gathered around it, and had become ice and night myself, an angry life and impulse rose up in me. My thirst for the rushing water of the deepest knowledge87 began to clink with wine glasses; from afar I heard drunken laughter, laughing women and street noise. Dance music, 33/34 stamping and cheering poured forth from all over; and instead of the rose-scented south wind, the reek of the human animal streamed over me. Luscious-lewd whores giggled and rustled along the walls, wine fumes and kitchen steam and the foolish cackling of the human crowd drew near in a cloud. Hot sticky tender hands reached out for me, and I was swaddled in the covers of a sickbed. I was born into life from below, and I grew up as heroes do, in hours rather than years. And after I had grown up, I found myself in the middle land, and saw that it was spring.</p>
<p>[HI 34] But I was no longer the man I had been, for a strange being grew through me. This was a laughing being of the forest, a leaf green daimon, a forest goblin and prankster, who lived alone in the forest and was itself a greening tree being, who loved nothing but greening and growing, who was neither disposed nor indisposed toward men, full of mood and chance, obeying an invisible law and greening and wilting with the trees, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither good nor bad, merely living, primordially old and yet completely young, naked and yet naturally clothed, not man but nature, frightened, laughable, powerful, childish, weak, deceiving and deceived, utterly inconstant and superficial, and yet reaching deep down, down to the kernel of the world.</p>
<p>I had absorbed the life of both of my friends; a green tree grew from the ruins of the temple. They had not withstood life, but, seduced by life, had become their own monkey business. They had got caught in the muck, and so they called the living a devil and traitor. Because both of them believed in themselves and in their own goodness, each in his own way, they ultimately became mired in the natural and conclusive burial ground of all outlived ideals. The most beautiful and the best, like the ugliest and the worst, end up someday in the most laughable place in the world, surrounded by fancy dress and led by fools, and go horror-struck to the pit of filth.</p>
<p><em>After the cursing comes laughter, so that the soul is saved from the dead.</em></p>
<p>Ideals are, according to their essence, desired and pondered; they exist to this extent, but only to this extent. Yet their effective being cannot be denied. He who believes he is really living his ideals, or believes he can live them, suffers from delusions of grandeur and behaves like a lunatic in that he stages himself as an ideal; but the hero has fallen. Ideals are mortal, so one should prepare oneself for their end: at the same time it probably costs you your neck. For do you not see that it was you who gave meaning, value, and effective force to your ideal? If you have become a sacrifice to the ideal, then the ideal cracks open, plays carnival with you, and goes to Hell on Ash Wednesday. The ideal is also a tool that one can put aside anytime, a torch on dark paths. But whoever runs around with a torch by day is a fool. How much my ideals have come down, and how freshly my tree greens!</p>
<p>88When I turned green, they stood there, the sad remains of earlier temples and rose gardens, and I recognized with a shudder their inner affinity. It seemed to me that they had established an indecent alliance. But I understood that this alliance had already existed for a long time. At a time when I still claimed that my sanctuaries were of crystal purity, and when I compared my friends to the perfume of the roses of Persia,89 both of them formed an alliance of mutual silence. They seemed to scatter, but secretly they worked together. The solitary silence of the temple lured me far away from men to the supernatural mysteries in which I lost myself to the point of surfeit. And while I struggled with God, the devil prepared himself for my reception, and tore me just as far to his side. There, too, I found no boundaries other than surfeit and disgust. I did not live, but was driven; I was a slave to my ideals.90</p>
<p>And thus they stood there, the ruins, quarreling with one another and unable to reconcile themselves to their common misery. Within myself I had become one as a natural being, but I was a hobgoblin91 who frightened the solitary wanderer, and who avoided the places of men. But I greened and bloomed from within myself. I had still not become a man again who carried within himself the conflict between a longing for the world and a longing for the spirit. I did not live either of these longings, but I lived myself, and was a merrily greening tree in a remote spring forest. And thus I learned to live without the world and spirit; and I was amazed how well I could live like this.</p>
<p>But what about men, what about mankind? There they stood, the two deserted bridges that should lead across to mankind: one leads from above to below, and men glide down on it, which pleases them. 34/35 The other leads from below to above and mankind groans upward on it. This causes them trouble. We drive our fellow men to trouble and joy. If I myself do not live, but merely climb, it gives others undeserved pleasure. If I simply enjoy myself, it causes others undeserved trouble. If I merely live, I am far removed from men. They no longer see me, and when they see me, they are astonished and shocked. I myself, however, quite simply living, greening, blooming, fading, stand like a tree always in the same spot and let the suffering and the joy of men pass over me with equanimity. And yet I am a man who cannot excuse himself from the discord of the human heart.</p>
<p>But my ideals can also be my dogs, whose yapping and squabbling do not disturb me. But at least then I am a good and a bad dog to men. But I have not yet achieved what should be, namely that I live and yet am a man. It seems to be nearly impossible to live as a man. As long as you are not conscious of your self you can live; but if you become conscious of your self, you fall from one grave into another. All your92 rebirths could ultimately make you93 sick. The Buddha therefore finally gave up on rebirth, for he had had enough of crawling through all human and animal forms.94 After all the rebirths you still remain the lion crawling on the earth, the ΧΑΜΑΙΛΕΩΝ [Chameleon], a caricature, one prone to changing colors, a crawling shimmering lizard, but precisely not a lion, whose nature is related to the sun, who draws his power from within himself, who does not crawl around in the protective colors of the environment, and who does not defend himself by going into hiding. I recognized the chameleon and no longer want to crawl on the earth and change colors and be reborn; instead I want to exist from my own force, like the sun which gives light and does not suck light. That belongs to the earth. I recall my solar nature and would like to rush to my rising. But ruins95 stand in my way. They say: “With regard to men you should be this or that.” My chameleonesque skin shudders. They obtrude upon me and want to color me. But that should no longer be. Neither good nor evil shall be my masters. I push them aside, the laughable survivors, and go on my way again, which leads me to the East. The quarreling powers that for so long stood between me and myself lie behind me.</p>
<p>Henceforth I am completely alone. I can no longer say to you: “Listen!” or “you should,” or “you could,” but now I talk only with myself. Now no one else can do anything more for me, nothing whatsoever. I no longer have a duty toward you, and you no longer have duties toward me, since I vanish and you vanish from me. I no longer hear requests and no longer make requests of you. I no longer fight and reconcile myself with you, but place silence between you and me.</p>
<p>Your call dies away in the distance, and you cannot find my footprints. Together with the west wind, which comes from the plains of the ocean, I journey across the green countryside, I roam through the forests, and bend the young grass. I talk with trees and the forest wildlife, and the stones show me the way. When I thirst and the source does not come to me, I go to the source. When I starve and the bread does not come to me, I seek my bread and take it where I find it. I provide no help and need no help. If at any time necessity confronts me, I do not look around to see whether there is a helper nearby, but I accept the necessity and bend and writhe and struggle. I laugh, I weep, I swear, but I do not look around me.</p>
<p>On this way, no one walks behind me, and I cross no one’s path. I am alone, but I fill my solitariness with my life. I am man enough, I am noise, conversation, comfort, and help enough unto myself. And so I wander to the far East. Not that I know anything about what my distant goal might be. I see blue horizons before me: they suffice as a goal. I hurry toward the East and my rising—I will my rising. 35/37 [Image 36]96 36/37</p>
<p>First Day</p>
<p>Cap. viii.97</p>
<p>[HI 37] But on the third night,98 a desolate mountain range blocks my way, though a narrow valley gorge allows me to enter. The way leads inevitably between two high rock faces. My feet are bare and injure themselves on the jagged rocks. Here the path becomes slippery. One-half of the way is white, the other black. I step onto the black side and recoil horrified: it is hot iron. I step onto the white half: it is ice. But so it must be. I dart across and onward, and finally the valley widens into a mighty rocky basin. A narrow path winds up along vertical rocks to the mountain ridge at the top.</p>
<p>As I approach the top, a mighty booming resounds from the other side of the mountain like ore being pounded. The sound gradually swells, and echoes thunderously in the mountain. As I reach the pass, I see an enormous man approach from the other side.</p>
<p>Two bull horns rise from his great head, and a rattling suit of armor covers his chest. His black beard is ruffled and decked with exquisite stones. The giant is carrying a sparkling double axe in his hand, like those used to strike bulls. Before I can recover from my amazed fright, the giant is standing before me. I look at his face: it is faint and pale and deeply wrinkled. His almond-shaped eyes look at me astonished. Horror takes hold of me: this is Izdubar, the mighty, the bull-man. He stands and looks at me: his face speaks of consuming inner fear, and his hands and knees tremble. Izdubar, the powerful bull trembling? Is he frightened? I call out to him:</p>
<p>“Oh, Izdubar, most powerful, spare my life and forgive me for lying like a worm in your path.”</p>
<p>Iz: “I do not want your life. Where do you come from?”</p>
<p>I: “I come from the West.”</p>
<p>Iz: “You come from the West? Do you know of the Western lands? Is this the right way to the Western lands?”99</p>
<p>I: “I come from a Western land, whose coast washes against the great Western sea.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Does the sun sink in that sea? Or does it touch the solid land in its decline?”</p>
<p>I: “The sun sinks far beyond the sea.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Beyond the sea? What lies there?”</p>
<p>I: “There is nothing but empty space there. As you know, the earth is round and moreover it turns around the sun.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Damned one, where do you get such knowledge? So there is no immortal land where the sun goes down to be reborn? Are you speaking the truth?”</p>
<p>His eyes flicker with fury and fear. He steps a thundering pace closer. I tremble.</p>
<p>I: “Oh, Izdubar, most powerful one, forgive my presumptuousness, but I’m really speaking the truth. I come from a land where this is proven science and where people live who travel round the world with their ships. Our scholars know through measurement how far the sun is from each point of the surface of the earth. It is a celestial body that lies unspeakably far out in unending space.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Unending—did you say? Is the space of the world unending, and we can never reach the sun?”</p>
<p>I: “Most powerful one, insofar as you are mortal, you can never reach the sun.”</p>
<p>I see him overcome with suffocating fear.</p>
<p>Iz: “I am mortal—and I shall never reach the sun, and never reach immortality?”</p>
<p>He smashes his axe with a powerful, clanging blow on the rock.</p>
<p>Iz: “Be gone, miserable weapon. You are not much use. How should you be of use against infinity, against the eternal void, 37/38 and against the unreplenishible? There is no one left for you to conquer. Smash yourself, what’s it worth!”</p>
<p>(In the West the sun sinks into the lap of glowing clouds in bright crimson.)</p>
<p>“So go away, sun, thrice-damned God, and wrap yourself in your immortality!”</p>
<p>(He snatches the smashed piece of his axe from the ground and hurls it toward the sun.)</p>
<p>“Here you have your sacrifice, your last sacrifice!”</p>
<p>He collapses and sobs like a child. I stand shaking and hardly dare stir.</p>
<p>Iz: “Miserable worm, where did you suckle on this poison?”</p>
<p>I: “Oh Izdubar, most powerful one, what you call poison is science. In our country we are nurtured on it from youth, and that may be one reason why we haven’t properly flourished and remain so dwarfish. When I see you, however, it seems to me as if we are all somewhat poisoned.”100</p>
<p>Iz: “No stronger being has ever cut me down, no monster has ever resisted my strength. But your poison, worm, which you have placed in my way has lamed me to the marrow. Your magical poison is stronger than the army of Tiamat.”101 (He lies as if paralyzed, stretched out on the ground.) “You Gods, help, here lies your son, cut down by the invisible serpent’s bite in his heel. Oh, if only I had crushed you when I saw you, and never heard your words.”</p>
<p>I: “Oh Izdubar, great and pitiable one, had I known that my knowledge could cut you down, I would have held my tongue. But I wanted to speak the truth.”</p>
<p>Iz: “You call poison truth? Is poison truth? Or is truth poison? Do not our astrologers and priests also speak the truth? And yet theirs does not act like poison.”</p>
<p>I: “Oh Izdubar, night is falling, and it will get cold up here. Shall I not fetch you help from men?”</p>
<p>Iz: “Let it be, and answer me instead.”</p>
<p>I: “But we cannot philosophize here, of all places. Your wretched condition demands help.”</p>
<p>Iz: “I say to you, let it be. If I should perish this night, so be it. Just give me an answer.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m afraid, my words are weak, if they are to heal.”</p>
<p>Iz: “They cannot bring about something more grave. The disaster has already happened. So tell me what you know. Perhaps you even have a magic word that counteracts the poison.”</p>
<p>I: “My words, Oh most powerful one, are poor and have no magical power.”</p>
<p>Iz: “No matter, speak!”</p>
<p>I: “I don’t doubt that your priests speak the truth. It is certainly a truth, only it runs contrary to our truth.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Are there then two sorts of truth?”</p>
<p>I: “It seems to me to be so. Our truth is that which comes to us from the knowledge of outer things. The truth of your priests is that which comes to you from inner things.”</p>
<p>Iz (half sitting up): “That was a salutary word.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m fortunate that my weak words have relieved you. Oh, if only I knew many more words that could help you. It has now grown cold and dark. I’ll make a fire to warm us.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Do that, as it might help.” (I gathered wood and lit a big fire.) “The holy fire warms me. Now tell me, how did you make a fire so swiftly and mysteriously?”</p>
<p>I: “All I need are matches. Look, they are small pieces of wood with a special substance at the tip. Rubbing them against the box produces fire.”</p>
<p>Iz: “That is astonishing, where did you learn this art?”</p>
<p>I: “Everyone has matches where I come from. But this is the least of it. We can also fly with the help of useful machines.” 38/39</p>
<p>Iz: “You can fly like birds? If your words did not contain such powerful magic, I would say to you, you were lying.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m certainly not lying. Look, I also have a timepiece, for example, which shows the exact time of day.”</p>
<p>Iz: “This is wonderful. It is clear that you come from a strange and marvelous land. You certainly come from the blessed Western lands. Are you immortal?”</p>
<p>I: “I—immortal? There is nothing more mortal than we are.”</p>
<p>Iz: “What? You are not even immortal and yet you understand such arts?”</p>
<p>I: “Unfortunately our science has still not yet succeeded in finding a method against death.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Who then taught you such arts?”</p>
<p>I: “In the course of the centuries men have made many discoveries, through precise observation and the science of outer things.”</p>
<p>Iz: “But this science is the awful magic that has lamed me. How can it be that you are still alive even though you drink from this poison every day?”</p>
<p>I: “We’ve grown accustomed to this over time, because men get used to everything. But we’re still somewhat lamed. On the other hand, this science also has great advantages, as you’ve seen. What we’ve lost in terms of force, we’ve rediscovered many times through mastering the force of nature.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Isn’t it pathetic to be so wounded? For my part, I draw my own force from the force of nature. I leave the secret force to the cowardly conjurers and womanly magicians. If I crush another’s skull to pulp, that will stop his awful magic.”</p>
<p>I: “But don’t you realize how the touch of our magic has worked upon you? Terribly, I think.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Unfortunately, you are right.”</p>
<p>I: “Now you perhaps see that we had no choice. We had to swallow the poison of science. Otherwise we would have met the same fate as you have: we’d be completely lamed, if we encountered it unsuspecting and unprepared. This poison is so insurmountably strong that everyone, even the strongest, and even the eternal Gods, perish because of it. If our life is dear to us, we prefer to sacrifice a piece of our life force rather than abandon ourselves to certain death.”</p>
<p>Iz: “I no longer think that you come from the blessed Western lands. Your country must be desolate, full of paralysis and renunciation. I yearn for the East, where the pure source of our life-giving wisdom flows.”</p>
<p>We sit silently at the flickering fire. The night is cold. Izdubar groans and looks up at the starry sky above.</p>
<p>Iz: “Most terrible day of my life—unending—so long—so long—wretched magical art—our priests know nothing, or else they could have protected me from it—even the Gods die, he says. Have you no Gods anymore?”</p>
<p>I: “No, words are all we have.”</p>
<p>Iz: “But are these words powerful?”</p>
<p>I: “So they claim, but one notices nothing of this.”</p>
<p>Iz: “We do not see the Gods either and yet we believe that they exist. We recognize their workings in natural events.”</p>
<p>I: “Science has taken from us the capacity of belief.”102</p>
<p>Iz: “What, you have lost that, too? How then do you live?”</p>
<p>I: “We live thus, with one foot in the cold and one foot in the hot, and for the rest, come what may!”</p>
<p>Iz: “You express yourself darkly.”</p>
<p>I: “So it also is with us, it is dark.”</p>
<p>Iz: “Can you bear it?”</p>
<p>I: “Not particularly well. I personally don’t find myself at ease with it. For that reason, I’ve set out to the East, to the land of the rising sun, to seek the light that we lack. Where then does the sun rise?”</p>
<p>Iz: “The earth is, as you say, completely round. Thus the sun rises nowhere.”</p>
<p>I: “I mean, do you have the light that we lack?” 39/40</p>
<p>Iz: “Look at me: I flourish in the light of the Eastern world. From this you can measure how fruitful this light is. But if you come from such a dark land, then beware of such an overpowering light. You could go blind just as we all are somewhat blind.”</p>
<p>I: “If your light is as fantastic as you are, then I will be careful.”</p>
<p>Iz: “You do well by this.”</p>
<p>I: “I long for your truth.”</p>
<p>Iz: “As I long for the Western lands. I warn you.”</p>
<p>Silence descends. It is late at night. We fall asleep next to the fire.</p>
<p>[2] [HI 40] I wandered toward the South and found the unbearable heat of solitude with myself. I wandered toward the North and found the cold death from which all the world dies. I withdrew to my Western land, where the men are rich in knowing and doing, and I began to suffer from the sun’s empty darkness. And I threw everything from me and wandered toward the East, where the light rises daily. I went to the East like a child. I did not ask, I simply waited.</p>
<p>Cheerful flowery meadows and lovely spring forests hemmed my path. But in the third night, the heaviness came. It stood before me like a range of cliffs full of sorrowful desolation, and everything tried to deter me from following my life’s path. But I found the entrance and the narrow way. The torment was great, since it was not for nothing that I had pushed the two dissipated and dissolute ones away from me. I unsuspectingly absorb what I reject. What I accept enters that part of my soul which I do not know; I accept what I do to myself, but I reject what is done to me.</p>
<p>So the path of my life led me beyond the rejected opposites, united in smooth and—alas!—extremely painful sides of the way which lay before me. I stepped on them but they burned and froze my soles. And thus I reached the other side. But the poison of the serpent, whose head you crush, enters you through the wound in your heel; and thus the serpent becomes more dangerous than it was before. Since whatever I reject is nevertheless in my nature. I thought it was without, and so I believed that I could destroy it. But it resides in me and has only assumed a passing outer form and stepped toward me. I destroyed its form and believed that I was a conqueror. But I have not yet overcome myself.</p>
<p>The outer opposition is an image of my inner opposition. Once I realize this, I remain silent and think of the chasm of antagonism in my soul. Outer oppositions are easy to overcome. They indeed exist, but nevertheless you can be united with yourself. They will indeed burn and freeze your soles, but only your soles. It hurts, but you continue and look toward distant goals.</p>
<p>As I rose to the highest point and my hope wanted to look out toward the East, a miracle happened: as I moved toward the East, one from the East hurried toward me and strove toward the sinking light. I wanted light, he wanted night. I wanted to rise, he wanted to sink. I was dwarfish like a child, while he was enormous like an elementally powerful hero. Knowledge lamed me, while he was blinded by the fullness of the light. And so we hurried toward each other; he, from the light; I, from the darkness; he, strong; I, weak; he, God; I, serpent; he, ancient; I, utterly new; he, unknowing; I, knowing; he, fantastic; I, sober; he, brave, powerful; I, cowardly, cunning. But we were both astonished to see one another on the border between morning and evening.</p>
<p>I was a child and grew like a greening tree and let the wind and distant cries and commotion of opposites 40/41 blow calmly through my branches, I was a boy and mocked fallen heroes, I was a youth pushing aside their clutching grips left and right, and so I did not anticipate the Powerful, Blind, and Immortal One, who wandered longingly after the sinking sun, who wanted to cleave the ocean down to its bottom so he could descend into the source of life. That which hurries toward the rising is small, that which approaches the descent is great. Hence I was small, since I simply came from the depths of my descent. I had been where he yearned to be. He who descends is great, and it would be easy for him to smash me. A God who looks like the sun does not hunt worms. But the worm aims at the heel of the Powerful One and will prepare him for the descent that he needs. His power is great and blind. He is marvelous to look at and frightening. But the serpent finds its spot. A little poison and the great one falls. The words of the one who rises have no sound and taste bitter. It is not a sweet poison, but one that is fatal for all Gods.</p>
<p><em>Alas, he is my dearest, most beautiful friend, he who rushes across, pursuing the sun and wanting to marry himself with the immeasurable mother as the sun does. How closely akin, indeed how completely one are the serpent and the God! The word which was our deliverer has become a deadly weapon, a serpent that secretly stabs.</em></p>
<p>No longer do outer opposites stand in my way, but my own opposite comes toward me, and rises up hugely before me, and we block each other’s way. The word of the serpent certainly defeats the danger, but my way remains barred, since I then had to fall from paralysis into blindness, just as the Powerful One fell into paralysis to escape his blindness. I cannot reach the blinding power of the sun, just as he, the Powerful One, cannot reach the ever-fruitful womb of darkness. I seem to be denied power, while he is denied rebirth, but I escape the blindness that comes with power and he escapes the nothingness that comes with death. My hope for the fullness of the light shatters, just as his longing for boundless conquered life shatters. I had felled the strongest, and the God climbs down to mortality.</p>
<p>[OB 41] *The Mighty One fell, he lies on the ground.*103</p>
<p><em>Power must subside for the sake of life.</em></p>
<p><em>The circumference of outer life should be made smaller.</em></p>
<p><em>Much more secrecy, solitary fires, fire, caverns, dark wide forests, sparsely peopled settlements, quietly flowing streams, silent winter and summer nights, small ships and carriages, and secure in dwellings the rare and precious.</em></p>
<p><em>From afar wanderers walk along solitary roads, looking here and there.</em></p>
<p><em>Hurrying becomes impossible, patience grows.</em> 41/42</p>
<p>[OB 42] <em>The noise of the days of the world falls silent, and the warming fire blazes inside.</em></p>
<p><em>Sitting at the fire, the shades of those gone before wail softly and give news of the past.</em></p>
<p><em>Come to the solitary fire, you blind and lame ones and hear of both kinds of truth: the blind will be lamed and the lamed will be blinded, yet the shared fire warms both in the lengthening night.</em></p>
<p><em>An old secret fire burns between us, giving sparse light and ample warmth.</em></p>
<p><em>The primordial fire that conquers every necessity shall burn again, since the night of the world is wide and cold, and the need is great.</em></p>
<p><em>The well-protected fire brings together those from far away and those who are cold, those who do not see one another and cannot reach one another, and it conquers suffering and shatters need.</em></p>
<p><em>The words uttered at the fire are ambiguous and deep and show life the right way.</em></p>
<p><em>The blind shall be lamed, so that he will not run into the abyss, and the lamed shall be blind, so that he will not look at things beyond his reach with longing and contempt.</em></p>
<p><em>Both may be aware of their deep helplessness so that they will respect the holy fire again, as well as the shades sitting at the hearth, and the words that encircle the flames.</em></p>
<p>The ancients called the saving word the Logos, an expression of divine reason.104 So much unreason 42/43 was in man that he needed reason to be saved. If one waits long enough, one sees how the Gods all change into serpents and underworld dragons in the end. This is also the fate of the Logos: in the end it poisons us all. In time, we were all poisoned, but unknowingly we kept the One, the Powerful One, the eternal wanderer in us away from the poison. We spread poison and paralysis around us in that we want to educate all the world around us into reason.</p>
<p>Some have their reason in thinking, others in feeling. Both are servants of Logos, and in secret become worshipers of the serpent.105</p>
<p>You can subjugate yourself, shackle yourself in irons, whip yourself bloody every day: you have crushed yourself, but not overcome yourself. Precisely through this you have helped the Powerful One, strengthened your paralysis, and promoted his blindness. He would like to see it in others, and inflict it on them, and would like to force the Logos on you and others, longingly and tyrannically with blind obstinacy and vacant stubborness. Give him a taste of Logos. He is afraid, and he already trembles from afar since he suspects that he has become outdated, and that a tiny droplet of the poison of Logos will paralyze him. But because he is your beautiful, much loved brother, you will act slavishly toward him and you would like to spare him as you have spared none of your fellow men. You spared no merry and no powerful means to strike your fellow men with the poisoned arrow. Paralyzed game is an unworthy prey. The powerful huntsman, who wrestles the bull to the ground and tears the lion to pieces and strikes the army of Tiamat, is your bow’s worthy target.106</p>
<p>If you live as he whom you are, He will come running against you impetuously, and you can hardly miss him. He will lay violent hands on you and force you into slavery if you do not remember your terrible weapon, which you have always used in his service against yourself. You will be cunning, terrible, and cold if you make the beautiful and much loved fall. But you should not kill him, even if he suffers and writhes in unbearable agony. Bind the holy Sebastian to a tree and slowly and rationally shoot arrow after arrow into his twitching flesh.107 When you do so, remind yourself that each arrow that strikes him spares one of your dwarfish and lame brothers. So you may shoot many arrows. But there is a misunderstanding that occurs all too frequently and is almost ineradicable: Men always want to destroy the beautiful and much loved outside of themselves, but never within themselves.</p>
<p>He, the beautiful and most loved one, came to me from the East, from just that place which I was seeking to reach. Admiringly I saw his power and magnificence, and I recognized that he was striving for precisely what I had abandoned, namely my dark human milling crowd of abjection. I recognized the blindness and unknowingness of his striving which worked against my desire, and I opened his eyes and lamed his powerful limbs with a poisoned stab. And he lay crying like a child, as that which he was, a child, a primordial grown child that required human Logos. So he lay before me, helpless, my blind God, who had become half-seeing and paralyzed. And compassion seized me, since it was plain to me that I should not let him die, he who approached me from the rising, from that place where he could be well, but which I could never reach. He whom I sought I now possessed. The East could give me nothing other than him, the sick and fallen one.</p>
<p>You need to undertake only half of the way, he will undertake the other half. If you go beyond him, blindness will befall you. If he goes beyond you, paralysis will befall him. Therefore, and insofar as it is the manner of the Gods to go beyond mortals, they become paralyzed, and become as helpless as children. Divinity and humanity should remain preserved, if man should remain before the God, and the God remain before man. The high-blazing flame is the middle way, whose luminous course runs between the human and the divine.</p>
<p>The divine primordial power is blind, since its face has become human. The human is the face of the Godhead. If the God comes near you, then plead for your life to be spared, since the God is loving horror. The ancients said: it is terrible to fall into the hands of the living God.108 They spoke thus because they knew, since they were still close to the ancient forest, and they turned green like the trees in a childlike manner and ascended far away toward the East. 43/44</p>
<p>Consequently they fell into the hands of the living God. They learned to kneel and to lie with their faces down, to beg for pity, and they learned to live in servile fear and to be grateful. But he who saw him, the terrible beautiful one with his black velvet eyes and the long eyelashes, the eyes that do not see but merely gaze lovingly and fearfully, he has learned to cry out and whimper, so that he can at least reach the ear of the Godhead. Only your fearful cry can stop the God. And then you see that the God also trembles, since he stands confronting his face, his observing gaze in you, and he feels unknown power. The God is afraid of man.</p>
<p>If my God is lamed, I must stand by him, since I cannot abandon the much-loved. I sense that he is my lot, my brother, who abided and grew in the light while I was in the darkness and fed myself with poison. It is good to know such things: if we are surrounded by night, our brother stands in the fullness of the light, doing his great deeds, tearing up the lion and killing the dragon. And he draws his bow against ever more distant goals, until he becomes aware of the sun wandering high up in the sky and wants to catch it. But when he has discovered his valuable prey, then your longing for the light also awakens. You discard the fetters and take yourself to the place of the rising light. And thus you rush toward each other. He believed he could simply capture the sun and encountered the worm of the shadows. You thought that in the East you could drink from the source of the light, and catch the horned giant, before whom you fall to your knees. His essence is blind excessive longing and tempestuous force. My essence is seeing limitation and the incapacity of cleverness. He possesses in abundance what I lack. Consequently I will also not let him go, the Bull God, who once wounded Jacob’s hip and whom I have now lamed.109 I want to make his force my own.</p>
<p>It is therefore prudent to keep alive the severely afflicted so that his force continues to support me. We miss nothing more than divine force. We say, “Yes, indeed, this is how it should or could be. This or that should be achieved.” We speak thus and stand thus, and look about us embarrassed, to see whether somehow something will occur. And should something happen, we look on and say: “Yes, indeed, we understand, it is this or that, or it is similar to this or that.” And thus we speak and stand and look around to see whether somewhere something might happen. Something always happens, but we do not happen, since our God is sick. We have seen him dead with the venomous gaze of the Basilisk on his face, and we have understood that he is dead. We must think of his healing. And yet again I feel it quite clearly that my life would have broken in half had I failed to heal my God. Hence I abided with him in the long cold night.

<p>Second Day</p>
<p>Cap. ix.</p>
<p>[HI 46] No dream gave me the saving word.111 Izdubar lay silent and stiff all night, until daybreak.112 I paced the mountain ridge, pondering, and looked back to my Western lands, where there is so much knowledge and so much possibility of help. I love Izdubar, and I do not want him to wither away miserably. But where should help come from? No one will travel the hot-cold path. And I? I am afraid to return to that path. And in the East? Was there possibly help there? But what about the unknown dangers that loomed there? I do not want to go blind. What use would that be to Izdubar? I cannot carry this lamed one as a blind man either. Yes, if I were powerful like Izdubar. What use is science here?</p>
<p>Toward evening I went up to Izdubar and spoke to him: “Izdubar, my prince, listen! I will not let you decline. The second evening is falling. We have no food and we are bound to die if I cannot find help. We cannot expect any help from the West, but help is possible from the East. Did you meet anyone on your way whom we could call on for help?”</p>
<p>Iz: “Let it be, may death come when it will.”</p>
<p>I: “My heart bleeds at the thought of leaving you here without having done the upmost to help you.”</p>
<p>Iz: “What help is your magical power to you? If you were strong, as I am, you could carry me. But your poison can only destroy and not help.”</p>
<p>I: “If we were in my land, swift wagons could bring us help.”</p>
<p>Iz: “If we were in my land, your poisoned barb would not have reached me.”</p>
<p>I: “Tell me, do you know of no help from the side of the East?”</p>
<p>Iz: “The way there is long and lonely, and when you reach the plains after crossing the mountains, you will meet the powerful sun which will blind you.”</p>
<p>I: “But what if I wandered by night and if I sheltered from the sun during the day?”</p>
<p>Iz: “In the night all the serpents and dragons crawl out of their holes and you, unarmed, will inevitably fall victim to them. Let it be! How would this help? My legs have withered and are numb. I prefer not to bring home the booty of this journey.”</p>
<p>I: “Should I not risk everything?”</p>
<p>Iz: “Useless! Nothing is gained if you die.”</p>
<p>I: “Let me think it over a bit, perhaps a saving thought will yet come to me.”</p>
<p>I withdraw and sit down on a rock high above on the ridge of the mountain. And this speech began in me: Great Izdubar, you are in a hopeless position—and I no less.113 What can be done? It is not always necessary to act; sometimes thinking is better. I am basically convinced that Izdubar is hardly real in the ordinary sense, but is a fantasy. It would help if the situation were considered from another angle. . . considered. . . considered. . . it is remarkable that even here thoughts echo; one must be quite alone. But this will hardly last. He will of course not accept that he is a fantasy, but instead claim that he is completely real and that he can only be helped in a real way: nevertheless, it would be worth trying this means once. I will appeal to him:</p>
<p>I: “My prince, Powerful One, listen: a thought came to me that might save us. I think that you are not at all real, but only a fantasy.”</p>
<p>Iz: “I am terrified by this thought. It is murderous. Do you even mean to declare me unreal 46/47 —now that you have lamed me so pitifully?”</p>
<p>I: “Perhaps I have not made myself clear enough, and have spoken too much in the language of the Western lands. I do not mean to say that you are not real at all, of course, but only as real as a fantasy. If you could accept this, much would be gained.”</p>
<p>Iz: “What would be gained by this? You are a tormenting devil.”</p>
<p>I: “Pitiful one, I will not torment you. The hand of the doctor does not seek to torment even if it causes grief. Can you really not accept that you are a fantasy?”</p>
<p>Iz: “Woe betide me! In what magic do you want to entangle me? Should it help me if I take myself for a fantasy?”</p>
<p>I: “You know that the name one bears means a lot. You also know that one often gives the sick new names to heal them, for with the new name, they come by a new essence. Your name is your essence.”</p>
<p>Iz: “You are right, our priests also say this.”</p>
<p>I: “So are you prepared to admit that you are a fantasy?”</p>
<p>Iz: “If it helps—yes.”</p>
<p>The inner voice now spoke to me as follows: while admittedly he is a fantasy now, the situation remains extremely complex. A fantasy cannot be simply negated and treated with resignation either. It calls for action. Anyway, he is a fantasy—and thus considerably more volatile—I think I can see a way forward: I can take him on my back for now. I went to Izdubar and said to him:</p>
<p>“A way has been found. You have become light, lighter than a feather. Now I can carry you.” I put my arms round him and lift him up from the ground; he is lighter than air, and I struggle to keep my feet on the ground since my load lifts me up into the air.</p>
<p>Iz: “That was a masterstroke. Where are you carrying me?”</p>
<p>I: “I am going to carry you down into the Western land. My comrades will happily accommodate such a large fantasy. Once we have crossed the mountains and have reached the houses of hospitable men, I can calmly go about finding a means to restore you completely again.”</p>
<p>Carrying him on my back, I climb down the small rock path with great care, more in danger of being whirled aloft by the wind than of losing balance because of my load and plunging down the mountainside. I hang on to my all too lightweight load. finally we reach the bottom of the valley and the way of the hot and cold pain. But this time I am blown by a whistling East wind down through the narrow rocks and across the fields toward inhabited places, making no contact with the painful way. Spurred on, I hasten through beautiful lands. I see two people ahead of me: Ammonius and the Red One. When we are right behind them, they turn round and run off into the fields with horrified cries. I must have proved a strange sight indeed.</p>
<p>Iz: “Who are these misshapen ones? Are these your comrades?”</p>
<p>I: “These are not men, they are so-called relics of the past which one still often encounters in the Western lands. They used to be very important. They’re now used mostly as shepherds.”</p>
<p>Iz: “What a wondrous country! But look, isn’t that a town? Don’t you want to go there?”</p>
<p>I: “No, God forbid. I don’t want a crowd to gather, since the enlightened live there. Can’t you smell them? They’re actually dangerous, since they cook the strongest poisons from which even I must protect myself. The people there are totally paralyzed, wrapped in a brown poisonous vapor and can only move with artificial means. 47/48 But you need not worry. Night has almost fallen and no one will see us. Moreover, no one would admit to having seen me. I know an out of the way house here. I have close friends there who will take us in for the night.”</p>
<p>Izdubar and I come to a quiet dark garden and a secluded house. I hide Izdubar under the drooping branches of a tree, go up to the door of the house, and knock. I ponder the door: it is much too small. I will never be able to get Izdubar through it. Yet—a fantasy takes up no space! Why did this excellent thought not occur to me earlier? I return to the garden and with no difficulty squeeze Izdubar into the size of an egg and put him in my pocket. Then I walk into the welcoming house where Izdubar should find healing.</p>
<p>[2][HI 48]114 Thus my God found salvation. He was saved precisely by what one would actually consider fatal, namely by declaring him a figment of the imagination. How often has it been assumed that the Gods have been brought to their end in this way.115 This was obviously a serious mistake, since this was precisely what saved the God. He did not pass away, but became a living fantasy, whose workings I could feel on my own body: my inherent heaviness faded and the hot and cold way of pain no longer burned and froze my soles. The weight no longer kept me pressed to the ground, but instead the wind carried me lightly like a feather, while I carried the giant.116</p>
<p>One used to believe that one could murder a God. But the God was saved, he forged a new axe in the fire, and plunged again into the flood of light of the East to resume his ancient cycle.117 But we clever men crept around lamed and poisoned, and did not even know that we lacked something. But I loved my God, and took him to the house of men, since I was convinced that he also really lived as a fantasy, and should therefore not be left behind, wounded and sick. And hence I experienced the miracle of my body losing its heaviness when I burdened myself with the God.</p>
<p>St. Christopher, the giant, bore his burden with difficulty, despite the fact that he bore only the Christ child.118 But I was as small as a child and bore a giant, and yet my burden lifted me up. The Christ child became an easy burden for the giant Christopher, since Christ himself said, “My yoke is sweet, and my burden is light.”119 We should not bear Christ as he is unbearable, but we should be Christs, for then our yoke is sweet and our burden easy. This tangible and apparent world is one reality, but fantasy is the other reality. So long as we leave the God outside us apparent and tangible, he is unbearable and hopeless. But if we turn the God into fantasy, he is in us and is easy to bear. The God outside us increases the weight of everything heavy, while the God within us lightens everything heavy. Hence all Christophers have stooped backs and short breath, since the world is heavy.</p>
<p>[HI 48/2] Many have wanted to get help for their sick God and were then devoured by the serpents and dragons lurking on the way to the land of the sun. They perished in the overbright day and have become dark men, since their eyes have been blinded. Now they go around like shadows and speak of the light but see little. But their God is in everything that they do not see: He is in the dark Western lands and he sharpens seeing eyes and he assists those cooking the poison and he guides serpents to the heels of the blind perpetrators. Therefore, if you are clever, take the God with you, then you know where he is. If you do not have him with you in the Western lands, he will come running to you at night with clanking armor and a crushing battle axe.120 If you do not have him with you in the land of the dawn, then you will step unawares on the divine worm who awaits your unsuspecting heel. 48/49</p>
<p>[HI 49] You gain everything from the God whom you bear, but not his weapon, since he crushed it. He who conquers needs weapons. But what else do you want to conquer? You cannot conquer more than the earth. And what is the earth? It is round all over and hangs like a drop in the cosmos. You will not reach the sun, and your power will not even extend to the barren moon; you will conquer neither the sea, nor the snow on the poles, nor the sands of the desert, but only a few spots on the green earth. You will not conquer anything for any length of time. Your power will turn into dust tomorrow, for above all—at the very least—you must conquer death. So do not be a fool, throw down your weapon. God himself smashed his weapon. Armor is enough to protect you from fools who still suffer from the need to conquer. God’s armor will make you invulnerable and invisible to the worst fools.</p>
<p>Take your God with you. Bear him down to your dark land where people live who rub their eyes each morning and yet always see only the same thing and never anything else. Bring your God down to the haze pregnant with poison, but not like those blinded ones who try to illuminate the darkness with lanterns which it does not comprehend. Instead, secretly carry your God to a hospitable roof. The huts of men are small and they cannot welcome the God despite their hospitality and willingness. Hence do not wait until rawly bungling hands of men hack your God to pieces, but embrace him again, lovingly, until he has taken on the form of his first beginning. Let no human eye see the much loved, terribly splendid one in the state of his illness and lack of power. Consider that your fellow men are animals without knowing it. So long as they go to pasture, or lie in the sun, or suckle their young, or mate with each other, they are beautiful and harmless creatures of dark Mother Earth. But if the God appears, they begin to rave, since the nearness of God makes people rave. They tremble with fear and fury and suddenly attack one another in fratricidal struggles, since one senses the approaching God in the other. So conceal the God that you have taken with you. Let them rave and maul each other. Your voice is too weak for those raging to be able to hear. Thus do not speak and do not show the God, but sit in a solitary place and sing incantations in the ancient manner:</p>
<p>Set the egg before you, the God in his beginning.</p>
<p>And behold it.</p>
<p>And incubate it with the magical warmth of your gaze.</p>
<p>HERE THE INCANTATIONS BEGIN. 49/50</p>

<p><em>that was small.</em></p>
<p><em>I exchanged my furthest goal for the nearest, and so I am ready.</em></p>
<p>[Image 61]131</p>
<p>61/62 [HI 62] However, I am not ready, since I have still not accepted that which chokes my heart. That fearful thing is the enclosing of the God in the egg. I am happy that the great endeavor has been successful, but my fear made me forget the hazards involved. I love and admire the powerful. No one is greater than he with the bull’s horns, and yet I lamed, carried, and made him smaller with ease. I almost slumped to the ground with fear when I saw him, and now I rescue him with a cupped hand. These are the powers that make you afraid and conquer you; these have been your Gods and your rulers since time immemorial: yet you can put them in your pocket. What is blasphemy compared to this? I would like to be able to blaspheme against the God: That way I would at least have a God whom I could insult, but it is not worth blaspheming against an egg that one carries in one’s pocket. That is a God against whom one cannot even blaspheme.</p>
<p>I hated this pitifulness of the God. My own unworthiness is already enough. It cannot bear my encumbering it with the pitifulness of the God. Nothing stands firm: you touch yourself and you turn to dust. You touch the God and he hides terrified in the egg. You force the gates of Hell: the sound of cackling masks and the music of fools approaches you. You storm Heaven: stage scenery totters and the prompter in the box falls into a swoon. You notice: you are not true, it is not true above, it is not true below, left and right are deceptions. Wherever you grasp is air, air, air.</p>
<p>But I have caught him, he who has been feared since time immemorial; I have made him small and my hand surrounds him. That is the demise of the Gods: man puts them in his pocket. That is the end of the story of the Gods. Nothing remains of the Gods other than an egg. And I possess this egg. Perhaps I can eradicate this last one and with this finally exterminate the race of Gods. Now that I know that the Gods have yielded to my power—what are the Gods to me now? Old and overripe, they have fallen and been buried in an egg.</p>
<p>But how did this happen? I felled the Great One, I mourned him, I did not want to leave him, since I loved him because no mortal being rivals him. Out of love I devised the trick that relieved him of heaviness and freed him from the confines of space. I took from him—out of love—form and corporeality. I enclosed him lovingly in the maternal egg. Should I slay him, the defenseless one whom I loved? Should I shatter the delicate shell of his grave, and expose him to the weightlessness and unboundedness of the winds of the world? But did I not sing the incantations for his incubation? Did I not do this out of love for him? Why do I love him? I do not want to tear the love for the Great One from my heart. I want to love my God, the defenseless and hopeless one. I want to care for him, like a child.</p>
<p>Are we not sons of the Gods? Why should Gods not be our children? If my father the God should die, a God child should arise from my maternal heart. Since I love the God and do not want to leave him. Only he who loves the God can make him fall, and the God submits to his vanquisher and nestles in his hand and dies in the heart of him who loves him and promises him birth.</p>
<p><em>My God, I love you as a mother loves the unborn whom she carries in her heart. Grow in the egg of the East, nourish yourself from my love, drink the juice of my life so that you will become a radiant God. We need your light, Oh child. Since we go in darkness, light up our paths. May your light shine before us, may your fire warm the coldness of our life. We do not need your power but life.</em></p>
<p>62/63 What does power avail us? We do not want to rule. We want to live, we want light and warmth, and hence we need yours. Just as the greening earth and every living body needs the sun, so we as spirits need your light and your warmth. A sunless spirit becomes the parasite of the body. But the God feeds the spirit.

<p>The Opening of the Egg.134</p>
<p>Cap. xi.</p>
<p>[HI 65] 135<em>On the evening of the third day, I kneel down on the rug and carefully open the egg. Something resembling smoke rises up from it and suddenly Izdubar is standing before me, enormous, transformed, and complete. His limbs are whole and I find no trace of damage on them. It’s as if he had awoken from a deep sleep. He says:</em></p>
<p><em>“Where am I? How narrow it is here, how dark, how cool—am I</em></p>
<p><em>in the grave? Where was I? It seemed to me as if I had been outside in the universe—over and under me was an endlessly dark star-glittering sky—</em></p>
<p><em>and I was in a passion of unspeakable yearning.</em></p>
<p><em>Streams of fire broke from my radiating body—</em></p>
<p><em>I surged through blazing flames—</em></p>
<p><em>I swam in a sea that wrapped me in living fires—</em></p>
<p><em>Full of light, full of longing, full of eternity—</em></p>
<p><em>I was ancient and perpetually renewing myself—</em></p>
<p><em>Falling from the heights to the depths,</em></p>
<p><em>and whirled glowing from the depths to the heights—</em></p>
<p><em>hovering around myself amidst glowing clouds—</em></p>
<p><em>as raining embers beating down like the foam of the surf, engulfing</em></p>
<p><em>65/66 myself in stifling heat—</em></p>
<p><em>Embracing and rejecting myself in a boundless game—</em></p>
<p><em>Where was I? I was completely sun.” 136</em></p>
<p>I: “Oh Izdubar! Divine one! How wonderful! You are healed!”</p>
<p><em>“Healed? Was I ever sick? Who speaks of sickness? I was sun, completely sun. I am the sun.”</em></p>
<p>An inexpressible light breaks from his body, a light that my eyes cannot grasp. I must cover my face and cast my gaze to the ground.</p>
<p>I: “You are the sun, the eternal light—most powerful one, forgive me for carrying you.”</p>
<p>Everything is quiet and dark. I look around me: the empty egg shell is lying on the rug. I feel myself, the floor, the walls: everything is as usual, utterly plain and utterly real. I would like to say that everything around me has turned to gold. But it is not true—everything is as it always has been. Here reigned eternal light, immeasurable and overpowering.137</p>
<p>[2] [HI 66] It happened that I opened the egg and that the God left the egg. He was healed and his figure shone transformed, and I knelt like a child and could not grasp the miracle. He who had been pressed into the core of the beginning rose up, and no trace of illness could be found on him. And when I thought that I had caught the mighty one and held him in my cupped hands, he was the sun itself.</p>
<p>I wandered toward the East where the sun rises. I probably wanted to rise, too, as if I were the sun. I wanted to embrace the sun and rise with it into daybreak. But it came toward me and stood in my way. It told me that I had no chance of reaching the beginning. But I lamed the one who wanted to rush down in order to set with the sun in the womb of the night; he was deprived of all hope of reaching the blessed Western lands.</p>
<p>But behold! I caught the sun without realizing it and carried it in my hand. He who wanted to go down with the sun found me through his downgoing. I became his nocturnal mother who incubated the egg of the beginning. And he rose up, renewed, reborn to greater splendor.</p>
<p>While he rises, however, I go down. When I conquered the God, his force streamed into me. But when the God rested in the egg and awaited his beginning, my force went into him. And when he rose up radiantly, I lay on my face. He took my life with him. All my force was now in him. My soul swam like a fish in his sea of fire. But I lay in the frightful cool of the shadows of the earth and sank down deeper and deeper to the lowest darkness. All light had left me. The God rose in the Eastern lands and I fell into the horror of the underworld. I lay there like a child-bearer cruelly mauled and bleeding her life into the child, uniting life and death in a dying glance, the day’s mother, the night’s prey. My God had torn me apart terribly, he had drunk the juice of my life, he had drunk my highest power into him and became marvelous and strong like the sun, an unblemished God who bore no stigma or flaw. He had taken my wings from me, he had robbed me of the swelling force of my muscles, and the power of my will disappeared with him. He left me powerless and groaning.</p>
<p>66/67 I did not know what was happening to me, since simply everything powerful, beautiful, blissful, and superhuman had leaked from my maternal womb; none of the radiant gold remained. Cruelly and unthinkably the sunbird spread its wings and flew up into infinite space. I was left with the broken shells and the miserable casing of his beginning; the emptiness of the depths opened beneath me.</p>
<p>Woe betide the mother who gives birth to a God! If she gives birth to a wounded and pain-stricken God, a sword will pierce her soul. But if she gives birth to an unblemished God, then Hell will open to her, from which monstrous serpents will rise convulsively to suffocate the mother with miasma. Birth is difficult, but a thousand times more difficult is the hellish afterbirth.138 All the dragons and monstrous serpents of eternal emptiness follow behind the divine son.</p>
<p>What remains of human nature when the God has become mature and has seized all power? Everything incompetent, everything powerless, everything eternally vulgar, everything adverse and unfavorable, everything reluctant, diminishing, exterminating, everything absurd, everything that the unfathomable night of matter encloses in itself, that is the afterbirth of the God and his hellish and dreadfully deformed brother.</p>
<p>The God suffers when man does not accept his darkness. Consequently men must have a suffering God, so long as they suffer from evil. To suffer from evil means: you still love evil and yet love it no longer. You still hope to gain something, but you do not want to look closely for fear that you might discover that you still love evil. The God suffers because you continue to suffer from loving evil. You do not suffer from evil because you recognize it, but because it affords you secret pleasure, and because you believe it promises the pleasure of an unknown opportunity.</p>
<p>So long as your God suffers, you have sympathy with him and with yourself. You thus spare your Hell and prolong his suffering. If you want to make him well without engaging in secret sympathy with yourself, evil puts a spoke in your wheel—the evil whose form you generally recognize, but whose hellish strength in yourself you do not know. Your unknowing stems from the previous harmlessness of your life, from the peaceful passage of time, and from the absence of the God. But if the God draws near, your essence starts to seethe and the black mud of the depths whirls up.</p>
<p>Man stands between emptiness and fullness. If his strength combines with fullness, it becomes fully formative. There is always something good about such formation. If his strength combines with emptiness, it has a dissolving and destructive effect, since emptiness can never be formed, but only strives to satisfy itself at the cost of fullness. Combined thus human force turns emptiness into evil. If your force shapes fullness, it does so because of its association with fullness. But to ensure that your formation continues to exist, it must remain tied to your strength. Through constant shaping, you gradually lose your force, since ultimately all force is associated with the shapeliness that has been given form. Ultimately, where you mistakenly imagine that you are rich, you have actually become poor, and you stand amidst your forms like a beggar. That is when the blinded man is seized by an increasing desire to give shape to things, since he believes that manifold increased formation will satisfy his desire. Because he has spent his force, he becomes desirous; he begins to compel others into his service and takes their force to pursue his own designs.</p>
<p>In this moment, you need evil. When you notice that your strength is coming to an end and desire sets in, you must withdraw it from what has been formed into your emptiness; through this association with the emptiness you will succeed in dissolving the formation in you. You will thus regain your freedom, in that you have saved your strength from oppressive association with the object. So long as you persist with the standpoint of the good, you cannot dissolve your formation, precisely because it is what is good. You cannot dissolve good with good. You can dissolve good only with evil. For your good also leads ultimately to death through its progressive binding of your force by progressively binding your force. You are entirely unable to live without evil.</p>
<p>Your shaping first produces an image of your formation within you. This image remains in you and 67/68 it is the first and unmediated expression of your shaping. It then produces precisely through this image an outer one, which can exist without you and outlive you. Your strength is not directly linked to your outer formation, but only through the image that remains in you. When you set about dissolving your formation with evil, you do not destroy the outer shape, or else you would be destroying your own work. But what you do destroy is the image that you have formed in yourself. For it is this image that clings to your force. You will need evil to dissolve your formation, and to free yourself from the power of what has been, to the same extent which this image fetters your strength.</p>
<p>Hence their formation causes many good persons to bleed to death, because they cannot attend to evil in the same measure. The better one is and the more attached one is to one’s formation, the more one will lose one’s force. But what happens when the good person has lost their force completely to their formation? Not only will they seek to force others into the service of their formation with unconscious cunning and power, but they will also become bad in their goodness without knowing it, since their longing for satisfaction and strengthening will make them more and more selfish. But because of this the good ones will ultimately destroy their own work, and all those whom they forced into the service of their own work will become their enemies, because they will have alienated them. But you will also secretly begin to hate whoever alienates you from yourself against your own wishes, even if this were in the best interest of things. Unfortunately, the good person who has bound his strength will all too easily find slaves for his service, since there are more than plenty who yearn for nothing more strongly than to be alienated from themselves under a good pretext.</p>
<p>You suffer from evil because you love it secretly and are unaware of your love. You wish to escape your predicament, and you begin to hate evil. And once more you are bound to evil through your hate, since whether you love or hate it, it makes no difference: you are bound to evil. Evil is to be accepted. What we want remains in our hands. What we do not want, and yet is stronger than us, sweeps us away and we cannot stop it without damaging ourselves, for our force remains in evil. Thus we probably have to accept our evil without love and hate, recognizing that it exists and must have its share in life. In doing so, we can deprive it of the power it has to overwhelm us.</p>
<p>When we have succeeded in making a God, and if through this creation our whole force has entered into this design, we are filled with an overwhelming desire to rise with the divine sun and to become a part of its magnificence. But we forget that we are then no more than hollow forms, since giving form to God has sapped us completely. We are not only poor but have become sluggish matter throughout, which would never be entitled to share in divinity.</p>
<p>Like a terrible suffering or an inescapable devilish persecution, the misery and neediness of our matter creeps up on us. The powerless matter begins to suckle and would like to swallow its shape back into itself again. But since we are always enamored of our own design, we believe that the God calls us to him, and we make desperate attempts to follow the God into the higher realm, or we turn preachingly and demandingly to our fellow men to at any rate force others into following the God. Unfortunately there are men who allow themselves to be persuaded into doing this, to their and our detriment.</p>
<p>Much undoing resides in this urge: since who could suspect that he who has made the God is himself condemned to Hell? But this is the way it is, because the matter that is stripped of the divine radiance of force is empty and dark. If the God alights from matter, we feel the emptiness of matter as one part of endless empty space.</p>
<p>Through haste and increased willing and action we want to escape from emptiness and also from evil. But the right way is that we accept emptiness, destroy the image of the form within us, negate the God, and descend into the abyss and awfulness of matter. The God as our work stands outside us and no longer needs our help. He is created and remains left to his own devices. A created work that perishes again immediately once we turn away from it is not worth anything, even if it 68/69 were a God.</p>
<p>But where is the God after his creation and after his separation from me? If you build a house, you see it standing in the outer world. When you have created a God whom you cannot see with your own eyes, then he is in the spiritual world that is no less valuable than the outer physical world. He is there and does everything for you and others that you would expect from a God.</p>
<p>Thus your soul is your own self in the spiritual world. As the abode of the spirits, however, the spiritual world is also an outer world. Just as you are also not alone in the visible world, but are surrounded by objects that belong to you and obey only you, you also have thoughts that belong to you and obey only you. But just as you are surrounded in the visible world by things and beings that neither belong to you nor obey you, you are also surrounded in the spiritual world by thoughts and beings of thought that neither obey you nor belong to you. Just as you engender or bear your physical children, and just as they grow up and separate themselves from you to live their own fate, you also produce or give birth to beings of thought which separate themselves from you and live their own lives. Just as we leave our children when we grow old and give our body back to the earth, I separate myself from my God, the sun, and sink into the emptiness of matter and obliterate the image of my child in me. This happens in that I accept the nature of matter and allow the force of my form to flow into emptiness. Just as I gave birth anew to the sick God through my engendering force, I henceforth animate the emptiness of matter from which the formation of evil grows.</p>
<p><em>Nature is playful and terrible. Some see the playful side and dally with it and let it sparkle. Others see the horror and cover their heads and are more dead than alive. The way does not lead between both, but embraces both. It is both cheerful play and cold horror</em>.139 [Image 69]140 69/73 [Image 70] 70/73 [Image 71]141 71/73 [Image 72]. 72/73</p>
<p>Hell</p>
<p>Cap. xii</p>
<p>[HI 73] On the second night142 after the creation of my God, a vision made known to me that I had reached the underworld.</p>
<p>I find myself in a gloomy vault, whose floor consists of damp stone slabs. In the middle there is a column from which ropes and axes hang. At the foot of the column there lies an awful serpentlike tangle of human bodies. At first I catch sight of the figure of a young maiden with wonderful red-gold hair—a man of devilish appearance is lying half under her—his head is bent backward—a thin streak of blood runs down his forehead—two similar daimons have thrown themselves over the maiden’s feet and body. Their faces bear an inhuman expression—the living evil—their muscles are taut and hard, and their bodies sleek like serpents. They lie motionless. The maiden holds her hand over one eye of the man lying beneath her, who is the most powerful of the three—her hand firmly clasps a small silver fishing rod that she has driven into the eye of the devil.</p>
<p>I break out in a profuse cold sweat. They wanted to torture the maiden to death, but she defended herself with the force of the most extreme despair, and succeeded in piercing the eye of the evil one with the little hook. If he moves, she will tear out his eye with a final jerk. The horror paralyzes me: what will happen? A voice speaks:</p>
<p><em>“The evil one cannot make a sacrifice, he cannot sacrifice his eye, victory is with the one who can sacrifice.”</em> 143</p>
<p>[2] The vision vanished. I saw that my soul had fallen into the power of abysmal evil. The power of evil is unquestionable, and we rightfully fear it. Here no prayers, no pious words, no magical sayings help. Once raw power comes after you, there is no help. Once evil seizes you without pity, no father, no mother, no right, no wall and tower, no armor and protective power come to your aid. You fall powerless and forlorn into the hand of the superior power of evil. In this battle you are all alone. Because I wanted to give birth to my God, I also wanted evil. He who wants to create an eternal fullness will also create eternal emptiness.144 You cannot undertake one without the other. But if you want to escape evil, you will create no God, everything that you do is tepid and gray. I wanted my God at any cost. Hence I also want my evil. If my God were not overpowering, neither would be my evil. But I want my God to be powerful and beyond all measure happy and lustrous. Only in this way do I love my God. And the luster of his beauty will also have me taste the very bottom of Hell.</p>
<p>My God rose in the Eastern sky, brighter than the heavenly host, and brought about a new day for all the peoples. This is why I want to go to Hell. Would a mother not want to give up her life for her child? How much easier would it be to give up my life if only my God could overcome the torment of the last hour of the night and victoriously break through the red mist of the morning? I do not doubt: I also want evil for the sake of my God. I enter the unequal battle, since it is always unequal and without doubt a lost cause. How terrible and despairing would this battle be otherwise? But precisely this is how it should and will be.</p>
<p>73/74 Nothing is more valuable to the evil one than his eye, since only through his eye can emptiness seize gleaming fullness. Because the emptiness lacks fullness, it craves fullness and its shining power. And it drinks it in by means of its eye, which is able to grasp the beauty and unsullied radiance of fullness. The emptiness is poor, and if it lacked its eye it would be hopeless. It sees the most beautiful and wants to devour it in order to spoil it. The devil knows what is beautiful, and hence he is the shadow of beauty and follows it everywhere, awaiting the moment when the beautiful, writhing great with child, seeks to give life to the God.</p>
<p>If your beauty grows, the dreadful worm will also creep up you, waiting for its prey. Nothing is sacred to him except his eye, with which he sees the most beautiful. He will never give up his eye. He is invulnerable, but nothing protects his eye; it is delicate and clear, adept at drinking in the eternal light. It wants you, the bright red light of your life.</p>
<p>I recognize the fearful devilishness of human nature. I cover my eyes before it. I put out my hand to fend it off, if anyone wants to approach me for fear that my shadow could fall on him, or his shadow could fall on me, since I also see the devilish in him, who is the harmless companion of his shadow.</p>
<p>No one touches me, death and crime lie in wait for you and me. You smile innocently, my friend? Don’t you see that a gentle flickering of your eye betrays the frightfulness whose unsuspecting messenger you are? Your bloodthirsty tiger growls softly, your poisonous serpent hisses secretly, while you, conscious only of your goodness, offer your human hand to me in greeting. I know your shadow and mine, that follows and comes with us, and only waits for the hour of twilight when he will strangle you and me with all the daimons of the night.</p>
<p>What abyss of blood-dripping history separates you from me! I grasped your hand and looked at you. I lay my head in your lap and felt the living warmth of your body on mine as if it were my own body—and suddenly I felt a smooth cord around my neck, which choked me mercilessly, and a cruel hammer blow struck a nail into my temple. I was dragged by my feet along the pavement, and wild hounds gnawed my body in the lonely night.</p>
<p>No one should be astonished that men are so far removed from one another that they cannot understand one another, that they wage war and kill one another. One should be much more surprised that men believe they are close, understand one another and love one another. Two things are yet to be discovered. The first is the infinite gulf that separates us from one another. The second is the bridge that could connect us. Have you considered how much unsuspected animality human company makes possible?</p>
<p>145When my soul fell into the hands of evil, it was defenseless except for the weak fishing rod which it could use, again with its power, to pull the fish from the sea of emptiness. The eye of the evil one sucked in all the force of my soul; only its will remained, which is just that small fish hook. I wanted evil, since I realized that I was not able to elude it. And because I wanted evil, my soul held the precious hook in its hand, that was supposed to strike the vulnerable place of the evil one. He who does not want evil will have no chance to save his soul from Hell. So long as he remains in the light of the upper world, he will become a shadow of himself. But his soul will languish in the dungeons of the daimons. This will act as a counterbalance that will forever constrain him. The higher circles of the inner world will remain unattainable for him. He remains where he was; indeed, he falls back. You know these people, and you know how extravagantly nature strews 74/75 human life and force on barren deserts. You should not lament this, otherwise you will become a prophet, and will seek to redeem what cannot be redeemed. Do you not know that nature also dungs its fields with men? Take in the seeker, but do not go out seeking those who err. What do you know about their error? Perhaps it is sacred. You should not disturb the sacred. Do not look back and regret nothing. You see many near you fall? You feel compassion? But you should live your life, since then at least one in a thousand will remain. You cannot halt dying.</p>
<p>But why did my soul not tear out the eye of the evil one? The evil one has many eyes, and losing one amounts to losing none. But if she had done it, she would have come completely under the spell of the evil one. The evil one can only fail to make sacrifice. You should not harm him, above all not his eye, since the most beautiful would not exist if the evil one did not see it and long for it. The evil one is holy.</p>
<p>There is nothing the emptiness can sacrifice, since it always suffers lack. Only fullness can sacrifice, since it has fullness. Emptiness cannot sacrifice its hunger for fullness, since it cannot deny its own essence. Therefore we also need evil. But I can sacrifice my will to evil, because I previously received fullness. All strength flows back to me again, since the evil one has destroyed the image I had of the formation of the God. But the image of the God’s formation in me was not yet destroyed. I dread this destruction, since it is terrible, an unprecedented desecration of temples. Everything in me strives against this abysmal abomination. For I still did not know what it means to give birth to a God. [Image 75] 75/76</p>
<p>The Sacrificial Murder.146</p>
<p>Cap. xiii.</p>
<p>[HI 76] But this was the vision that I did not want to see, the horror that I did not want to live: A sickening feeling of nausea sneaks up on me, and abominable, perfidious serpents wind their way slowly and cracklingly through parched undergrowth; they hang down lazily and disgustingly lethargic from the branches, looped in dreadful knots. I am reluctant to enter this dreary and unsightly valley, where the bushes stand in arid stony defiles. The valley looks so normal, its air smells of crime, of foul, cowardly deeds. I am seized by disgust and horror. I walk hesitantly over the boulders, avoiding every dark place for fear of treading on a serpent. The sun shines weakly out of a gray and distant sky, and all the leaves are shriveled. A marionette with a broken head lies before me amidst the stones—a few steps further, a small apron—and then behind the bush, the body of a small girl—covered with terrible wounds—smeared with blood. One foot is clad with a stocking and shoe, the other is naked and gorily crushed—the head—where is the head? The head is a mash of blood with hair and whitish pieces of bone, surrounded by stones smeared with brain and blood. My gaze is captivated by this awful sight—a shrouded figure, like that of a woman, is standing calmly next to the child; her face is covered by an impenetrable veil. She asks me:</p>
<p>S: “What then do you say?”</p>
<p>I: “What should I say? This is beyond words.”</p>
<p>S: “Do you understand this?”</p>
<p>I: “I refuse to understand such things. I can’t speak about them without becoming enraged.”</p>
<p>S: “Why become enraged? You might as well rage every day of your life, for these and similar things occur every day.”</p>
<p>I: “But most of the time we don’t see them.”</p>
<p>S: “So knowing that they happen is not enough to enrage you?”</p>
<p>I: “If I merely have knowledge of something, it’s easier and simpler. The horror is less real if all I have is knowledge.”</p>
<p>S: “Step nearer and you will see that the body of the child has been cut open; take out the liver.”</p>
<p>I: “I will not touch this corpse. If someone witnessed this, they would think that I’m the murderer.”</p>
<p>S: “You are cowardly; take out the liver.”</p>
<p>I: “Why should I do this? This is absurd.”</p>
<p>S: “I want you to remove the liver. You must do it.”</p>
<p>I: “Who are you to give me such an order?”</p>
<p>S: “I am the soul of this child. You must do this for my sake.”</p>
<p>I: “I don’t understand, but I’ll believe you and do this horrific and absurd deed.” 76/77</p>
<p>I reach into the child’s visceral cavity—it is still warm—the liver is still firmly attached—I take my knife and cut it free of the ligaments. Then I take it out and hold it with bloody hands toward the figure.</p>
<p>S: “I thank you.”</p>
<p>I: “What should I do?”</p>
<p>S: “You know what the liver means, and you ought to perform the healing act with it.”147</p>
<p>I: “What is to be done?”</p>
<p>S: “Take a piece of the liver, in place of the whole, and eat it.”</p>
<p>I: “What are you demanding? This is absolute madness. This is desecration, necrophilia. You make me a guilty party to this most hideous of all crimes.”</p>
<p>S: “You have devised the most horrible torment for the murderer, which could atone for his act. There is only one atonement: abase yourself and eat.”</p>
<p>I: “I cannot—I refuse—I cannot participate in this horrible guilt.”</p>
<p>S: “You share in this guilt.”</p>
<p>I: “I? Share in this guilt?”</p>
<p>S: “You are a man, and a man has committed this deed.”</p>
<p>I: “Yes, I am a man—I curse whoever did this for being a man, and I curse myself for being a man.”</p>
<p>S: “So, take part in his act, abase yourself and eat. I need atonement.”</p>
<p>I: “So shall it be for your sake, as you are the soul of this child.”</p>
<p>I kneel down on the stone, cut off a piece of the liver and put it in my mouth. My gorge rises—tears burst from my eyes—cold sweat covers my brow—a dull sweet taste of blood—I swallow with desperate efforts—it is impossible—once again and once again—I almost faint—it is done. The horror has been accomplished.148</p>
<p>S: “I thank you.”</p>
<p>She throws her veil back—a beautiful maiden with ginger hair.</p>
<p>S: “Do you recognize me?”</p>
<p>I: “How strangely familiar you are! Who are you?”</p>
<p>S: “I am your soul.”149</p>
<p>[2] The sacrifice has been accomplished: the divine child, the image of the God’s formation, is slain, and I have eaten from the sacrificial flesh.150 The child, that is, the image of the God’s formation, not only bore my human craving, but also enclosed all the primordial and elemental powers that the sons of the sun possess as an inalienable inheritance. The God needs all this for his genesis. But when he has been created and hastens away into unending space, we need the gold of the sun. We must regenerate ourselves. But as the creation of a God is a creative act of highest love, the restoration of our human life signifies an act of the Below. This is a great and dark mystery. Man cannot accomplish this act solely by himself, but is assisted by evil, which does it instead of man. But man must recognize his complicity in the act of evil. He must bear witness to this recognition by eating from the bloody sacrificial flesh. Through this act he testifies that he is a man, that he recognizes good as well as evil, and that he destroys the image of the God’s formation through withdrawing his life force, with which he also dissociates himself from the God. This occurs for the salvation of the soul, which is the true mother of the divine child. 77/78</p>
<p>When it bore and gave birth to the God, my soul was of human nature throughout; it possessed the primordial powers since time immemorial, but only in a dormant condition. They flowed into forming the God without my help. But through the sacrificial murder, I redeemed the primordial powers and added them to my soul. Since they became part of a living pattern, they are no longer dormant, but awake and active and irradiate my soul with their divine working. Through this it receives a divine attribute. Hence the eating of the sacrificial flesh aided its healing. The ancients have also indicated this to us, in that they taught us to drink the blood and eat the flesh of the savior. The ancients believed that this brought healing to the soul.151</p>
<p>There are not many truths, there are only a few. Their meaning is too deep to grasp other than in symbols.152</p>
<p>A God who is no stronger than man—what is he? You still should taste holy dread. How would you be worthy of enjoying the wine and the bread if you have not touched the black bottom of human nature? Hence you are lukewarm and pale shadows, proud of your shallow coastlines and broad country roads. But the floodgates will be opened, there are inexorable things, from which only God can save you.</p>
<p>The primordial force is the radiance of the sun, which the sons of the sun have carried in themselves for aeons and pass on to their children. But if the soul dips into radiance, she becomes as remorseless as the God himself, since the life of the divine child, which you have eaten, will feel like glowing coals in you. It will burn inside you like a terrible, inextinguishable fire. But despite all the torment, you cannot let it be, since it will not let you be. From this you will understand that your God is alive and that your soul has begun wandering on remorseless paths. You feel that the fire of the sun has erupted in you. Something new has been added to you, a holy affliction.</p>
<p>Sometimes you no longer recognize yourself. You want to overcome it, but it overcomes you. You want to set limits, but it compels you to keep going. You want to elude it, but it comes with you. You want to employ it, but you are its tool; you want to think about it, but your thoughts obey it. finally the fear of the inescapable seizes you, for it comes after you slowly and invincibly.</p>
<p>There is no escape. So it is that you come to know what a real God is. Now you’ll think up clever truisms, preventive measures, secret escape routes, excuses, potions capable of inducing forgetfulness, but it’s all useless. The fire burns right through you. That which guides forces you onto the way.</p>
<p>But the way is my own self, my own life founded upon myself. The God wants my life. He wants to go with me, sit at the table with me, work with me. Above all he wants to be ever-present.153 But I’m ashamed of my God. I don’t want to be divine but reasonable. The divine appears to me as irrational craziness. I hate it as an absurd disturbance of my meaningful human activity. It seems an unbecoming sickness which has stolen into the regular course of my life. Yes, I even find the divine superfluous. 78/90 [Image 79] 79/90 [Image 80] 80/90 [Image 81] 81/90 [Image 82] 82/90 [Image 83] 83/90 [Image 84]154 84/90 [Image 85] 85/90 [Image 86] 86/90 [Image 87] 87/90 [Image 88] 88/90 [Image 89]155 89/90 [Image 90] 90/95 [Image 91] 91/95 [Image 92] 92/95 [Image 93]156 93/95 [Image 94]157 94/95 [Image 95] 95/98 [Image 96] 96/98 [Image 97] 97/98</p>
<p>Divine Folly158</p>
<p>Cap. xiv.</p>
<p>[HI 98]159I am standing in a high hall. Before me I see a green curtain between two columns. The curtain parts easily. I see into a small deep room with bare walls. There is a small window with bluish glass above. I set foot on the stair leading up to this room between the pillars and enter. In the rear wall, I see a door right and left. It’s as if I must choose between right and left.</p>
<p>I choose the right. The door is open, I enter: I’m in the reading room of a large library. In the background sits a small thin man of pale complexion, apparently the librarian. The atmosphere is troubling—scholarly ambitions—scholarly conceit—wounded scholarly vanity. Apart from the librarian I see no one. I step toward him. He looks up from his book and says, “What do you want?”</p>
<p>I’m somewhat embarrassed, since I don’t know what I really want: Thomas à Kempis crosses my mind.</p>
<p>I: “I’d like to have Thomas à Kempis’s <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>.”160</p>
<p>He looks at me somewhat astonished as if he didn’t credit me with such an interest; he gives me an order-form to fill out. I too think that it’s astonishing to ask for Thomas à Kempis.</p>
<p>“Are you surprised that I’m requesting Thomas’s work?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, the book is seldom asked for, and I wouldn’t have expected this interest from you.”</p>
<p>“I must confess that I’m also somewhat surprised by this inspiration, but recently I came across a passage from Thomas that made a particular impression on me. Why, I can’t really say. If I remember correctly, it dealt with the problem of the Imitation of Christ.”</p>
<p>“Do you have particular theological or philosophical interests, or—”</p>
<p>“Do you mean—whether I want to read it for the purpose of prayer?”</p>
<p>“Well, hardly.”</p>
<p>“If I read Thomas à Kempis, I do so for the sake of prayer, or something similar, rather than out of scholarly interest.”</p>
<p>“Are you that religious? I had no idea.”</p>
<p>“You know that I value science extraordinarily highly. But there are actually moments in life where science also leaves us empty and sick. In such moments a book like Thomas’s means very much to me since it is written from the soul.”</p>
<p>“But somewhat old-fashioned. We can no longer get involved in Christian dogmatics these days, surely.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t come to an end with Christianity by simply putting it aside. It seems to me that there’s more to it than we see.”</p>
<p>“What is there about it? It’s just a religion.” 98/99</p>
<p>“For what reasons and moreover at what age do men set it aside? Presumably, most do so during their student days or perhaps even earlier. Would you call that a particularly discriminating age? And have you ever examined more closely the grounds on which people put aside positive religion? The grounds are mostly dubious, such as that the contents of belief clash with natural science or philosophy.”</p>
<p>“In my view, such an objection should not necessarily be rejected out of hand, despite the fact that there are better reasons. For example, I consider the lack of a true and proper sense of actuality in religion a disadvantage. Incidentally, a host of substitutes now exists for the loss of opportunity for prayer caused by the collapse of religion. Nietzsche, for example, has written a more than veritable book of prayer,161 not to mention <em>Faust</em>.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s correct in a certain sense. But especially Nietzsche’s truth strikes me as too agitated and provocative—; it’s good for those who are yet to be set free. For that reason his truth is good only for them. I believe that I’ve recently discovered that we also need a truth for those who are forced into a corner. It’s possible that instead they need a depressive truth, which makes man smaller and more inward.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, but Nietzsche interiorizes man exceptionally well.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps from your standpoint you’re right, but I can’t help feeling that Nietzsche speaks to those who need more freedom, not to those who clash strongly with life, who bleed from wounds, and who hold fast to actualities.”</p>
<p>“But Nietzsche confers a precious feeling of superiority upon such people.”</p>
<p>“I can’t dispute that, but I know men who need inferiority, not superiority.”</p>
<p>“You express yourself very paradoxically. I don’t understand you. Inferiority can hardly be a desideratum.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you’ll understand me better if instead of inferiority I say resignation, a word that one used to hear a lot of, but seldom anymore.”</p>
<p>“It also sounds very Christian.”</p>
<p>“As I said, there seem to be all sorts of things in Christianity that maybe one would do well to keep. Nietzsche is too oppositional. Like everything healthy and long-lasting, truth unfortunately adheres more to the middle way, which we unjustly abhor.”</p>
<p>“I really had no idea that you take such a mediating position.”</p>
<p>“Neither did I—my position is not entirely clear to me. If I mediate, I certainly mediate in a very peculiar manner.”</p>
<p>At this moment the servant brought the book, and I took my leave from the librarian.</p>
<p>[2] The divine wants to live with me. My resistance is in vain. I asked my thinking, and it said: “Take as your model one that shows you how to live the divine.” Our natural model is Christ. We have stood under his law since antiquity, first outwardly, and then inwardly. At first we knew this, and then knew it no longer. We fought against Christ, we deposed him, and we seemed to be conquerors. But he remained in us and mastered us.</p>
<p>It is better to be thrown into visible chains than into invisible ones. You can certainly leave Christianity but it does not leave you. Your liberation from it is delusion. Christ is the way. You can certainly run away, but then you are no longer on the way. The way of Christ ends on the cross. Hence we are crucified with him in ourselves. With him, we wait until we die for our resurrection.162 With Christ the living experience no resurrection, unless it occurs after death.163</p>
<p>If I imitate Christ, he is always ahead of me and I can never reach the goal, unless I reach it in him. 99/100 But thus I move beyond myself and beyond time, in and through which I am as I am. I thus blunder into Christ and his time, which created him thus and not otherwise. And so I am outside my time, despite the fact that my life is in this time and I am split between the life of Christ and my life that still belongs to this present time. But if I am truly to understand Christ, I must realize how Christ actually lived only his own life, and imitated no one. He did not emulate any model.164</p>
<p>If I thus truly imitate Christ, I do not imitate anyone, I emulate no one, but go my own way, and I will also no longer call myself a Christian. Initially, I wanted to emulate and imitate Christ by living my life, while observing his precepts. A voice in me protested against this and wanted to remind me that my time also had its prophets who struggle against the yoke with which the past burdens us. I did not succeed in uniting Christ with the prophets of this time. The one demands bearing, the other discarding; the one commands submission, the other the will.165 How should I think of this contradiction without doing injustice to either? What I could not conjoin in my mind probably lends itself to living one after the other.</p>
<p>And so I decided to cross over into lower and everyday life, my life, and to begin down there, where I stood.</p>
<p>When thinking leads to the unthinkable, it is time to return to simple life. What thinking cannot solve, life solves, and what action never decides is reserved for thinking. If I ascend to the highest and most difficult on the one hand, and seek to eke out redemption that reaches even higher, then the true way does not lead upward, but toward the depths, since only my other leads me beyond myself. But acceptance of the other means a descent into the opposite, from seriousness into the laughable, from suffering into the cheerful, from the beautiful into the ugly, from the pure into the impure.166</p>
<p>Nox secunda167</p>
<p>Cap. xv.</p>
<p>[HI 100] On leaving the library, I stood in the anteroom again.168 This time I look across to the door on the left. I put the small book into my pocket and go to the door; it is also open, and leads to a large kitchen, with a large chimney over the stove. Two long tables stand in the middle of the room, flanked by benches. Brass pots, copper pans, and other vessels stand on shelves along the walls. A large fat woman is standing at the stove—apparently the cook—wearing a checkered apron. I greet her, somewhat astonished. She too seems embarrassed. I ask her: “May I sit down for a while? It’s cold outside and I must wait for something.”</p>
<p>“Please have a seat.”</p>
<p>She wipes the table in front of me. Having nothing else to do, I take out my Thomas and begin to read. The cook is curious and looks at me furtively. Every once in a while she goes past me.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, are you perhaps a clergyman?”</p>
<p>“No, why do you think so?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I just thought you might be because you are reading a small black book. My mother, may God rest her soul, left me such a book.”</p>
<p>“I see, and what book might that be?”</p>
<p>“It is called <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>. It’s a very beautiful book. I often pray with it in the evenings.”</p>
<p>“You have guessed well, I too am reading <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that a man like you would read such a book unless he were a pastor.”</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t I read it? It also does me good to read a proper book.”</p>
<p>“My mother, God bless her, had it with her on her deathbed, and she gave it to me before she died.”</p>
<p>I browse through the book absentmindedly while she is speaking. My eyes fall on the following 100/101 passage in the nineteenth chapter: “The righteous base their intentions more on the mercy of God, which in whatever they undertake they trust more than their own wisdom.”169</p>
<p>This is the intuitive method that Thomas recommends, it occurs to me.170 I turn to the cook: “Your mother was a clever woman, and she did well to give you this book.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, it has often comforted me in difficult hours and it always provides good counsel.”</p>
<p>I become immersed in my thoughts again: I believe one can also follow one’s own nose. That would also be171 the intuitive method. But the beautiful way in which Christ does this must nevertheless be of special value. I would like to imitate Christ—an inner disquiet seizes me—what is supposed to happen? I hear an odd swishing and whirring—and suddenly a roaring sound fills the room like a horde of large birds—with a frenzied flapping of wings—I see many shadowlike human forms rush past and I hear a manifold babble of voices utter the words: “Let us pray in the temple!”</p>
<p>“Where are you rushing off to?” I call out. A bearded man with tousled hair and dark shining eyes stops and turns toward me: “We are wandering to Jerusalem to pray at the most holy sepulcher.”</p>
<p>“Take me with you.”</p>
<p>172“You cannot join us, you have a body. But we are dead.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“I am Ezechiel, and I am an Anabaptist.”173</p>
<p>“Who are those wandering with you?”</p>
<p>“These are my fellow believers.”</p>
<p>“Why are you wandering?”</p>
<p>“We cannot stop, but must make a pilgrimage to all the holy places.”</p>
<p>“What drives you to this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But it seems that we still have no peace, although we died in true belief.”</p>
<p>“Why do you have no peace if you died in true belief?”</p>
<p>“It always seems to me as if we had not come to a proper end with life.”</p>
<p>“Remarkable—how so?”</p>
<p>“It seems to me that we forgot something important that should also have been lived.”</p>
<p>“And what was that?”</p>
<p>“Would you happen to know?”</p>
<p>With these words he reaches out greedily and uncannily toward me, his eyes shining as if from inner heat.</p>
<p>“Let go, daimon, you did not live your animal.”174</p>
<p>The cook is standing in front of me with a horrified face; she has taken me by the arm and grips me firmly. “For God’s sake,” she calls out, “Help, what’s wrong with you? Are you in a bad way?”</p>
<p>I look at her astonished and wonder where I really am. But soon strange people burst in—among them the librarian—infinitely astonished and dismayed at first, then laughing maliciously: “Oh, I might have known! Quick, the police!”</p>
<p>Before I can collect myself, I am pushed through a crowd of people into a van. I am still clutching my copy of Thomas and ask myself: “What would he say to this new situation?” I open the booklet and my eyes fall on the thirteenth chapter, where it says: “So long as we live here on earth, we cannot escape temptation. There is no man who is so perfect, and no saint so sacred, that he cannot be tempted on occasion. Yes, we can hardly be without temptation.”175</p>
<p>Wise Thomas, you always come up with the right answer. That crazy Anabaptist certainly had no such knowledge, or he might have made a peaceful end. He also could have read it in Cicero: <em>rerum omnium satietas vitae facit satietatem—satietas vitae tempus maturum mortis affert</em> [satiety of all things causes satiety of life—one is satiated with life and the time is ripe for death].176 This knowledge had evidently brought me into conflict with society. I was flanked by policemen left and right. “Well,” I said to them, “you can let me go now.” “Yes, we know all about this,” 101/102 one said laughing. “Now just you hold your peace,” said the other sternly. So, we are obviously heading for the madhouse. That is a high price to pay. But one can go this way too, it seems. It’s not so strange, since thousands of our fellows take that path.</p>
<p>We have arrived—a large gate, a hall—a friendly bustling superintendent—and now also two doctors. One of them is a small fat professor.</p>
<p>Pr: “What’s that book you’ve got there?”</p>
<p>“It’s Thomas à Kempis, <em>The Imitation of Christ.</em>”</p>
<p>Pr: “So, a form of religious madness, perfectly clear, religious paranoia.177—You see, my dear, nowadays, the imitation of Christ leads to the madhouse.”</p>
<p>“That is hardly to be doubted, professor.”</p>
<p>Pr: “The man has wit—he is obviously somewhat maniacally aroused. Do you hear voices?”</p>
<p>“You bet! Today it was a huge throng of Anabaptists that swarmed through the kitchen.”</p>
<p>Pr: “Now, there we have it. Are the voices following you?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, Heaven forbid, I summoned them.”</p>
<p>Pr: “Ah, this is yet another case that clearly indicates that hallucinations directly call up voices. This belongs in the case history. Would you immediately make a note of that, doctor?”</p>
<p>“With all due respect, Professor, may I say that it is absolutely not abnormal, but much rather the intuitive method.”</p>
<p>Pr: “Excellent. The fellow also uses neologisms. Well—I suppose we have an adequately clear diagnosis. Anyway, I wish you a good recovery, and make sure you stay quiet.”</p>
<p>“But professor, I’m not at all sick, I feel perfectly well.”</p>
<p>Pr: “Look, my dear. You don’t have any insight into your illness yet. The prognosis is naturally pretty bad, with at best limited recovery.”</p>
<p>Superintendent: “Professor, can the man keep the book?”</p>
<p>Pr: “Well, I suppose so, as it seems to be a harmless prayer book.”</p>
<p>Now my clothes are inventoried—then the bath—and now I’m taken off to the ward. I enter a large sickroom, where I’m told to get into bed. The person to my left is lying motionless with a transfixed gaze, while the one to the right appears to possess a brain whose girth and weight are shrinking. I enjoy perfect silence. The problem of madness is profound. Divine madness—a higher form of the irrationality of the life streaming through us—at any rate a madness that cannot be integrated into present-day society—but how? What if the form of society were integrated into madness? At this point things grow dark, and there is no end in sight.178</p>
<p>[2] [HI 102] The growing plant sprouts a sapling on its right-hand side, and when this is completely formed, the natural urge to grow will not develop beyond the final bud but flows back into the stem, into the mother of the sprig, paving an uncertain way in the dark and through the stem, and finally finding the right position on the left where it sprouts a new sapling. But this new direction of growth is completely opposed to the previous one. And yet the plant nevertheless grows regularly in this way, without overstraining or disturbing its balance.</p>
<p>On the right is my thinking, on the left is my feeling. I enter the space of my feeling which was previously unknown to me, and see with astonishment the difference between my two rooms. I cannot help laughing—many laugh instead of crying. I have stepped from the right foot onto the left, and wince, struck by inner pain. The difference between hot and cold is too great. I leave the spirit of this world which has thought Christ through to the end, and step over into that other funny-frightful realm in which I can find Christ again.</p>
<p>The “imitation of Christ” led me to the master himself and to his astonishing kingdom. I do not know what I want there; I can only follow the master who governs this other realm in me. In this realm other laws are valid than the guidelines of my wisdom. Here, the “mercy of God,” which I had never relied on, for good practical reasons, is the highest law of action. The “mercy of God” signifies a particular 102/103 state of the soul in which I entrust myself to all neighbors with trembling and hesitation and with the mightiest outlay of hope that everything will work out well.</p>
<p>I can no longer say that this or that goal should be reached, or that this or that reason should apply because it is good; instead I grope through mist and night. No line emerges, no law appears; instead everything is thoroughly and convincingly accidental, as a matter of fact even terribly accidental. But one thing becomes dreadfully clear, namely that contrary to my earlier way and all its insights and intentions, henceforth all is error. It becomes ever more apparent that nothing leads, as my hope sought to persuade me, but that everything misleads.</p>
<p>And suddenly to your shivering horror it becomes clear to you that you have fallen into the boundless, the abyss, the inanity of eternal chaos. It rushes toward you as if carried by the roaring wings of a storm, the hurtling waves of the sea.</p>
<p>Every man has a quiet place in his soul, where everything is self-evident and easily explainable, a place to which he likes to retire from the confusing possibilities of life, because there everything is simple and clear, with a manifest and limited purpose. About nothing else in the world can a man say with the same conviction as he does of this place: “You are nothing but. . . ” and indeed he has said it.</p>
<p>And even this place is a smooth surface, an everyday wall, nothing more than a snugly sheltered and frequently polished crust over the mystery of chaos. If you break through this most everyday of walls, the overwhelming stream of chaos will flood in. Chaos is not single, but an unending multiplicity. It is not formless, otherwise it would be single, but it is filled with figures that have a confusing and overwhelming effect due to their fullness.179</p>
<p>These figures are the dead, not just your dead, that is, all the images of the shapes you took in the past, which your ongoing life has left behind, but also the thronging dead of human history, the ghostly procession of the past, which is an ocean compared to the drops of your own life span. I see behind you, behind the mirror of your eyes, the crush of dangerous shadows, the dead, who look greedily through the empty sockets of your eyes, who moan and hope to gather up through you all the loose ends of the ages, which sigh in them. Your cluelessness does not prove anything. Put your ear to that wall and you will hear the rustling of their procession.</p>
<p>Now you know why you lodged the simplest and most easily explained matters in just that spot, why you praised that peaceful seat as the most secure: so that no one, least of all yourself, would unearth the mystery there. For this is the place where day and night agonizingly merge. What you excluded from your life, what you renounced and damned, everything that was and could have gone wrong, awaits you behind that wall before which you sit quietly.</p>
<p>If you read the books of history, you will find men who sought the strange and incredible, who ensnared themselves and who were held captive by others in wolves’ lairs; men who sought the highest and the lowest, and who were wiped by fate, incomplete, from the tablets of the living. Few of the living know of them, and these few appreciate nothing about them, but shake their heads at such delusion.</p>
<p>While you mock them, one of them stands behind you, panting from rage and despair at the fact that your stupor does not attend to him. He besieges you in sleepless nights, sometimes he takes hold of you in an illness, sometimes he crosses your intentions. He makes you overbearing and greedy, he pricks your longing for everything, which avails you nothing, he devours your success in discord. He accompanies you as your evil spirit, to whom you can grant no release.</p>
<p>Have you heard of those dark ones who roamed incognito alongside those who ruled the day, conspiratorially causing unrest? Who devised cunning things and did not shrink from any crime to honor their God?</p>
<p>Beside them place Christ, who was the greatest among them. It was too little for him to break the world, so he broke himself. And therefore he was the greatest of them all, and the powers of this world did not reach him. But I speak of the dead who fell prey to power, broken by force and not by themselves. Their hordes people the land of the soul. If you accept 103/104 them, they fill you with delusion and rebellion against what rules the world. From the deepest and from the highest they devised the most dangerous things. They were not of a common nature, but fine blades of the hardest steel. They would have nothing to do with the small lives of men. They lived on the heights and accomplished the lowest. They forgot only one thing: they did not live their animal.</p>
<p>The animal does not rebel against its own kind. Consider animals: how just they are, how well-behaved, how they keep to the time-honored, how loyal they are to the land that bears them, how they hold to their accustomed routes, how they care for their young, how they go together to pasture, and how they draw one another to the spring. There is not one that conceals its overabundance of prey and lets its brother starve as a result. There is not one that tries to enforce its will on those of its own kind. Not a one mistakenly imagines that it is an elephant when it is a mosquito. The animal lives fittingly and true to the life of its species, neither exceeding nor falling short of it.</p>
<p>He who never lives his animal must treat his brother like an animal. Abase yourself and live your animal so that you will be able to treat your brother correctly. You will thus redeem all those roaming dead who strive to feed on the living. And do not turn anything you do into a law, since that is the hubris of power.180</p>
<p>When the time has come and you open the door to the dead, your horrors will also afflict your brother, for your countenance proclaims the disaster. Hence withdraw and enter solitude, since no one can give you counsel if you wrestle with the dead. Do not cry for help if the dead surround you, otherwise the living will take flight, and they are your only bridge to the day. Live the life of the day and do not speak of mysteries, but dedicate the night to bringing about the salvation of the dead.</p>
<p>For whoever well-meaningly tears you away from the dead has rendered you the worst service, since he has torn your life branch from the tree of divinity. He also sins against restoring what was created and later subjugated and lost.181 “For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.”</p>
<p>Every step upward will restore a step downward so that the dead will be delivered into freedom. The creating of the new shrinks from the day since its essence is secret. It prepares the destruction of precisely this day in the hope of leading it over into a new creation. Something evil is attached to the creation of the new, which you cannot proclaim loudly. The animal that looks for new hunting grounds cowers slinking and sniffing on dark paths and does not want to be surprised.</p>
<p>Please consider that it is the suffering of the creative that they carry something evil in them, a leprosy of the soul that separates them from its danger. They could praise their leprosy as a virtue and could indeed do so out of virtuousness. But this would be doing what Christ does, and would therefore be his imitation. For only one was Christ and only one could violate the laws as he did. It is impossible to commit higher infringements on his path. Fulfill that which comes to you. Break the Christ in yourself so that you may arrive at yourself and ultimately at your animal which is well-behaved in its herd and unwilling to infringe its laws. May it suffice in terms of transgression that you do not imitate Christ, since thereby you take a step back from Christianity and a step beyond it. Christ brought salvation through adeptness, and ineptitude will save you.</p>
<p>Have you counted the dead whom the master of sacrifice honored? Have you asked them for whose sake they believe they have suffered death? Have you entered the beauty of their thoughts and the purity of their intention? “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.”182</p>
<p>Thus do penance, consider what fell victim to death for the sake of Christianity, lay it before you and force yourself to accept it. For the dead need salvation. The number of the unredeemed dead has become greater than the number of living Christians; therefore it is time that we accept the dead.183</p>
<p>Do not throw yourself against what has become, enraged or bent on destruction. What will you put in its place? Do you not know that if you are successful in destroying what has become, you will then turn the will of destruction against yourself? But anyone who makes destruction their goal will perish through self-destruction. Much rather respect what has become, since reverence is a blessing.</p>
<p>Then turn to the dead,184 listen to their lament and accept them with love. Be not their blind spokesman,185 104/106 [Image 105]186 105/106 there are prophets who in the end have stoned themselves. But we seek salvation and hence we need to revere what has become and to accept the dead, who have fluttered through the air and lived like bats under our roofs since time immemorial. The new will be built on the old and the meaning of what has become will become manifold. Your poverty in what has become you will thus deliver into the wealth of the future.</p>
<p>What seeks to distance you from Christianity and its holy rule of love are the dead, who could find no peace in the Lord since their uncompleted work has followed them. A new salvation is always a restoring of the previously lost. Did not Christ himself restore bloody human sacrifice, which better customs had expelled from sacred practice since days of old? Did he not himself reinstate the sacred practice of the eating of human sacrifice? In your sacred practice that which earlier laws condemned will once again be included.</p>
<p>However, just as Christ brought back human sacrifice and the eating of the sacrificed, all this happened to him and not to his brother, since Christ placed above it the highest law of love, so that no brother would come to harm as a result, but so that all could rejoice in the restoration. The same thing happened as in ancient times, but now under the law of love.187 So if you have no reverence for what has become, you will destroy the law of love.188 And what will become of you then? You will be forced to restore what was before, namely violent deeds, murder, wrongdoing, and contempt of your brother. And one will be alien to the other, and confusion will rule.</p>
<p>Therefore you should have reverence for what has become, so that the law of love may become redemption through the restoration of the lower and of the past, not perdition through the boundless mastery of the dead. But the spirits of those who die before their time will live, for the sake of our present incompleteness, in dark hordes in the rafters of our houses and besiege our ears with urgent laments, until we grant them redemption through restoring what has existed since ancient times under the rule of love.</p>
<p>What we call temptation is the demand of the dead who passed away prematurely and incomplete through the guilt of the good and of the law. For no good is so complete that it could not do injustice and break what should not be broken.</p>
<p>We are a blinded race. We live only on the surface, only in the present, and think only of tomorrow. We deal roughly with the past in that we do not accept the dead. We want to work only with visible success. Above all we want to be paid. We would consider it insane to do hidden work that does not visibly serve men. There is no doubt that the necessity of life forced us to prefer only those fruits one can taste. But who suffers more from the tempting and misleading influence of the dead than those who have gone wholly missing on the surface of the world?</p>
<p>There is one necessary but hidden and strange work—a major work—which you must do in secret, for the sake of the dead. He who cannot attain his own visible field and vineyard is held fast by the dead, who demand the work of atonement from him. And until he has fulfilled this, he cannot get to his outer work, since the dead do not let him. He shall have to search his soul and act in stillness at their behest and complete the mystery, so that the dead will not let him. Do not look forward so much, but back and into yourself, so that you will not fail to hear the dead.</p>
<p>It belongs to the way of Christ that he ascends with few of the living, but many of the dead. His work was the salvation of the despised and lost, for whose sake he was crucified between two criminals.</p>
<p>I suffer my agony between two madmen. I enter the truth if I descend. Become accustomed to being alone with the dead. It is difficult, but this is precisely how you will discover the worth of your living companions.</p>
<p>What the ancients did for their dead! You seem to believe that you can absolve yourself from the care of the dead, and from the work that they so greatly demand, since what is dead is past. You excuse yourself with your disbelief in the immortality of the soul. Do you think that the dead do not exist because you have devised the impossibility of immortality? You believe in your idols of words. The dead produce effects, that is sufficient. In the inner world there is no explaining away, as little as you can explain away the sea in the outer world. You must finally understand your purpose in explaining away, namely to seek protection.189</p>
<p>I accepted the chaos, and in the following night, my soul approached me. 106/108 [Image 107] 107/108</p>
<p>Nox tertia190</p>
<p>Cap. xvi.</p>
<p>[HI 108] 191My soul spoke to me in a whisper, urgently and alarmingly: “Words, words, do not make too many words. Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness? Do you not want to recognize your madness and welcome it in a friendly manner? You wanted to accept everything. So accept madness too. Let the light of your madness shine, and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life.”</p>
<p>I: “Your words sound hard and the task you set me is difficult.”</p>
<p>S: “If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great part of your nature.”</p>
<p>I: “I didn’t know that this is so.”</p>
<p>S: “Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid becoming its victim. Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That is its mystery and its unknown law. What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life.”</p>
<p>I: “That all sounds very desolate, but nevertheless it prompts me to disagree.”</p>
<p>S: “You have nothing to disagree with—you are in the madhouse.”</p>
<p>There stands the fat little professor—had he spoken this way? And had I taken him for my soul?</p>
<p>Prof: “Yes, my dear, you are confused. Your speech is completely incoherent.”</p>
<p>I: “I too believe that I’ve completely lost myself. Am I really crazy? It’s all terribly confusing.”</p>
<p>Prof: “Have patience, everything will work out. Anyway, sleep well.”</p>
<p>I: “Thank you, but I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>Everything inside me is in utter disarray. Matters are becoming serious, and chaos is approaching. Is this the ultimate bottom? Is chaos also a foundation? If only there weren’t these terrible waves. Everything breaks asunder like black billows. Yes, I see and understand: it is the ocean, the almighty nocturnal tide—a ship moves there—a large steamer—I’m just about to enter the smoking parlor—many people—beautiful clothes—they all look at me astonished—someone comes up to me and says: “What’s the matter? You look just like a ghost! What happened?”</p>
<p>I: “Nothing—that is—I believe that I have gone crazy—the floor sways—everything moves—”</p>
<p>Someone: “The sea is somewhat rough this evening, that’s all—have a hot toddy—you’re seasick.”</p>
<p>I: “You’re right, I am seasick, but in a special way—I’m really in a madhouse.”</p>
<p>Someone: “Well now, you’re joking again, life is returning.”</p>
<p>I: “Do you call that wit? Just now the professor pronounced me truly and utterly mad.”</p>
<p>The fat little professor is actually sitting at a green-covered table playing cards. He turns toward me when he hears me speak and laughs: “Well, where did you get to? Come here. Would you like a drink too? You’re quite a character, I must say. You’ve put all the ladies in quite a flurry this evening.”</p>
<p>I: “Professor, for me this is no longer a joke. Just now I was your patient—”</p>
<p>The parlor erupts in unbridled laughter.</p>
<p>Prof: “I hope that I haven’t upset you too much.”</p>
<p>I: “Well, to be committed is no small matter.”</p>
<p>The person to whom I had been speaking before suddenly comes up to me and looks me in the face. He is a man with a black beard, a tousled head of hair, and dark shining eyes. He speaks to me vehemently: “Something worse happened to me, it’s five years now that I’ve been here.”</p>
<p>I realize that it is my neighbor, who has apparently awakened from his apathy and is now sitting on my bed. He goes on speaking fiercely and urgently: “But I am Nietzsche, only rebaptized, I am also Christ, the Savior, and appointed to save the world, but they won’t let me.”</p>
<p>I: “Who won’t let you?”</p>
<p>The fool: “The devil. We are in Hell. But of course, you haven’t noticed it yet. I didn’t realize until the second year of my time here that the director is the devil.”</p>
<p>I: “You mean the professor? That sounds incredible.”</p>
<p>The fool: “You’re an ignoramus. I was supposed to marry the mother of God long ago.192 But the professor, that devil, has her in his power. Every evening when the sun goes down he gets her with child. In the morning before sunrise she gives birth to it. Then all the devils come together and kill the child in a gruesome 108/110 [Image 109]193 109/110 manner. I distinctly hear his cries.”</p>
<p>I: “But what you have told me is pure mythology.”</p>
<p>The fool: “You’re crazy and understand nothing of it. You belong in the madhouse. My God, why does my family always shut me in with crazy people? I’m supposed to save the world, I’m the Savior!”</p>
<p>He lies down again and sinks back into his lassitude. I clutch the sides of my bed to protect myself against the terrible waves. I stare at the wall, so that I can at least latch onto something with my eyes. A horizontal line runs along the wall, which is painted a darker color beneath. A radiator stands in front of it—it is a railing and I can see the sea beyond it. The line is the horizon. And there the sun now rises in red glory, solitary and magnificent—in it is a cross from which a serpent hangs—or is it a bull, slit open, as at the slaughterhouse, or is it an ass? I suppose it is really a ram with a crown of thorns—or is it the crucified one, myself? The sun of martyrdom has arisen and is pouring bloody rays over the sea. This spectacle lasts a long time, the sun rises higher, its rays grow brighter194 and hotter and the sun burns down white on a blue sea. The swell has subsided. A charitable and quiet summer dawn lies on the shimmering sea. The salty smell of water rises up. A faint wide surf breaks on the sand with a dull thunder, and returns incessantly, twelve times, the strokes of the world clock195—the twelfth hour is complete. And now silence enters. No noise, no breeze. Everything is rigid and deathly still. I wait, secretly anxious. I see a tree arise from the sea. Its crown reaches to Heaven and its roots reach down into Hell. I am completely alone and disheartened and gaze from afar. It is as if all life had flown from me and completely passed into the incomprehensible and fearful. I am utterly weak and incapable. “Salvation,” I whisper. A strange voice speaks: “There is no salvation here,196 you must remain calm, or you will disturb the others. It is night and the other people want to sleep.” I see, it’s the attendant. The room is dimly lit by a weak lamp and sadness weighs on the room.</p>
<p>I: “I couldn’t find the way.”</p>
<p>He says: “You don’t need to find a way now.”</p>
<p>He speaks the truth. The way, or whatever it might be, on which people go, is our way, the right way. There are no paved ways into the future. We say that it is this way, and it is. We build roads by going on. Our life is the truth that we seek. Only my life is the truth, the truth above all. We create the truth by living it.</p>
<p>[2] This is the night in which all the dams broke, where what was previously solid moved, where the stones turned into serpents, and everything living froze. Is this a web of words? If it is, it is a hellish web for those caught in it.</p>
<p>There are hellish webs of words, only words, but what are words? Be tentative with words, value them well, take safe words, words without catches, do not spin them with one another so that no webs arise, for you are the first who is ensnared in them.197 For words have meanings. With words you pull up the underworld. Word, the paltriest and the mightiest. In words the emptiness and the fullness flow together. Hence the word is an image of God. The word is the greatest and the smallest that man created, just as what is created through man is the greatest and the smallest.</p>
<p>So if I fall prey to the web of words, I fall prey to the greatest and the smallest. I am at the mercy of the sea, of the inchoate waves that are forever changing place. Their essence is movement and movement is their order. He who strives against waves is exposed to the arbitrary. The work of men is steady but it swims upon chaos. The striving of men seems like lunacy to him who comes from the sea. But men consider him mad.198 He who comes from the sea is sick. He can hardly bear the gaze of men. For to him they all seem to be drunk and foolish from sleep-inducing poisons. They want to come to your rescue, and as for accepting help, for sure you would like less of that, rather than swindling your way into their company and being completely like one who has never seen the chaos but only talks about it.</p>
<p>But for him who has seen the chaos, there is no more hiding, because he knows that the bottom sways and knows what this swaying means. He has seen the order and the disorder of the endless, he knows the unlawful laws. He knows the sea and can never forget it. The chaos is terrible: days full of lead, nights full of horror.</p>
<p>But just as Christ knew that he was the way, the truth, and the life, in that the new torment and the renewed salvation came into the world through him,199 I know that chaos must come over men, and that the hands of those who unknowingly and unsuspectingly break through the thin walls that separate us from the sea are busy. For this is our way, our truth, and our life.</p>
<p>Just as the disciples of Christ recognized that God had become flesh and lived among them as a man, we now recognize that the anointed of this time is a God who does not appear in the flesh; he is no man and yet is a son of man, but in spirit and not in flesh; hence he can be born only through the spirit of men as the conceiving womb of the God.200 What is done to this God you do to the lowest in yourself, under the law of love according to which nothing is cast out. For how else should your lowest be saved from depravity? 110/112 [Image 111]201 111/112 Who should accept the lowest in you, if you do not? But he who does it not from love but from pride, selfishness, and greed, is damned. None of the damnation is cast out either.202</p>
<p>If you accept the lowest in you, suffering is unavoidable, since you do the base thing and build up what lay in ruin. There are many graves and corpses in us, an evil stench of decomposition.203 Just as Christ through the torment of sanctification subjugated the flesh, so the God of this time through the torment of sanctification will subjugate the spirit. Just as Christ tormented the flesh through the spirit, the God of this time will torment the spirit through the flesh. For our spirit has become an impertinent whore, a slave to words created by men and no longer the divine word itself.204</p>
<p>The lowest in you is the source of mercy. We take this sickness upon ourselves, the inability to find peace, the baseness, and the contemptibility so that the God can be healed and radiantly ascend, purged of the decomposition of death and the mud of the underworld. The despicable prisoner will ascend to his salvation shining and wholly healed.205</p>
<p>Is there a suffering that would be too great to want to undergo for our God? You only see the one, and do not notice the other. But when there is one, so there is also another and that is the lowest in you. But the lowest in you is also the eye of the evil that stares at you and looks at you coldly and sucks your light down into the dark abyss. Bless the hand that keeps you up there, the smallest humanity, the lowest living thing. Quite a few would prefer death. Since Christ imposed bloody sacrifice on humanity, the renewed God will also not spare bloodshed.</p>
<p>Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? I have trodden the winepress alone and no one is with me. I have trodden myself down in my anger, and trampled upon myself in my fury. Hence my blood has spattered my clothes, and I have stained my robe. For I have afforded myself a day of vengeance, and the year to redeem myself has come. And I looked around, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was no one who stood by me: therefore my own arm must save me, and my fury upheld me. And I trod myself down in my rage, and made myself drunk in my fury, and spilt my blood on the earth.206 For I took my misdeed upon myself so that the God would be healed.</p>
<p>Just as Christ said that he did not come to make peace but brought the sword,207 so he in whom Christ becomes complete will not give himself peace, but a sword. He will rebel against himself and one will be turned against the other in him. He will also hate that which he loves in himself. He will be castigated in himself, mocked, and given over to the torment of crucifixion, and no one will aid him or soothe his torment.</p>
<p>Just as Christ was crucified between the two thieves, our lowest lies on either side of our way. And just as one thief went to Hell and the other rose up to Heaven, the lowest in us will be sundered in two halves on the day of our judgment. The one is destined for damnation and death, and the other will rise up.208 But it will take a long time until you see what is destined for death and what is destined for life, since the lowest in you is still unseparated and one, and in a deep sleep.</p>
<p>If I accept the lowest in me, I lower a seed into the ground of Hell. The seed is invisibly small, but the tree of my life grows from it and conjoins the Below with the Above. At both ends there is fire and blazing embers. The Above is fiery and the Below is fiery. Between the unbearable fires grows your life. You hang between these two poles. In an immeasurably frightening movement the stretched hanging welters up and down.209</p>
<p>We thus fear our lowest, since that which one does not possess is forever united with the chaos and takes part in its mysterious ebb and flow. Insofar as I accept the lowest in me—precisely that red glowing sun of the depths—and thus fall victim to the confusion of chaos, the upper shining sun also rises. Therefore he who strives for the highest finds the deepest.</p>
<p>To deliver the men of his time from the stretched hanging, Christ effectively took this torment upon himself and taught them: “Be crafty like serpents and guileless like doves.”210 For craftiness counsels against chaos, and guilelessness veils its terrible aspect. Thus men could take the safe middle path, hedged both upward and downward.</p>
<p>But the dead of the Above and the Below mounted, and their demands grew ever louder. And both the noble and the wicked rose up again and, unaware, broke the law of the mediator. They flung open doors both above and below. They drew many after them to higher and lower madness, thereby sowing confusion and preparing the way of what is to come.</p>
<p>But he who goes into the one and not also at the same time into the other by accepting what comes toward him, will simply teach and live the one and turn it into a reality. For he will be its victim. When you go into the one and hence consider the other approaching you as your enemy, you will fight against the other. You will do so because you fail to recognize that the other is also in you. On the contrary, you think that the other comes somehow from without and you think that you also catch sight of it in the views and actions of your fellow men which clash with yours. You thus fight the other and are completely blinded.</p>
<p>But he who accepts what approaches him because it is also in him, quarrels and wrangles no more, but looks into himself and keeps silent. 112/114 [Image 113]211 113/114</p>
<p>He sees the tree of life, whose roots reach into Hell and whose top touches Heaven. He also no longer knows differences:212 who is right? What is holy? What is genuine? What is good? What is correct? He knows only one difference: the difference between below and above. For he sees that the tree of life grows from below to above, and that it has its crown at the top, clearly differentiated from the roots. To him this is unquestionable. Hence he knows the way to salvation.</p>
<p>To unlearn all distinctions save that concerning direction is part of your salvation. Hence you free yourself from the old curse of the knowledge of good and evil. Because you separated good from evil according to your best appraisal and aspired only to the good and denied the evil that you committed nevertheless and failed to accept, your roots no longer suckled the dark nourishment of the depths and your tree became sick and withered.</p>
<p>Therefore the ancients said that after Adam had eaten the apple, the tree of paradise withered.213 Your life needs the dark. But if you know that it is evil, you can no longer accept it and you suffer anguish and you do not know why. Nor can you accept it as evil, else your good will reject you. Nor can you deny it since you know good and evil. Because of this the knowledge of good and evil was an insurmountable curse.</p>
<p>But if you return to primal chaos and if you feel and recognize that which hangs stretched between the two unbearable poles of fire, you will notice that you can no longer separate good and evil conclusively, neither through feeling nor through knowledge, but that you can discern the direction of growth only from below to above. You thus forget the distinction between good and evil, and you no longer know it as long as your tree grows from below to above. But as soon as growth stops, what was united in growth falls apart and once more you recognize good and evil.</p>
<p>You can never deny your knowledge of good and evil to yourself, so that you could betray your good in order to live evil. For as soon as you separate good and evil, you recognize them. They are united only in growth. But you grow if you stand still in the greatest doubt, and therefore steadfastness in great doubt is a veritable flower of life.</p>
<p>He who cannot bear doubt does not bear himself. Such a one is doubtful; he does not grow and hence he does not live. Doubt is the sign of the strongest and the weakest. The strong have doubt, but doubt has the weak. Therefore the weakest is close to the strongest, and if he can say to his doubt: “I have you,” then he is the strongest.214 But no one can say yes to his doubt, unless he endures wide-open chaos. Because there are so many among us who can talk about anything, pay heed to what they live. What someone says can be very much or very little. Thus examine his life.</p>
<p>My speech is neither light nor dark, since it is the speech of someone who is growing.</p>
<p>Nox quarta215</p>
<p>Cap. xvii</p>
<p>[HI 114] 216I hear the roaring of the morning wind, which comes over the mountains. The night is overcome, when all my life was subject to eternal confusion and stretched out between the poles of fire.</p>
<p>My soul speaks to me in a bright voice: “The door should be lifted off its hinges to provide a free passage between here and there, between yes and no, between above and below, between left and right. Airy passages should be built between all opposed things, light smooth streets should lead from one pole to the other. Scales should be set up, whose pointer sways gently. A flame should burn that cannot be blown out by the wind. A stream should flow to its deepest goal. The herds of wild animals should move to their feeding grounds along their old game paths. Life should proceed, from birth to death, from death to birth, unbroken like the path of the sun. Everything should proceed on this path.”</p>
<p>Thus speaks my soul. But I toy casually and terribly with myself. Is it day or night? Am I asleep or awake? Am I alive or have I already died?</p>
<p>Blind darkness besieges me—a great wall—a gray worm of twilight crawls along it. It has a round face and laughs. The laughter is convulsive and actually relieving. I open my eyes: the fat cook is standing before me: “You’re a sound sleeper, I must say. You’ve slept for more than an hour.”</p>
<p>I: “Really? Have I slept? I must have dreamed, what a dreadful play! Did I fall asleep in this kitchen? Is this really the realm of mothers?”217</p>
<p>“Have a glass of water, you’re still thoroughly drowsy.”</p>
<p>I: ‘Yes, this sleep can make one drunk. Where is my Thomas? There it lies, open at the twenty-first chapter: “My soul, in everything and yet beyond everything, you must find your rest in the Lord, for he is the eternal rest of the saints.”218</p>
<p>I read this sentence aloud. Is not every word followed by a question mark?</p>
<p>“If you fell asleep with this sentence, you must really have had a beautiful dream.”</p>
<p>I: “I certainly dreamed, and I will think about the dream. Incidentally, can you tell me whose cook you are?”</p>
<p>“The librarian’s. He loves good cooking and I have been with him for many years.” 114/116 [Image 115]219 115/116</p>
<p>I: “Oh, I had no idea that the librarian had such a cook.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you must know that he’s a gourmet.”</p>
<p>I: “Farewell, madam cook, and thank you for the accommodation.”</p>
<p>“You are most welcome and the pleasure was entirely mine.”</p>
<p>Now I am outside. So that was the librarian’s cook. Does he really know what food is prepared inside? He has certainly never gone in there for a temple sleep.220 I think that I’ll return the Thomas à Kempis to him. I enter the library.</p>
<p>L: “Good evening, here you are again.”</p>
<p>I: “Good evening, Sir, I’ve come to return the Thomas. I sat down for a bit in your kitchen next door to read, without suspecting that it’s your kitchen.”</p>
<p>L: “Please, there’s no problem whatsoever. Hopefully my cook received you well.”</p>
<p>I: “I can’t complain about the reception. I even had an afternoon sleep over Thomas.”</p>
<p>L: “That doesn’t surprise me. These prayer books are terribly boring.”</p>
<p>I: “Yes, for people like us. But your cook finds the little book very edifying.”</p>
<p>L: “Well yes, for the cook.”</p>
<p>I: “Allow me the indiscrete question: have you ever had an incubation sleep in your kitchen?”</p>
<p>L: “No, I’ve never entertained such a strange idea.”</p>
<p>I: “Let me say that you’d learn a lot that way about the nature of your kitchen. Good night, Sir!”</p>
<p>After this conversation I left the library and went outside into the anteroom where I approached the green curtains. I pushed them aside, and what did I see? I saw a high-ceilinged hall before me—with a supposedly magnificent garden in the background—Klingsor’s magical garden, it occurred to me at once. I had entered a theater; those two over there are part of the play: Amfortas and Kundry, or rather, just what am I looking at? It is the librarian and his cook. He is ailing and pale, and has a bad stomach, she is disappointed and furious. Klingsor is standing to the left, holding the feather the librarian used to tuck behind his ear. How closely Klingsor resembles me! What a repulsive play! But look, Parsifal enters from the left. How strange, he also looks like me. Klingsor venomously throws the feather at Parsifal. But the latter catches it calmly.</p>
<p>The scene changes: It appears that the audience, in this case me, joins in during the last act. One must kneel down as the Good Friday service begins: Parsifal enters—slowly, his head covered with a black helmet. The lionskin of Hercules adorns his shoulders and he holds the club in his hand; he is also wearing modern black trousers in honor of the church holiday. I bristle and stretch out my hand avertingly, but the play goes on. Parsifal takes off his helmet. Yet there is no Gurnemanz to atone for and consecrate him. Kundry stands in the distance, covering her head and laughing. The audience is enraptured and recognizes itself in Parsifal. He is I. I take off my armor layered with history and my chimerical decoration and go to the spring wearing a white penitent’s shirt, where I wash my feet and hands without the help of a stranger. Then I also take off my penitent’s shirt and put on my civilian clothes. I walk out of the scene and approach myself—I who am still kneeling down in prayer as the audience. I rise and become one with myself.221</p>
<p>[2] What would mockery be, if it were not true mockery? What would doubt be, if it were not true doubt? What would opposition be, it if were not true opposition? He who wants to accept himself must also really accept his other. But in the yes not every no is true, and in the no every yes is a lie. But since I can be in the yes today and in the no tomorrow, yes and no are both true and untrue. Whereas yes and no cannot yield because they exist, our concepts of truth and error can.</p>
<p>I presume you would like to have certainty with regard to truth and error? Certainty within one or the other is not only possible, but also necessary, although certainty in one is protection and resistance against the other. If you are in one, your certainty about the one excludes the other. But how can you then reach the other? And why can the one not be enough for us? One cannot be enough for us since the other is in us. And if we were content with one, the other would suffer great need and afflict us with its hunger. But we misunderstand this hunger and still believe that we are hungry for the one and strive for it even more adamantly.</p>
<p>Through this we cause the other in us to assert its demands on us even more strongly. If we are then ready to recognize the claim of the other in us, we can cross over into the other to satisfy it. But we can thus reach across, since the other has become conscious to us. Yet if our blinding through the one is strong, we become even more distant from the other, and a disastrous chasm between the one and the other opens up in us. The one becomes surfeited and the other becomes too hungry. The satiated grows lazy and the hungry grows weak. And so we suffocate in fat, consumed by lack.</p>
<p>This is sickness, but you see a lot of this type. It must be so, but it need not be so. There are grounds and causes enough that it is so, but we also want it not 116/117 to be so. For man is afforded the freedom to overcome the cause, for he is creative in and of himself. If you have reached that freedom through the suffering of your spirit to accept the other despite your highest belief in the one, since you are it too, then your growth begins.</p>
<p>If others mock me, it is nevertheless them doing this, and I can attribute guilt to them for this, and forget to mock myself. But he who cannot mock himself will be mocked by others. So accept your self-mockery so that everything divine and heroic falls from you and you become completely human. What is divine and heroic in you is a mockery to the other in you. For the sake of the other in you, set off your admired role which you previously performed for your own self and become who you are.</p>
<p>He who has the luck and misfortune of a particular talent falls prey to believing that he is this gift. Hence he is also often its fool. A special gift is something outside of me. I am not the same as it. The nature of the gift has nothing to do with the nature of the man who carries it. It often even lives at the expense of the bearer’s character. His character is marked by the disadvantage of his gift, indeed even through its opposite. Consequently he is never at the height of his gift but always beneath it. If he accepts his other he becomes capable of bearing his gift without disadvantage. But if he only wants to live in his gift and consequently rejects his other, he oversteps the mark, since the essence of his gift is extrahuman and a natural phenomenon, which he in reality is not. All the world sees his error, and he becomes the victim of its mockery. Then he says that others mock him, while it is only the disregard of his other that makes him ridiculous.</p>
<p>When the God enters my life, I return to my poverty for the sake of the God. I accept the burden of poverty and bear all my ugliness and ridiculousness, and also everything reprehensible in me. I thus relieve the God of all the confusion and absurdity that would befall him if I did not accept it. With this I prepare the way for the God’s doing. What should happen? Has the darkest abyss been emptied and exhausted? Or what stands and waits down there, impending and red-hot? [Image 117]222</p>
<p>117/118 Which fire has not been put out and which embers are still ablaze? We sacrificed innumerable victims to the dark depths, and yet it still demands more. What is this crazy desire craving satisfaction? Whose mad cries are these? Who among the dead suffers thus? Come here and drink blood, so that you can speak.223 Why do you reject the blood? Would you like milk? Or the red juice of the vine? Perhaps you would rather have love? Love for the dead? Being in love with the dead? Are you perhaps demanding the seeds of life for the faded thousand-year-old body of the underworld? An unchaste incestuous lust for the dead? Something that makes the blood run cold. Are you demanding a lusty commingling with corpses? I spoke of “acceptance” —but you demand “to seize, embrace, copulate?” Are you demanding the desecration of the dead? That prophet, you say, lay on the child, and placed his mouth on the child’s mouth, and his eyes on its eyes, and his hands on its hands and he thus splays himself over the boy, so that the child’s body became warm. But he rose again and went here and there in the house before he mounted anew and spread himself over him again. The boy snorted seven times. Then the boy opened his eyes. So shall your acceptance be, so shall you accept, not cool, not superior, not thought out, not obsequious, not as a self-chastisement, but with pleasure, precisely with this ambiguous impure pleasure, whose ambiguity enables it to unite with the higher, with that holy-evil pleasure of which you do not know whether it be virtue or vice, with that pleasure which is lusty repulsiveness, lecherous fear, sexual immaturity. One wakens the dead with this pleasure.</p>
<p>Your lowest is in a sleep resembling death and needs the warmth of life which contains good and evil inseparably and indistinguishably. That is the way of life; you can call it neither evil nor good, neither pure nor impure. Yet this is not the goal, but the way and the crossing. It is also sickness and the beginning of recovery. It is the mother of all abominable deeds and all salutary symbols. It is the most primordial form of creation, the very first dark urge that flows through all secret hiding places and dark passages, with the unintentional lawfulness of water and from unexpected places in the loose soil, swelling from the finest cracks to fructify the dry soil. It is the very first, secret teacher of nature, teaching plants and animals the most astonishing and supremely clever skills and tricks, which we hardly know how to fathom. It is the great sage who has superhuman knowledge, who has the greatest of all the sciences, who makes order out of confusion, and who prophesies the future clairvoyantly out of ungraspable fullness. It is the serpentlike, perishable and beneficial, the dreadfully and ridiculously daimonic. It is the arrow that always hits the weakest spot, the spring root which opens the sealed treasure chambers.</p>
<p>You can call it neither clever nor stupid, neither good nor evil, since its nature is inhuman throughout. It is the son of the earth, the dark one whom you should awaken.224 It is man and woman at the same time and immature sex, rich in interpretation and misinterpretation, so poor in meaning and yet so rich. This is the dead that cried loudest, that stood right at the bottom and waited, that suffered worst. It desired neither blood nor milk nor wine for the sacrifice of the dead, but the willingness of our flesh. Its longing paid no heed to the torment of our spirit which struggled and tortured itself to devise what cannot be devised, that hence tore itself apart and sacrificed itself. Not until our spirit lay dismembered on the altar did I hear the voice of the son of the earth, and only then did I see that he was the great suffering one, who needed salvation. He is the chosen one since he was the most rejected. It is bad to have to say this, but perhaps I hear badly, or perhaps I misunderstand what the depths say. It is miserable to say as much, and yet I must say it.</p>
<p>The depths are silent. He has arisen and now beholds the light of the sun and is among the living. Restlessness and discord rose up with him, doubt and the fullness of life.</p>
<p>Amen, it is finished. What was unreal is real, what was real is unreal. However, I may not, I do not want to, I cannot. Oh human wretchedness! Oh unwillingness in us! Oh doubt and despair. This is really Good Friday, upon which the Lord died and descended into Hell and completed the mysteries.225 This is the Good Friday when we complete the Christ in us and we descend to Hell ourselves. This the Good Friday on which we moan and cry to will the completion of Christ, for after his completion we go to Hell. Christ was so powerful that his realm covered all the world and only Hell lay outside it.</p>
<p>Who succeeded in crossing the borders of this realm with good grounds, pure conscience, and obeying the law of love? Who among the living is Christ and journeys to Hell in living flesh? Who is it that expands the realm of Christ with Hell? Who is it that is full of drunkenness while sober? Who is it that descended from being one into being two? Who is it that tore apart his own heart to unite what has been separated?</p>
<p>I am he, the nameless one, who does not know himself and whose name is concealed even from himself. I have no name, since I have not yet existed, but have only just become. To myself I am an Anabaptist and a stranger. I, who I am, am not it. But I, who will be I before me and after me, am it. In that I abased myself, I elevated myself as another. In that I accepted myself, I divided myself into two, and in that I united myself with myself, I became the smaller part of myself. I am this in my consciousness. However, I am thus in my consciousness as if I were also separated from it. I am 118/120 [Image 119]226 119/120 not in my second and greater state, as if I were this second and greater one myself, but I am always in ordinary consciousness, yet so separate and distinct from it, as if I were in my second and greater state, but without the consciousness of really being it. I have even become smaller and poorer, but precisely because of my smallness I can be conscious of the nearness of the great.</p>
<p><em>I have been baptized with impure water for rebirth. A flame from the fire of Hell awaited me above the baptismal basin. I have bathed myself with impurity and I have cleansed myself with dirt. I received him, I accepted him, the divine brother, the son of the earth, the two-sexed and impure, and overnight he has become a man. His two incisors have broken through and light down covers his chin. I captured him, I overcame him, I embraced him. He demanded much from me and yet brought everything with him. For he is rich; the earth belongs to him. But his black horse has parted from him.</em></p>
<p>Truly, I have shot down a proud enemy, I have forced a greater and stronger one to be my friend. Nothing should separate me from him, the dark one. If I want to leave him, he follows me like my shadow. If I do not think of him, he is still uncannily near. He will turn into fear if I deny him. I must amply commemorate him, I must prepare a sacrificial meal for him. I fill a plate for him at my table. Much that I would have done earlier for men, I now must do for him. Hence they consider me selfish, for they do not know that I go with my friend, and that many days are consecrated to him.227 But unrest has moved in, a quiet underground earthquake, a distant great roaring. Ways have been opened to the primordial and to the future. Miracles and terrible mysteries are close at hand. I feel the things that were and that will be. Behind the ordinary the eternal abyss yawns. The earth gives me back what it hid. 120/123 [Image 121]228, 229, 230 121/123 [Image 122]231, 232 122/123 [Image 123]233 123/124</p>
<p>The Three Prophecies</p>
<p>Cap. xviii</p>
<p>[HI 124]234 Wondrous things came nearer. I called my soul and asked her to dive down into the floods, whose distant roaring I could hear. This happened on 22 January of the year 1914, as recorded in my black book. And thus she plunged into the darkness like a shot, and from the depths she called out: “Will you accept what I bring?”</p>
<p>I: “ ‘I will accept what you give. I do not have the right to judge or to reject.”</p>
<p>S: “So listen. There is old armor and the rusty gear of our fathers down here, murderous leather trappings hanging from them, worm-eaten lance shafts, twisted spear heads, broken arrows, rotten shields, skulls, the bones of man and horse, old cannons, catapults, crumbling firebrands, smashed assault gear, stone spearheads, stone clubs, sharp bones, chipped arrowhead teeth—everything the battles of yore have littered the earth with. Will you accept all this?”</p>
<p>I: “I accept it. You know better, my soul.”</p>
<p>S: “I find painted stones, carved bones with magical signs, talismanic sayings on hanks of leather and small plates of lead, dirty pouches filled with teeth, human hair and fingernails, timbers lashed together, black orbs, moldy animal skins—all the superstitions hatched by dark prehistory. Will you accept all this?”</p>
<p>I: “I accept it all, how should I dismiss anything?”</p>
<p>S: “But I find worse: fratricide, cowardly mortal blows, torture, child sacrifice, the annihilation of whole peoples, arson, betrayal, war, rebellion—will you also accept this?”</p>
<p>I: “Also this, if it must be. How can I judge?”</p>
<p>S: “I find epidemics, natural catastrophes, sunken ships, razed cities, frightful feral savagery, famines, human meanness, and fear, whole mountains of fear.”</p>
<p>I: “So shall it be, since you give it.”</p>
<p>S: “I find the treasures of all past cultures, magnificent images of Gods, spacious temples, paintings, papyrus rolls, sheets of parchment with the characters of bygone languages, books full of lost wisdom, hymns and chants of ancient priests, stories told down the ages through thousands of generations.”</p>
<p>I: “That is an entire world—whose extent I cannot grasp. How can I accept it?”</p>
<p>S: “But you wanted to accept everything? You do not know your limits. Can you not limit yourself?”</p>
<p>I: “I must limit myself. Who could ever grasp such wealth?”</p>
<p>S: “Be content and cultivate your garden with modesty.”235</p>
<p>I: “I will. I see that it is not worth conquering a larger piece of the immeasurable, but a smaller one instead. A well-tended small garden is better than an ill-tended large garden. Both gardens are equally small when faced with the immeasurable, but unequally cared for.”</p>
<p>S: “Take shears and prune your trees.”</p>
<p>[2] From the flooding darkness the son of the earth had brought, my soul gave me ancient things that pointed to the future. She gave me three things: The misery of war, the darkness of magic, and the gift of religion.</p>
<p>If you are clever, you will understand that these three things belong together. These three mean the unleashing of chaos and its power, just as they also mean the binding of chaos. War is obvious and everybody sees it. Magic is dark and no one sees it. Religion is still to come, but it will become evident. Did you think that the horrors of such atrocious warfare would come over us? Did you think that magic existed? Did you think about a new religion? I sat up for long nights and looked ahead at what was to come and I shuddered. Do you believe me? I am not too concerned. What should I believe? What should I disbelieve? I saw and I shuddered.</p>
<p>But my spirit could not grasp the monstrous, and could not conceive the extent of what was to come. The force of my longing languished, and powerless sank the harvesting hands. I felt the burden of the most terrible work of the times ahead. I saw where and how, but no word can grasp it, no will can conquer it. I could not do otherwise, I let it sink again into the depths.</p>
<p>I cannot give it to you, and I can speak only of the way of what is to come. Little good will come to you from outside. What will come to you lies within yourself. But what lies there! I would like to avert my eyes, close my ears and deny all my senses; I would like to be someone among you, who knows nothing and who never saw anything. It is too much and too unexpected. But I saw it and my memory will not leave me alone.236 Yet I curtail my longing, which would like to stretch out into the future, and I return to my small garden that presently blooms, and whose extent I can measure. It shall be well-tended.</p>
<p>The future should be left to those of the future. I return to the small and the real, for this is the great way, the way of what is to come. I return to my simple reality, to my undeniable and most minuscule being. And I take a knife and hold court over everything that has grown without measure and goal. Forests have grown around me, winding plants have climbed up me, and I am completely covered by endless proliferation. The depths are inexhaustible, they give everything. Everything is as good as nothing. Keep a little and you have something. To recognize and know your ambition and your greed, to gather 124/126 [Image 125]237 125/126 your craving, to cultivate it, grasp it, make it serviceable, influence it, master it, order it, to give it interpretations and meanings, is extravagant.</p>
<p>It is lunacy, like everything that transcends its boundaries. How can you hold that which you are not? Would you really like to force everything which you are not under the yoke of your wretched knowledge and understanding? Remember that you can know yourself, and with that you know enough. But you cannot know others and everything else. Beware of knowing what lies beyond yourself, or else your presumed knowledge will suffocate the life of those who know themselves. A knower may know himself. That is his limit.</p>
<p>With a painful slice I cut off what I pretended to know about what lies beyond me. I excise myself from the cunning interpretive loops that I gave to what lies beyond me. And my knife cuts even deeper and separates me from the meanings that I conferred upon myself. I cut down to the marrow, until everything meaningful falls from me, until I am no longer as I might seem to myself, until I know only that I am without knowing what I am.</p>
<p>I want to be poor and bare, and I want to stand naked before the inexorable. I want to be my body and its poverty. I want to be from the earth and live its law. I want to be my human animal and accept all its frights and desires. I want to go through the wailing and the blessedness of the one who stood alone with a poor unarmed body on the sunlit earth, a prey of his drives and of the lurking wild animals, who was terrified by ghosts and dreaming of distant Gods, who belonged to what was near and was enemy to the far-off, who struck fire from stones, and whose herds were stolen by unknowable powers that also destroyed the crops of his fields, and who neither knew nor recognized, but who lived by what lay at hand, and received by grace what lay far-off.</p>
<p>He was a child and unsure, yet full of certainty, weak and yet blessed with enormous strength. When his God did not help, he took another. And when this one did not help either, he castigated him. And behold: the Gods helped one more time. Thus I discard everything that was laden with meaning, everything divine and devilish with which chaos burdened me. Truly, it is not up to me to prove the Gods and the devils and the chaotic monsters, to feed them carefully, to warily drag them with me, to count and name them, and to protect them with belief against disbelief and doubt.</p>
<p>A free man knows only free Gods and devils that are self-contained and take effect on account of their own force. If they fail to have an effect, that is their own business, and I can remove this burden from myself. But if they are effective, they need neither my protection nor my care, nor my belief. Thus you may wait quietly to see whether they work. But if they do, be clever, for the tiger is stronger than you. You should be able to cast everything from you, otherwise you are a slave, even if you are the slave of a God. Life is free and chooses its way. It is limited enough, so do not pile up more limitation. Hence I cut away everything confining. I stood here, and there lay the riddlesome multifariousness of the world.</p>
<p>And a horror crept over me. Am I not the tightly bound? Is the world there not the unlimited? And I became aware of my weakness. What would poverty, nakedness and unpreparedness be without consciousness of weakness and without horror at powerlessness? Thus I stood and was terrified. And then my soul whispered to me:</p>
<p>The Gift of Magic</p>
<p>Cap. xix.</p>
<p>[HI 126]238 “Do you not hear something?”</p>
<p>I: “I’m not aware of anything, what should I hear?”</p>
<p>S: “A ringing.”</p>
<p>I: “A ringing? What? I hear nothing.”</p>
<p>S: “Listen harder.”</p>
<p>I: “Perhaps something in the left ear. What could it mean?”</p>
<p>S: “Misfortune.”</p>
<p>I: “I accept what you say. I want to have fortune and misfortune.”</p>
<p>S: “Well, then, raise your hands and receive what comes to you.”</p>
<p>I: “What is it? A rod? A black serpent? A black rod, formed like a serpent—with two pearls as eyes—a gold bangle around its neck. Is it not like a magical rod?”</p>
<p>S: “It is a magical rod.”</p>
<p>I: “What should I do with magic? Is the magical rod a misfortune? Is magic a misfortune?”</p>
<p>S: “Yes, for those who possess it.”</p>
<p>I: “That sounds like the sayings of old—how strange you are, my soul! What should I do with magic?”</p>
<p>S: “Magic will do a lot for you.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m afraid that you’re stirring up my desire and misunderstanding. You know that man never stops craving the black art and things that cost no effort.”</p>
<p>S: “Magic is not easy, and it demands sacrifice.”</p>
<p>I: “Does it demand the sacrifice of love? Of humanity? If it does, take the rod back.”</p>
<p>S: “Don’t be rash. Magic doesn’t demand that sacrifice. It demands another sacrifice.”</p>
<p>I: “What sacrifice is that?”</p>
<p>S: “The sacrifice that magic demands is solace.”</p>
<p>I: “Solace? Do I understand correctly? Understanding you is unspeakably difficult. Tell me, what does this mean?”</p>
<p>S: “Solace is to be sacrificed.”</p>
<p>I: “What do you mean? Should the solace that I give or the solace that I receive be sacrificed?”</p>
<p>S: “Both.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m confused. This is too dark.”</p>
<p>S: “You must sacrifice solace for the sake of the black rod, the solace you give and the solace you receive.”</p>
<p>I: “Are you saying that I shouldn’t be allowed to receive the solace of those I love? And should give no solace to those I love? This means the loss of a piece of humanity, and what one calls severity toward oneself and others takes its place.”239</p>
<p>S: “That is how it is.”</p>
<p>I: “Does the rod demand this sacrifice?”</p>
<p>S: “It demands this sacrifice.”</p>
<p>I: “Can I, am I allowed to make this sacrifice for the sake of the rod? Must I accept the rod?”</p>
<p>S: “Do you want to or not?”</p>
<p>I: “I can’t say. What do I know about the black rod? Who gives it to me?”</p>
<p>S: “The darkness that lies before you. It is the next thing that comes to you. Will you accept it and offer it your sacrifice?”</p>
<p>I: It is hard to sacrifice to the dark, to the blind darkness—and what a sacrifice!”</p>
<p>S: “Nature—does nature offer solace? Does it accept solace?”</p>
<p>I: “You venture a heavy word. What solitude are you asking of me?”</p>
<p>S: “This is your misfortune, and—the power of the black rod.”</p>
<p>I: “How gloomily and full of foreboding you speak! Are you sheathing me in the armor 126/128 [Image 127]240 127/128 of icy severity? Are you clasping my heart with a bronze carapace? I’m happy with the warmth of life. Should I miss it? For the sake of magic? What is magic?”</p>
<p>S: “You don’t know magic. So don’t judge. What are you bristling at?”</p>
<p>I: “Magic! What should I do with magic? I don’t believe in it, I can’t believe in it. My heart sinks—and I’m supposed to sacrifice a greater part of my humanity to magic?”</p>
<p>S: “I advise you, don’t struggle against this, and above all don’t act so enlightened, as if deep down you did not believe in magic.”</p>
<p>I: “You’re inexorable. But I can’t believe in magic, or maybe I have a completely false idea of it.”</p>
<p>S: “Yes, I gather that from what you’re saying. Cast aside your blind judgment and critical gesture, otherwise you’ll never understand. Do you still mean to waste years waiting?”</p>
<p>I: “Be patient, my science has not yet been overcome.”</p>
<p>S: “High time that you overcame it!”</p>
<p>I: “You ask a great deal, almost too much. After all—is science essential to life? Is science life? There are people who live without science. But to overcome science for the sake of magic? That’s uncanny and menacing.”</p>
<p>S: “Are you afraid? Don’t you want to risk life? Isn’t it life that presents you with this problem?”</p>
<p>I: “All this leaves me so dazed and confused. Won’t you give me an enlightening word?”</p>
<p>S: “Oh, so it’s solace you long for? Do you want the rod or don’t you?”</p>
<p>I: “You tear my heart to pieces. I want to submit to life. But how difficult this is! I want the black rod because it is the first thing the darkness grants me. I don’t know what this rod means, nor what it gives—I only feel what it takes. I want to kneel down and receive this messenger of darkness. I have received the black rod, and now I hold it, the enigmatic one, in my hand; it is cold and heavy, like iron. The pearl eyes of the serpent look at me blindly and dazzlingly. What do you want, mysterious gift? All the darkness of all former worlds crowds together in you, you hard, black piece of steel! Are you time and fate? The essence of nature, hard and eternally inconsolable, yet the sum of all mysterious creative force? Primordial magic words seem to emanate from you, mysterious effects weave around you, and what powerful arts slumber in you? You pierce me with unbearable tension—what grimaces will you make? What terrible mystery will you create? Will you bring bad weather, storms, cold, thunder and lightning, or will you make the fields fruitful and bless the bodies of pregnant women? What is the mark of your being? Or don’t you need that, you son of the dark womb? Do you content yourself with the hazy darkness, whose concretion and crystal you are? Where in my soul do I shelter you? In my heart? Should my heart be your shrine, your holy of holies? So choose your place. I have accepted you. What crushing tension you bring with you! Isn’t the bow of my nerves breaking? I’ve taken in the messenger of the night.”</p>
<p>S: “The most powerful magic lives in it.”</p>
<p>I: “I feel it and yet can’t put into words the nightmarish power granted to it. I wanted to laugh, because so much alters in laughter, and resolves itself only there. But laughter dies in me. The magic of this rod is as solid as iron and as cold as death. Forgive me, my soul, I don’t want to be impatient, but it seems to me that something has got to happen to break through this unbearable tension that came with the rod.”</p>
<p>S: “Wait, keep your eyes and ears open.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m shuddering, and I don’t know why.”</p>
<p>S: “Sometimes one must shudder before—the greatest.”</p>
<p>I: “I bow, my soul, before unknown forces—I’d like to consecrate an altar to each unknown God. I must submit. The black iron in my heart gives me secret power. It’s like defiance and like—contempt for men.”241</p>
<p>[2] Oh dark act, violation, murder! Abyss, give birth to the unredeemed. Who is our redeemer? Who our leader? Where are the ways through black wastes? God, do not abandon us! What are you summoning, God? Raise your hand up to the darkness above you, pray, despair, wring your hands, kneel, press your forehead into the dust, cry out, but do not name Him, do not look at Him. Leave Him without name and form. What should form the formless? Name the nameless? Step onto the great way and grasp what is nearest. Do not look out, do not want, but lift up your hands. The gifts of darkness are full of riddles. The way is open to whomever can continue in spite of riddles. Submit to the riddles and the thoroughly incomprehensible. There are dizzying 128/130 [Image 129] 129/130 bridges over the eternally deep abyss. But follow the riddles.</p>
<p>Endure them, the terrible ones. It is still dark, and the terrible goes on growing. Lost and swallowed by the streams of procreating life, we approach the overpowering, inhuman forces that are busily creating what is to come. How much future the depths carry! Are not the threads spun down there over millennia?242 Protect the riddles, bear them in your heart, warm them, be pregnant with them. Thus you carry the future.</p>
<p>The tension of the future is unbearable in us. It must break through narrow cracks, it must force new ways. You want to cast off the burden, you want to escape the inescapable. Running away is deception and detour. Shut your eyes so that you do not see the manifold, the outwardly plural, the tearing away and the tempting. There is only one way and that is your way; there is only one salvation and that is your salvation. Why are you looking around for help? Do you believe that help will come from outside? What is to come will be created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you.</p>
<p>Oh, that all men and all their ways become strange to you! Thus might you find them again within yourself and recognize their ways. But what weakness! What doubt! What fear! You will not bear going your way. You always want to have at least one foot on paths not your own to avoid the great solitude! So that maternal comfort is always with you! So that someone acknowledges you, recognizes you, bestows trust in you, comforts you, encourages you. So that someone pulls you over onto their path, where you stray from yourself, and where it is easier for you to set yourself aside. As if you were not yourself! Who should accomplish your deeds? Who should carry your virtues and your vices? You do not come to an end with your life, and the dead will besiege you terribly to live your unlived life. Everything must be fulfilled. Time is of the essence, so why do you want to pile up the lived and let the unlived rot?</p>
<p>Great is the power of the way.243 In it Heaven and Hell grow together, and in it the power of the Below and the power of the Above unite. The nature of the way is magical, as are supplication and invocation;244 malediction and deed are magical if they occur on the great way. Magic is the working of men on men, but your magic action does not affect your neighbor; it affects you first, and only if you withstand it does an invisible effect pass from you to your neighbor. There is more of it in the air than I ever thought. However, it cannot be grasped. Listen:</p>

<p><em>A solitary is cooking up healing potions.</em></p>
<p><em>He makes offering to the four winds.</em></p>
<p><em>He greets the stars and touches the earth.</em></p>
<p><em>He holds something luminous in his hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Flowers sprout around him and the bliss of a new spring kisses all his limbs.</em></p>
<p><em>Birds fly around and the shy animals of the forest gaze at him.</em></p>
<p><em>He is far from men and yet the threads of their fate pass through his hands.</em></p>
<p><em>May your intercession be meant for him, so that his medicine grows ripe and strong and brings healing to the deepest wounds.</em></p>
<p><em>For your sake he is solitary and waits alone between Heaven and earth, for the earth to rise up to him and for Heaven to come down to him.</em></p>
<p><em>All peoples are still far off and stand behind the wall of darkness.</em></p>
<p><em>But I hear his words, which reach me from afar.</em></p>
<p><em>He has chosen a poor scribe, someone hard of hearing, who also stutters when he writes.</em></p>
<p><em>I do not recognize him, the solitary. What is he saying? He says: “I suffer fear and distress for the sake of man.”</em></p>
<p><em>I dug up old runes and magical sayings for words never reach men. Words have become shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore I took old magical apparatuses and prepared hot potions and mixed in secrets and ancient powers, things that even the cleverest would not guess at.</em></p>
<p><em>I stewed the roots of all human thoughts and deeds.</em></p>
<p><em>I watched over the cauldron through many starry nights. The brew ferments forever. I need your intercession, your kneeling, your desperation and your patience. I need your ultimate and highest longing, your purest willing, your most humble subjugation.</em></p>
<p><em>Solitary, who are you waiting for? Whose help do you require? There is none who can rush to your aid, since all look to you and wait for your healing art.</em></p>
<p><em>We are all utterly incapable and need help more than you. Grant us help so that we can help you in return.</em></p>
<p><em>The solitary speaks: “Will no one stand by me in this need? Should I leave my work to help you so that you can help me again? But how should I help you, if my brew has not grown ripe and strong? It was supposed to help you. What do you hope from me?”</em></p>
<p><em>Come to us! Why are you standing there cooking up marvels? What can your healing and magical potion do for us? Do you believe in healing potions? Look at life, behold how much it needs you!</em> 132/134 [Image 133] 133/134</p>
<p>*The solitary speaks: “Fools, can you not keep watch with me for an hour,*246 <em>until the difficult and long-lasting achieves completion and the juice has ripened?</em></p>
<p><em>Just a little longer and fermentation will be complete. Why can’t you wait? Why should your impatience destroy the highest opus?”</em></p>
<p><em>What highest opus? We are not alive; cold and numbness have seized us. Your opus, solitary one, will not be finished for aeons, even if it advances day after day.</em></p>
<p><em>The work of salvation is endless. Why do you want to wait for the end of this work? Even if your waiting turned you into stone for endless ages, you could not endure till the end. And if your salvation came to its end, you would have to be saved from your salvation again.</em></p>
<p><em>The solitary speaks: “What smooth-tongued lamentation reaches my ears! What whining! What foolish doubters you are! Unruly children! Persevere, it will be accomplished after this night!”</em></p>
<p><em>We will not wait a single night longer; we have persevered long enough. Are you a God, that a thousand nights are as one night to you? For us, this one night would be like a thousand nights. Abandon the work of salvation, and we will be saved. What stretch of ages are you saving us for?</em></p>
<p><em>The solitary speaks: “You embarrassing human swarm, you foolish bastard of God and cattle, I’m still lacking a piece of your precious flesh for my mixture. Am I truly your most valuable piece of meat? Is it worth my while to come to the boil for you? One let himself be nailed to the cross for you. One is truly enough. He blocks my way. Therefore neither will I walk on his ways, nor make for you any healing brew or immortal</em>247 <em>blood potion, but rather I will abandon the potion and cauldron and occult work for your sake, since you can neither wait for nor endure the fulfillment. I throw down your intercession, your genuflection, your invocations. You can save yourselves from both your lack of salvation and your salvation! Your worth rose quite high enough because one died for you. Now prove your worth by each living for himself. My God, how difficult it is to leave a work unfinished for the sake of men! But for the sake of men, I abstain from being a savior. Lo! Now my potion has completed its fermentation.

<p>The inexplicable occurs. You would very much like to forsake yourself and defect to each and every manifold possibility. You would very much like to risk every crime in order to steal for yourself the mystery of the changeful. But the road is without end.</p>
<p>The Way of the Cross</p>
<p>Cap. xx.249</p>
<p>[HI 136] 250I saw the black serpent,251 as it wound itself upward around the wood of the cross. It crept into the body of the crucified and emerged again transformed from his mouth. It had become white. It wound itself around the head of the dead one like a diadem, and a light gleamed above his head, and the sun rose shining in the east. I stood and watched and was confused and a great weight burdened my soul. But the white bird that sat on my shoulder spoke to me:252 “Let it rain, let the wind blow, let the waters flow and the fire burn. Let each thing have its development, let becoming have its day.”</p>
<p>[2] 2. Truly, the way leads through the crucified, that means through him to whom it was no small thing to live his own life, and who was therefore raised to magnificence. He did not simply teach what was knowable and worth knowing, he lived it. It is unclear how great one’s humility must be to take it upon oneself to live one’s own life. The disgust of whoever wants to enter into his own life can hardly be measured. Aversion will sicken him. He makes himself vomit. His bowels pain him and his brain sinks into lassitude. He would rather devise any trick to help him escape, since nothing matches the torment of one’s own way. It seems impossibly difficult, so difficult that nearly anything seems preferable to this torment. Not a few choose even to love people for fear of themselves. I believe, too, that some commit a crime to pick a quarrel with themselves. Therefore I cling to everything that obstructs my way to myself.</p>

<p>253He who goes to himself, climbs down. Pathetic and ridiculous forms appeared to the greatest prophet who came before this time, and these were the forms of his own essence. He did not accept them, but exorcized them before others. Ultimately, however, he was forced to celebrate a Last Supper with his own poverty and to accept these forms of his own essence out of compassion, which is precisely that acceptance of the lowest in us.254 But this enraged the mighty lion, who chased down the lost and restored it to the darkness of the depths.255 And like all those with power, the one with the great name wanted to erupt from the womb of the mountain like the sun.256 But what happened to him? His way led him before the crucified and he began to rage. He raged against the man of mockery and pain because the power of his own essence forced him to follow precisely this way as Christ had done before us. Yet he loudly proclaimed his power and greatness. No one speaks louder of his power and greatness than he from whom the earth disappears under his feet. Ultimately the lowest in him got to him, his incapacity, and this crucified his spirit, so that, as he himself had predicted, his soul died before his body.257</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one rises above himself who has not turned his most dangerous weapon against himself. One who wants to rise above himself shall climb down and hoist himself onto himself and lug himself to the place of sacrifice. But what must happen to a man until he realizes that outer visible success, that he can grasp with his hands, 136/137 leads him astray. What suffering must be brought upon humanity, until man gives up satisfying his longing for power over his fellow man and forever wanting others to be the same. How much blood must go on flowing until man opens his eyes and sees the way to his own path and himself as the enemy, and becomes aware of his real success. You ought to be able to live with yourself, but not at your neighbor’s expense. The herd animal is not his brother’s parasite and pest. Man, you have even forgotten that you too are an animal. You actually still seem to believe that life is better elsewhere. Woe unto you if your neighbor also thinks so. But you may be sure that he does. Someone must begin to stop being childish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your craving satisfies itself in you. You can offer no more precious a sacrificial meal to your God than yourself. May your greed consume you, for this wearies and calms it, and you will sleep well and consider the sun of each day as a gift. If you devour other things and other people, your greed remains eternally dissatisfied, for it craves more, the most costly—it craves you. And thus you compel your desire to take your own way. You may ask others provided that you need help and advice. But you should make demands on no one, neither desiring nor expecting anything from anyone except from yourself. For your craving satisfies itself only within you. You are afraid of burning in your own fire. May nothing prevent you from doing so, neither any one else’s sympathy nor your more dangerous sympathy with yourself. Since you should live and die with yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the flame of your greed consumes you, and nothing remains of you but ash, so nothing of you was steadfast. Yet the flame in which you consumed yourself has illuminated many. But if you flee from your fire full of fear, you scorch your fellow men, and the burning torment of your greed cannot die out, so long as you do not desire yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mouth utters the word, the sign, and the symbol. If the word is a sign, it means nothing. But if the word is a symbol, it means everything.258 When the way enters death and we are surrounded by rot and horror, the way rises in the darkness and leaves the mouth as the saving symbol, the word. It leads the sun on high, for in the symbol there is the release of the bound human force struggling with darkness. Our freedom does not lie outside us, but within us. One can be bound outside, and yet one will still feel free since one has burst inner bonds. One can certainly gain outer freedom through powerful actions, but one creates inner freedom only through the symbol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The symbol is the word that goes out of the mouth, that one does not simply speak, but that rises out of the depths of the self as a word of power and great need and places itself unexpectedly on the tongue. It is an astonishing and perhaps seemingly irrational word, but one recognizes it as a symbol since it is alien to the conscious mind. If one accepts the symbol, it is as if a door opens leading into a new room whose existence one previously did not know. But if one does not accept the symbol, it is as if one carelessly went past this door; and since this was the only door leading to the inner chambers, one must pass outside into the streets again, exposed to everything external. But the soul suffers great need, since outer freedom is of no use to it. Salvation is a long road that leads through many gates. These gates are symbols. Each new gate is at first invisible; indeed, it seems at first that 137/138 it must be created, for it exists only if one has dug up the spring’s root, the symbol.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To find the mandrake, one needs the black dog,259 since good and bad must always be united first if the symbol is to be created. The symbol can be neither thought up nor found: it becomes. Its becoming is like the becoming of human life in the womb. Pregnancy comes about through voluntary copulation. It goes on through willing attention. But if the depths have conceived, then the symbol grows out of itself and is born from the mind, as befits a God. But in the same way a mother would like to throw herself on the child like a monster and devour it again.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the new sun rises, the word steps out of my mouth, but is murdered lovelessly, since I did not know that it was the savior. The newborn child grows quickly, if I accept it. And immediately it becomes my charioteer. The word is the guide, the middle way which easily oscillates like the needle on the scales. The word is the God that rises out of the waters each morning and proclaims the guiding law to the people. Outer laws and outer wisdom are eternally insufficient, since there is only one law and one wisdom, namely my daily law, my daily wisdom. The God renews himself each night.</p>
<p>The God appears in multiple guises; for when he emerges, he has assumed some of the character of the night and the nightly waters in which he slumbered, and in which he struggled for renewal in the last hour of the night. Consequently his appearance is twofold and ambiguous; indeed, it even tears at the heart and the mind. On emerging, the God calls me toward the right and the left, his voice calling out to me from both sides. Yet the God wants neither the one nor the other. He wants the middle way. But the middle is the beginning of the long road.</p>
<p>Man, however, can never see this beginning; he always sees only one and not the other, or the other and not the one, but never that which the one as well as the other encloses in itself. The point of origin is where the mind and the will stand still; it is a state of suspension that evokes my outrage, my defiance and eventually my greatest fear. For I can see nothing anymore and can no longer want anything. Or at least that is how it seems to me. The way is a highly peculiar standstill of everything that was previously movement, it is a blind waiting, a doubtful listening and groping. One is convinced that one will burst. But the resolution is born from precisely this tension, and it almost always appears where one did not expect it.</p>
<p>But what is the resolution? It is always something ancient and precisely because of this something new, for when something long since passed away comes back again in a changed world, it is new. To give birth to the ancient in a new time is creation. This is the creation of the new, and that redeems me. Salvation is the resolution of the task. The task is to give birth to the old in a new time. The soul of humanity is like the great wheel of the zodiac that rolls along the way. Everything that comes up in a constant movement from below to the heights was already there. There is no part of the wheel that does not come around again. Hence everything that has been streams upward there, and what has been will be again. For these are all things which are the inborn properties of human nature. It belongs to the essence of forward movement that what was returns.260 Only the ignorant can marvel at this. Yet the meaning does not lie in the eternal recurrence of the same,261 but in the manner of its recurring creation at any given time.</p>
<p>The meaning lies in the manner and the direction of the recurring creation. But how do I create my charioteer? Or do I want to be my own charioteer? I can guide myself only with will and intention. But will and intention are simply part of myself. Consequently they are insufficient to express my wholeness. Intention is what I can foresee, and willing is to want a foreseen goal. But where do I find the goal? I take it from what is presently known to me. Thus I set the present in place of the future. In this 138/139 manner, though I cannot reach the future, I artificially produce a constant present. Everything that would like to break into this present strikes me as a disturbance, and I seek to drive it away so that my intention survives. Thus I close off the progress of life. But how can I be my own charioteer without will and intention? Therefore a wise man does not want to be a charioteer, for he knows that will and intention certainly attain goals but disturb the becoming of the future.</p>
<p>Futurity grows out of me; I do not create it, and yet I do, though not deliberately and willfully, but rather against will and intention. If I want to create the future, then I work against my future. And if I do not want to create it, once again I do not take sufficient part in the creation of the future, and everything happens then according to unavoidable laws to which I fall victim. The ancients devised magic to compel fate. They needed it to determine outer fate. We need it to determine inner fate and to find the way that we are unable to conceive. For a long time I considered what type of magic this would have to be. And in the end I found nothing. Whoever cannot find it within himself should become an apprentice, and so I took myself off to a far country where a great magician lived, of whose reputation I had heard.</p>
<p>The Magician262</p>
<p>Cap. xxi.</p>
<p>[HI: 139] {1} [1] 263After a long search I found the small house in the country fronted by a large bed of tulips. This is where ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ [Philemon], the magician, lives with his wife, ΒΑΥΚΙΣ [Baucis]. ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ is one of those magicians who has not yet managed to banish old age, but who lives it with dignity, and his wife can only do the same.264 Their interests seem to have become narrow, even childish. They water their bed of tulips and tell each other about the flowers that have newly appeared. And their days fade into a pale wavering chiaracuso, lit up by the past, only slightly frightened of the darkness of what is to come.</p>
<p>Why is ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ a magician?265 Does he conjure up immortality for himself, a life beyond? He was probably only a magician by profession, and he now appears to be a pensioned magician who has retired from service. His desirousness and creative drive have expired and he now enjoys his well-earned rest out of sheer incapacity, like every old man who can do nothing else than plant tulips and water his little garden. The magical rod lies in a cupboard together with the sixth and seventh books of Moses266 and the wisdom of ΕΡΜΗΣ ΤΡΙΣΜΕΓΙΣΤΥΣ [Hermes Trismegistus].267 ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ is old and has become somewhat feeble-minded. He still murmurs a few magical spells for the well-being of bewitched cattle in return for some petty cash or a gift for the kitchen. But it is uncertain if these spells are still correct and whether he understands their meaning. It is also clear that it hardly matters what he murmurs, 139/140 as the cattle might also get well on their own. There goes old ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ in the garden, bent, with a watering can in his shaking hand. Baucis stands at the kitchen window and looks at him calmly and impassively. She has already seen this image a thousand times—somewhat more infirm every time, feebler, seeing it a little less well every time since her eyesight gradually has become weaker.268</p>
<p>I stand at the garden gate. They have not noticed the stranger. “ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, old magician, how are you?” I call out to him. He does not hear me, seeming to be stone-deaf. I follow him and take his arm. He turns and greets me awkwardly and trembling. He has a white beard and thin white hair and a wrinkled face and there appears to be something about this face. His eyes are gray and old and something in them is strange, one would like to say alive. “I am well, stranger,” he says, “but what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>I: “People tell me that you understand the black art. I am interested in that. Will you tell me about it?”</p>
<p>Φ: “What should I tell you about? There is nothing to tell.”</p>
<p>I: “Don’t be ill-natured, old man, I want to learn.”</p>
<p>Φ: “You are certainly more learned than I. What could I teach you?”</p>
<p>I: “Do not be mean. I certainly don’t intend to become your competitor. I’m just curious to know what you are up to and what magic you are performing.”</p>
<p>Φ: “What do you want? In the past I have helped people here and there who have been sick and disadvantaged.”</p>
<p>I: “What exactly did you do?”</p>
<p>Φ: “Well, I did it quite simply with sympathy.”</p>
<p>I: “ Old man, that word sounds comical and ambiguous.”</p>
<p>Φ: “How so?”</p>
<p>I: “It could mean that you helped people either by expressing compassion or by superstitious, sympathetic means.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Well, surely it would have been both.”</p>
<p>I: “And that’s all there was to your magic?”</p>
<p>Φ: “There was more.”</p>
<p>I: “What was it, tell me.”</p>
<p>Φ: “That is none of your business. You are impertinent and meddlesome.”</p>
<p>I: “Please, don’t take my curiosity badly. Recently I heard something about magic that awakened my interest in this bygone practice. And then I came to you because I heard that you understand the black art. If magic were still taught today at university, I would have studied it there. But the last college of magic was closed long ago. Today no professor knows anything anymore about magic. So do not be sensitive and miserly, but tell me a bit about your art. Surely, you don’t want to take your secrets with you to the grave, do you?”</p>
<p>Φ: “Well, all you will do is laugh anyway. So why should I tell you anything? It would be better if everything were buried with me. It can always be rediscovered later. It will never be lost to humanity, since magic is reborn with each and every one of us.”</p>
<p>I: “What do you mean? Do you believe that magic is really inborn in man?”</p>
<p>Φ: “If I could, I would say, yes, of course, it is. But you will find this laughable.”</p>
<p>I: “No, this time I will not laugh, because I have often wondered about the fact that all peoples in all times and in all places have the same magical customs. As you can see, I have already thought along similar lines.”</p>
<p>Φ: “What do you make of magic?”</p>
<p>I: “To put it plainly, nothing, or very little. It appears to me that magic is one of the vain tools of men inferior to nature. I can detect no other tangible meaning in magic.”</p>
<p>Φ: Your professors probably also know just as much.”</p>
<p>I: “Yes, but what do you know about it?”</p>
<p>Φ: “I’d prefer not to say.”</p>
<p>I: “Don’t be so secretive, old man, otherwise I must assume that you know no more than I do.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Take it as you please.”</p>
<p>I: “Your answer suggests that you most definitely understand more about it than others.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Comical fellow, how stubborn you are! But what I like about you is that your reason does not deter you.”</p>
<p>I: “That’s actually the case. Whenever I want to learn and understand something, I leave my so-called reason at home and give whatever it is that I am trying to understand the benefit of the doubt. I have learned this gradually, because nowadays the world of science is full of scary examples of the opposite.”</p>
<p>Φ: “In which case you could do very well for yourself.” 140/141</p>
<p>I: “I hope so. Now, let us not stray from magic.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Why are you so determined about learning more about magic, if you claim that you have left your reason at home? Or would you not consider consistency part of reason?”</p>
<p>I: “I do—I see, or rather, it seems as if you are quite an adept sophist, who skillfully leads me around the house and back to the door.”</p>
<p>Φ: “It seems that way to you because you judge everything from the standpoint of your intellect. If you forsake reason for a while, you will also give up consistency.”</p>
<p>I: “That’s a difficult test. But if I want to be adept at some point, I suppose I ought to submit to your request. All right, I’m listening.”</p>
<p>Φ: “What do you want to hear?”</p>
<p>I: “You’re not going to draw me out. I’m simply waiting for whatever you are going to say.”</p>
<p>Φ: “And what if I say nothing?”</p>
<p>I: “Well, then I’ll withdraw somewhat embarrassed and think that ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ is at the very least a shrewd fox, who definitely would have something to teach me.”</p>
<p>Φ: “With this, my boy, you have learned something about magic.”</p>
<p>I: “I’ll have to chew on this. I must admit that this is somewhat surprising. I had imagined magic as being somewhat different.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Well, this shows you how little you understand about magic and how incorrect your notion of it is.”</p>
<p>I: “If this should be the case, or that’s how it is, then I must confess that I approached the problem completely incorrectly. I gather from what you are saying that these matters do not follow ordinary understanding.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Nor does magic.”</p>
<p>I: “But you have not deterred me at all; on the contrary, I’m burning to hear even more. What I know up to now is essentially negative.”</p>
<p>Φ: “With this you have recognized a second main point. Above all, you must know that magic is the negative of what one can know.”</p>
<p>I: “That, too, my dear ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, is a piece of knowledge that is hard to digest and causes me no small pain. The negative of what one can know? I suppose you mean that it cannot be known, don’t you? This exhausts my understanding.”</p>
<p>Φ: “That is the third point that you must note as essential: namely, that there is nothing for you to understand.”</p>
<p>I: “Well, I must confess that that is new and strange. So nothing at all about magic can be understood?”</p>
<p>Φ: “Exactly. Magic happens to be precisely everything that eludes comprehension.”</p>
<p>I: “But then how the devil is one to teach and learn magic?”</p>
<p>Φ: “Magic is neither to be taught nor learned. It’s foolish that you want to learn magic.”</p>
<p>I: “But then magic is nothing but deception.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Watch out—you have started reasoning again.”</p>
<p>I: “It’s difficult to exist without reason.”</p>
<p>Φ: “And that is exactly how difficult magic is.”</p>
<p>I: “Well, in that case it’s hard work. I conclude that it is an inescapable condition for the adept that he completely unlearns his reason.”</p>
<p>Φ: “I’m afraid that is what it amounts to.”</p>
<p>I: “Ye Gods, this is serious.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Not as serious as you think. Reason declines with old age, since it is an essential counterpart of the drives, which are much more intense in youth than in old age. Have you ever seen young magicians?”</p>
<p>I: “No, the magician is proverbially old.”</p>
<p>Φ: “You see, I’m right.”</p>
<p>I: “But then the prospects of the adept are bad. He must wait until old age to experience the mysteries of magic.”</p>
<p>Φ: “If he gives up his reason before then, he can already experience something useful sooner.”</p>
<p>I: “That seems to me to be a dangerous experiment. One cannot give up reason without further ado.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Nor can one 141/142 simply become a magician.”</p>
<p>I: “You lay damnable snares.”</p>
<p>Φ: “What do you want? Such is magic.”</p>
<p>I: “Old devil, you make me envious of unreasoning old age.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Well, well, a youth who wants to be an old man! And why? He wants to learn magic and yet dares not to for the sake of his youth.”</p>
<p>I: “You spread a terrible net, old trapper.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Perhaps you should still wait a few years with magic until your hair has gone gray and your reason has slackened somewhat.”</p>
<p>I: “I don’t want to listen to your scorn. Stupidly enough, I got caught up in your yarn. I can’t make sense of you.”</p>
<p>Φ: “But stupidity would perhaps be progress on the way to magic.”</p>
<p>I: “Incidentally, what on earth do you intend to achieve with your magic?”</p>
<p>Φ: “I am alive, as you see.”</p>
<p>I: “Other old men are, too.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Yes, but have you seen how?”</p>
<p>I: “Well, admittedly it was not a pleasant sight. Incidentally, time has left its mark on you, too.”</p>
<p>Φ: “I know.”</p>
<p>I: “So, what gives you the advantage?”</p>
<p>Φ: “It doesn’t exactly meet the eye.”</p>
<p>I: “What kind of advantage doesn’t meet the eye?”</p>
<p>Φ: “I call that magic.”</p>
<p>I: “You’re moving in a vicious circle. May the devil get the better of you.”</p>
<p>Φ: “Well, that’s another advantage of magic: not even the devil gets the better of me. You’re beginning to understand magic, so I must assume that you have a good aptitude for it.”</p>
<p>I: “Thank you, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, that is enough; I feel dizzy. Goodbye!”</p>
<p>I leave the small garden and walk down the street. People are standing around in groups and glancing at me furtively. I hear them whispering behind my back: “Look, there he goes, old ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ’s student. He spoke a long time with the old man. He has learned something. He knows the mysteries. If only I could do what he is able to do now.” “Be quiet, you damned fools,” I want to call out to them, but I cannot, since I do not know whether I have actually learned anything. And because I remain silent, they are even more convinced that I have received the black art from ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ.</p>
<p>269[2] [HI 142] <em>It is an error to believe that there are</em> magical practices that one can learn. One cannot understand magic. One can only understand what accords with reason. Magic accords with unreason, which one cannot understand. The world accords not only with reason but also with unreason. But just as one employs reason to make sense of the world, in that what is reasonable about it approaches reason, a lack of understanding also accords with unreason. 142/143</p>
<p>This meeting is magical and eludes comprehension. Magical understanding is what one calls noncomprehension. Everything that works magically is incomprehensible, and the incomprehensible often works magically. One calls incomprehensible workings magical. The magical always surrounds me, always involves me. It opens spaces that have no doors and leads out into the open where there is no exit. The magical is good and evil and neither good nor evil. Magic is dangerous since what accords with unreason confuses, allures and provokes; and I am always its first victim.</p>
<p>Where reason abides, one needs no magic. Hence our time no longer needs magic. Only those without reason needed it to replace their lack of reason. But it is thoroughly unreasonable to bring together what suits reason with magic since they have nothing to do with one another. Both become spoiled through being brought together. Therefore all those lacking reason quite rightly fall into superfluity and disregard. A rational man of this time will therefore never use magic.270</p>
<p>But it is another thing for whoever has opened the chaos in himself. We need magic to be able to receive or invoke the messenger and the communication of the incomprehensible. We recognized that the world comprises reason and unreason; and we also understood that our way needs not only reason but also unreason. This distinction is arbitrary and depends upon the level of comprehension. But one can be certain that the greater part of the world eludes our understanding. We must value the incomprehensible and unreasonable equally, although they are not necessarily equal in themselves; a part of the incomprehensible, however, is only presently incomprehensible and might already concur with reason tomorrow. But as long as one does not understand it, it remains unreasonable. Insofar as the incomprehensible accords with reason, one may try to think it with success; but insofar as it is unreasonable, 143/144 one needs magical practices to open it up.</p>
<p>The practice of magic consists in making what is not understood understandable in an incomprehensible manner. The magical way is not arbitrary, since that would be understandable, but it arises from incomprehensible grounds. Besides, to speak of grounds is incorrect, since grounds concur with reason. Nor can one speak of the groundless, since hardly anything further can be said about this. The magical way arises by itself. If one opens up chaos, magic also arises.</p>
<p>One can teach the way that leads to chaos, but one cannot teach magic. One can only remain silent about this, which seems to be the best apprenticeship. This view is confusing, but this is what magic is like. Where reason establishes order and clarity, magic causes disarray and a lack of clarity.271 One indeed needs reason for the magical translation of the not-understood into the understandable, since only by means of reason can the understandable be created. No one can say how to use reason, but it does arise if one tries to express only what an opening of chaos means.272</p>
<p>Magic is a way of living. If one has done one’s best to steer the chariot, and one then notices that a greater other is actually steering it, then magical operation takes place. One cannot say what the effect of magic will be, since no one can know it in advance because the magical is the lawless, which occurs without rules and by chance, so to speak. But the condition is that one totally accepts it and does not reject it, in order to transfer everything to the growth of the tree. Stupidity too is part of this, which everyone has a great deal of, and also tastelessness, which is possibly the greatest nuisance.</p>
<p>Thus a certain solitude and isolation are inescapable conditions of life for the well-being of oneself and of the other, otherwise one cannot 144/145 sufficiently be oneself. A certain slowness of life, which is like a standstill, will be unavoidable. The uncertainty of such a life will most probably be its greatest burden, but still I must unite the two conflicting powers of my soul and keep them together in a true marriage until the end of my life, since the magician is called ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and his wife ΒΑΥΚΙΣ. I hold together what Christ has kept apart in himself and through his example in others, since the more the one half of my being strives toward the good, the more the other half journeys to Hell.</p>
<p>When the month of the Twins had ended, the men said to their shadows: “You are I,” since they had previously had their spirit around them as a second person. Thus the two became one, and through this collision the formidable broke out, precisely that spring of consciousness that one calls culture and which lasted until the time of Christ.273 But the fish indicated the moment when what was united split, according to the eternal law of contrasts, into an underworld and upperworld. If the power of growth begins to cease, then the united falls into its opposites. Christ sent what is beneath to Hell, since it strives toward the good. That had to be. But the separated cannot remain separated forever. It will be united again and the month of the fish will soon be over.274 We suspect and understand that growth needs both, and hence we keep good and evil close together. Because we know that too far into the good means the same as too far into evil, we keep them both together.275</p>
<p>But we thus lose direction and things no longer flow from the mountain to the valley, but grow quietly from the valley to the mountain. That which we can no longer prevent or hide is our fruit. The flowing stream becomes a lake and an ocean 145/146 that has no outlet, unless its water rises to the sky as steam and falls from the clouds as rain. While the sea is a death, it is also the place of rising. Such is ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, who tends his garden. Our hands have been tied, and each must sit quietly in his place. He rises invisibly and falls as rain on distant lands.276 The water on the ground is no cloud, which should rain. Only pregnant women can give birth, not those who have yet to conceive.277</p>
<p>[HI 146] <em>But what mystery are you intimating</em> to me with your name, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ? Truly you are the lover who once took in the Gods as they wandered the earth when everyone else refused them lodging. You are the one who unsuspectingly gave hospitality to the Gods; they thanked you by transforming your house into a golden temple, while the flood swallowed everyone else. You remained alive when chaos erupted. You it was who served in the sanctuary when the peoples called out in vain to the Gods. Truly, it is the lover who survives. Why did we not see that? And just when did the Gods manifest? Precisely when ΒΑΥΚΙΣ wished to serve the esteemed guests her only goose, that blessed stupidity: the animal fled to the Gods who then revealed themselves to their poor hosts, who had given their last. Thus I saw that the lover survives, and that he is the one who unwittingly grants hospitality to the Gods.278</p>
<p>Truly, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, I did not see that your hut is a temple, and that you, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, and ΒΑΥΚΙΣ, serve in the sanctuary. 146/147 This magical power allows itself to be neither taught nor learned. Either one has it or does not have it. Now I know your final mystery: you are a lover. You have succeeded in uniting what has been sundered, that is, binding together the Above and Below. Have we not known this for a long time? Yes, we knew it, no, we did not know it. It has always been this way, and yet it has never been thus. Why did I have to wander such long roads before I came to ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, if he was going to teach me what has been common knowledge for ages? Alas, we have known everything since time immemorial and yet we will never know it until it is has been accomplished. Who exhausts the mystery of love?</p>
<p>[HI 147] <em>Under which mask, Oh</em> ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, are you hiding? You did not strike me as a lover. But my eyes were opened, and I saw that you are a lover of your soul, who anxiously and jealously guards its treasure. There are those who love men, and those who love the souls of men, and those who love their own soul. Such a one is ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, the host of the Gods.</p>
<p><em>You lie in the sun, Oh</em> ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, like a serpent that coils around itself. Your wisdom is the wisdom of serpents, cold, with a grain of poison, yet healing in small doses. Your magic paralyzes and therefore makes strong people, who tear themselves away from themselves. But do they love you, are they thankful, lover of your own soul? Or do they curse you for your magical serpent poison? They keep their distance, shaking their heads and whispering together.</p>
<p>Are you still a man, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, or 147/148 is one not a man until one is a lover of one’s own soul? You are hospitable, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you took the dirty wanderers unsuspectingly into your hut. Your house then became a golden temple, and did I really leave your table unsatisfied? What did you give me? Did you invite me for a meal? You shimmered multicolored and inextricable; nowhere did you give yourself to me as prey. You escaped my grasp. I found you nowhere. Are you still a man? Your kind is far more serpentlike.</p>
<p>I sought to grab hold of you and tear it out of you, since the Christians have learned to devour their God. And how long will it take for what happens to the God also to happen to man? I look into the vast land and hear nothing but wailing and see nothing but men consuming each other.</p>
<p>Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you are no Christian. You did not let yourself be engorged and did not engorge me. Because of this you have neither lecture halls nor columned halls teeming with students who stand around and speak of the master and soak up his words like the elixir of life. You are no Christian and no pagan, but a hospitable inhospitable one, a host of the Gods, a survivor, an eternal one, the father of all eternal wisdom.</p>
<p>But did I really leave you unsatisfied? No, I left you because I was really satisfied. Yet what did I eat? Your words gave me nothing. Your words left me to myself and my doubt. And so I ate myself. And because of this, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you are no Christian, since you nourish yourself from yourself and force men to do the same. This displeases them most, since nothing disgusts the human animal more than itself. Because of this they would rather eat all crawling, hopping, swimming and flying creatures, yes, even their own species, before they nibble at themselves. But this nourishment is effective and one is soon satiated from it. Because of this, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, we rise satiated from your table.</p>
<p>Your way, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, is instructive. You leave me in a salutary darkness, where there is nothing for me to either see or look for. You are no light that shines in the darkness,279 no savior who establishes an eternal truth and thus extinguishes the 148/149 nocturnal light of human understanding. You leave room for the stupidity and jokes of others. You do not want, Oh blessed one, anything from the other, but instead you tend the flowers in your own garden. He who needs you asks you, and, Oh clever ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, I suppose that you also ask those from whom you need something and that you pay for what you receive. Christ has made men desirous, for ever since they expect gifts from their saviors without any service in return. Giving is as childish as power. He who gives presumes himself powerful. The virtue of giving is the sky-blue mantle of the tyrant. You are wise, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you do not give. You want your garden to bloom, and for everything to grow from within itself.</p>
<p>I praise, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, your lack of acting like a savior; you are no shepherd who runs after stray sheep, since you believe in the dignity of man, who is not necessarily a sheep. But if he happens to be a sheep, you would leave him the rights and dignity of sheep, since why should sheep be made into men? There are still more than enough men.</p>
<p>You know, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, the wisdom of things to come; therefore you are old, oh so very ancient, and just as you tower above me in years, so you tower above the present in futurity, and the length of your past is immeasurable. You are legendary and unreachable. You were and will be, returning periodically. Your wisdom is invisible, your truth is unknowable, entirely untrue in any given age, and yet true in all eternity, but you pour out living water, from which the flowers of your garden bloom, a starry water, a dew of the night.</p>
<p>What do you need, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ? You need men for the sake of small things, since everything greater and the greatest thing is in you. Christ spoiled men, since he taught them that they can be saved only by one, namely Him, the Son of God, and ever since men have been demanding the greater things from others, especially their salvation; and if a sheep gets lost 149/150 somewhere, it accuses the shepherd. Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you are a man, and you prove that men are not sheep, since you look after the greatest in yourself, and hence fructifying water flows into your garden from inexhaustible jugs.</p>
<p>[HI 150] <em>Are you lonely, Oh</em> ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, I see no entourage and no companions around you; ΒΑΥΚΙΣ is only your other half. You live with flowers, trees, and birds, but not with men. Should you not live with men? Are you still a man? Do you want nothing from men? Do you not see how they stand together and concoct rumors and childish fairy tales about you? Do you not want to go to them and say that you are a man and a mortal as they are, and that you want to love them? Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you laugh? I understand you. Just now I ran into your garden and wanted to tear out of you what I had to understand from within myself.</p>
<p>Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, I understand: immediately I made you into a savior who lets himself be consumed and bound with gifts. That’s what men are like, you think; they are all still Christians. But they want even more: they want you as you are, otherwise you would not be ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ to them and they would be inconsolable, if they could find no bearer for their legends. Hence they would also laugh, if you approached them and said you were as mortal as they are and want to love them. If you did that, you would not be ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ. They want you, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, but not another mortal who suffers from the same ills as they do.</p>
<p>I understand you, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you are a true 150/151 lover, since you love your soul for the sake of men, because they need a king who lives from himself and owes no one gratitude for his life. They want to have you thus. You fulfill the wish of the people and you vanish. You are a vessel of fables. You would besmirch yourself if you went to men as a man, since they would all laugh and call you a liar and a swindler, since ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ is not a man.</p>
<p>I saw, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, that crease in your face: you were young once and wanted to be a man among men. But the Christian animals did not love your pagan humanity, since they felt in you what they needed. They always sought the branded one, and when they caught him somewhere in freedom, they locked him in a golden cage and took from him the force of his masculinity, so that he was paralyzed and sat in silence. Then they praise him and devise fables about him. I know, they call this veneration. And if they do not find the true one, they at least have a Pope, whose occupation it is to represent the divine comedy. But the true one always disowns himself, since he knows nothing higher than to be a man.</p>
<p>Are you laughing, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ? I understand you: it irked you to be a man like others. And because you truly loved being human, you voluntarily locked it away so that you could be for men at least what they wanted to have from you. Therefore I see you, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, not with men, but wholly with flowers, the trees and the birds and all waters flowing and still that do not besmirch your humanity. For you are not ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ to the flowers, trees, and birds, but a man. Yet what solitude, what inhumanity! 151/152</p>
<p>[HI 152] <em>Why are you laughing, Oh</em> ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, <em>I cannot fathom you. But do I not see the blue air of your garden? What happy shades surround you? Does the sun hatch blue midday specters around you?</em></p>
<p>Are you laughing, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ? Alas, I understand you: humanity has completely faded for you, but its shadow has arisen for you. How much greater and happier the shadow of humanity is than it is itself! The blue midday shadows of the dead! Alas, there is your humanity, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you are a teacher and friend of the dead. They stand sighing in the shade of your house, they live under the branches of your trees. They drink the dew of your tears, they warm themselves at the goodness of your heart, they hunger after the words of your wisdom, which sounds full to them, full of the sounds of life. I saw you, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, at the noonday hour when the sun stood highest; you stood speaking with a blue shade, blood stuck to its forehead and solemn torment darkened it. I can guess, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, who your midday guest was.280 How blind I was, fool that I am! That is you, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ! But who am I! I go my way, shaking my head, and people’s looks follow me and I remain silent. Oh despairing silence! 152/153 [HI 153]</p>
<p><em>Oh master of the garden! I see your dark tree from afar in the shimmering sun. My street leads to the valleys where men live. I am a wandering beggar. And I remain silent.</em></p>
<p>Killing off would-be prophets is a gain for the people. If they want murder, then may they kill their false prophets. If the mouth of the Gods remains silent, then each can listen to his own speech. He who loves the people remains silent. If only false teachers teach, the people will kill the false teachers, and will fall into the truth even on the way of their sins. Only after the darkest night will it be day. So cover the lights and remain silent so that the night will become dark and noiseless. The sun rises without our help. Only he who knows the darkest error knows what light is.</p>
<p><em>Oh master of the garden, your magical grove shone to me from afar. I venerate your deceptive mantle, you father of all will-o’-the-wisps.</em> 153/154281 [Image 154]282</p>
<p>I continue on my way, accompanied by a finely polished piece of steel, hardened in ten fires, stowed safely in my robe. Secretly, I wear chain mail under my coat. Overnight I became fond of serpents, and I solved their riddle. I sit down next to them on the hot stones lying by the wayside. I know how to catch them cunningly and cruelly, those cold devils that prick the heel of the unsuspecting. I became their friend and played a softly toned flute. But I decorate my cave with their dazzling skins. As I walked on my way, I came to a red rock on which a great iridescent serpent lay. Since I had now learned magic from ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, I took out my flute again and played a sweet magical song to make her believe that she was my soul. When she was sufficiently enchanted, 154/155 [Image 155]283 {2} [1]284 I spoke to her: “My sister, my soul, what do you say?” But she spoke, flattered and therefore tolerantly: “I let grass grow over everything that you do.”</p>
<p>I: “That sounds comforting and seems not to say much.”</p>
<p>S: “Would you like me to say much? I can also be banal, as you know, and let myself be satisfied that way.”</p>
<p>I: “That seems hard to me. I believe that you stand in a close connection with everything beyond, 155/156285 with what is greatest and most uncommon. Therefore I thought that banality would be foreign to you.”</p>
<p>S: “Banality is my element.”</p>
<p>I: “That would be less astonishing if I said it about myself.”</p>
<p>S: “The more uncommon you are, the more common I can be. A true respite for me. I think you can sense that I don’t need to torment myself today.”</p>
<p>I: “I can feel it, and I’m worried that your tree will ultimately bear me no more fruit.”</p>
<p>S: “Worried already? Don’t be stupid, and let me rest.”</p>
<p>I: “I notice that you like being banal. But I do not take you to heart, my dear friend, since I now know you much better than before.”</p>
<p>S: “You’re getting to be familiar. I’m afraid that you are beginning to lose respect.”</p>
<p>I: “Are you upset? I believe that would be uncalled for. I’m sufficiently well-informed about the proximity of pathos and banality.”</p>
<p>S: “So, have you noticed that the becoming of the soul follows a serpentine path? Have you seen how soon day becomes night, and night day? How water and dry land change places? And that everything spasmodic is merely destructive?”</p>
<p>I: “I believe that I saw all this. I want to lie in the sun on this warm stone for a while. Perhaps the sun will incubate me.”</p>
<p>But the serpent crept up to me quietly and wound herself smoothly around my feet.286 Evening fell and night came. I spoke to the serpent and said: “I don’t know what to say. All pots are on the boil.”</p>
<p>287S: “A meal is being prepared.”</p>
<p>I: “A Last Supper, I suppose?”</p>
<p>S: “A union with all humanity.”</p>
<p>I: “A horrifying, sweet thought: to be both guest and dish at this meal.”288</p>
<p>S: “That was also Christ’s highest pleasure.”</p>
<p>I: “How holy, how sinful, how everything hot and cold flows into one another! Madness and reason want to be married, the lamb and the wolf graze peacefully side by side.289 It is all yes and no. The opposites embrace each other, see eye to eye, and intermingle. They recognize their oneness in agonizing pleasure. My heart is filled with wild battle. The waves of dark and bright rivers rush together, one crashing over the other. I have never experienced this before.”</p>
<p>S: “That is new, my dear one, at least for you.”</p>
<p>I: “I suppose you are mocking me. But tears and laughter are one.290 156/157 I no longer feel like either and I am rigid with tension. Loving reaches up to Heaven and resisting reaches just as high. They are entwined and will not let go of each other, since the excessive tension seems to indicate the ultimate and highest possibility of feeling.”</p>
<p>S: “You express yourself emotionally and philosophically. You know that one can say all this much more simply. For example, one can say that you have fallen in love all the way from the worm up to Tristan and Isolde.291</p>
<p>I: “Yes, I know, but nonetheless—”</p>
<p>S: “Religion is still tormenting you, it seems? How many shields do you still need? Much better to say it straight out.”</p>
<p>I:” You’re not tripping me up.”</p>
<p>S: “Well, what is it with morality? Have morality and immorality also become one today?”</p>
<p>I: “You’re mocking me, my sister and chthonic devil. But I must say that those two that rose up to Heaven entwined are also good and evil. I’m not joking but I groan, because joy and pain sound shrill together.”</p>
<p>S: “Where then is your understanding? You’ve gone utterly stupid. After all, you could resolve everything by thinking.”</p>
<p>I: “My understanding? My thinking? I no longer have any understanding. It has grown impervious to me.”</p>
<p>S: “You deny everything that you believed. You’ve completely forgotten who you are. You even deny Faust, who walked calmly past all the specters.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m no longer up to this. My spirit, too, is a specter.”</p>
<p>S: “Ah, I see, you follow my teaching.”</p>
<p>I: “Unfortunately, that’s the case, and it has benefited me with painful joy.”</p>
<p>S: “You turn your pain into pleasure. You are twisted, blinded; just suffer, you fool.”</p>
<p>I: “This misfortune ought to make me happy.”</p>
<p>The serpent now became angry and tried to bite my heart, but my secret armor broke her poisonous fang.292 She drew back astonished and said hissing: “You actually behave as if you were unfathomable.”</p>
<p>I: “That’s because I have studied the art of stepping from the left foot onto the right and vice versa, which others have done unthinkingly from time immemorial.”</p>
<p>The serpent raised herself again, as if accidentally 157/158 holding her tail in front of her mouth, so that I should not see the broken fang. Proudly and calmly she said293: “So you have finally noticed this?” But I spoke to her smilingly: “The sinuous line of life could not escape me in the long run.”</p>
<p>[2] [HI 158] Where is truth and faith? Where is warm trust? You find all this between men but not between men and serpents, even if they are serpent souls. But wherever there is love, the serpentlike abides also. Christ himself compared himself to a serpent,294 and his hellish brother, the Antichrist, is the old dragon himself.295 What is beyond the human that appears in love has the nature of the serpent and the bird, and the serpent often enchants the bird, and more rarely the bird bears off the serpent. Man stands in-between. What seems like a bird to you is a serpent to the other, and what seems like a serpent to you is a bird to the other. Therefore you will meet the other only in human form. If you want to become, then a battle between bird and serpent breaks out. And if you only want to be, you will be a man to yourself and to others. He who is becoming belongs in the desert or in a prison, for he is beyond the human. If men want to become, they behave like animals. No one saves us from the evil of becoming, unless we choose to go through Hell.</p>
<p>Why did I behave as if that serpent were my soul? Only, it seems, because my soul was a serpent. This knowledge gave my soul a new face, and I decided henceforth to enchant her myself and subject her to my power. Serpents are wise, and I wanted my serpent soul to communicate her wisdom to me. Never before had life been so doubtful, a night of aimless tension, being one in being directed against one another. Nothing moved, neither God nor the devil. So I approached the serpent that lay in the sun, as if she were unthinking. Her eyes were not visible, since they blinked in the shimmering sunshine, and 158/160 [Image 159]296 159/160 {3} [1] I spoke to her297: “How will it be, now that God and the devil have become one? Are they in agreement to bring life to a standstill? Does the conflict of opposites belong to the inescapable conditions of life? And does he who recognizes and lives the unity of opposites stand still? He has completely taken the side of actual life, and he no longer acts as if he belonged to one party and had to battle against the other, but he is both and has brought their discord to an end. Through taking this burden from life, has he also taken the force from it?”298</p>
<p>The serpent turned and spoke ill-humoredly: “Truly, you pester me. Opposites were certainly an element of life for me. You probably will have noticed this. Your innovations deprive me of this source of power. I can neither lure you with pathos nor annoy you with banality. I am somewhat baffled.”</p>
<p>I: “If you are baffled, should I give counsel? I would rather you dive down to the deeper grounds to which you have entry and ask Hades or the heavenly ones, perhaps someone there can give counsel.”</p>
<p>S: “You have become imperious.”</p>
<p>I: “Necessity is even more imperious than I. I must live and be able to move.”</p>
<p>S: “You have the whole wide earth. What do you want to ask the beyond for?”</p>
<p>I: “It isn’t curiosity that drives me, but necessity. I will not yield.”</p>
<p>S: “I obey, but reluctantly. This style is new and unaccustomed to me.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m sorry, but there is pressing need. Tell the depths that prospects are not looking too good for us, because we have cut off an important organ from life. As you know, I’m not the guilty one, since you have led me carefully along this way.”</p>
<p>S:299 “You might have rejected the apple.”</p>
<p>I: “Enough of these jokes. You know that story better than I do. I am serious. We need some air. Be on your way and fetch the fire. It has already been dark around me for too long. Are you sluggish or cowardly?”</p>
<p>S: “I’m off to work. Take from me what I bring up.”300</p>
<p>[HI 160] Slowly, the throne of the God ascends into empty space, followed by the holy trinity, all of Heaven, and finally Satan himself. He resists and clings to his beyond. He will not 160/161 let it go. The upperworld is too chilly for him.</p>
<p>S: “Have you got tight hold of him?”301</p>
<p>I: “Welcome, hot thing of darkness! My soul probably pulled you up roughly?”</p>
<p>S:302 “Why this noise? I protest against this violent extraction.”</p>
<p>I: “Calm down. I didn’t expect you. You come last of all. You seem to be the hardest part.”</p>
<p>S: “What do you want from me? I don’t need you, impertinent fellow.”</p>
<p>I: “It’s a good thing we have you. You’re the liveliest thing in the whole dogma.”303</p>
<p>S: “What concern is your prattle to me! Make it quick. I’m freezing.”</p>
<p>I: “Listen, something has just happened to us: we have united the opposites. Among other things, we have bonded you with God.”304</p>
<p>S: “For God’s sake, why this hopeless fuss? Why such nonsense?”</p>
<p>I: “Please, that wasn’t so stupid. This unification is an important principle. We have put a stop to never-ending quarreling, to finally free our hands for real life.”</p>
<p>S: “This smells of monism. I have already made note of some of these men. Special chambers have been heated for them.”</p>
<p>I: “You’re mistaken. Matters are not as rational with us as they seem to be.305 We have no single correct truth either. Rather, a most remarkable and strange fact has occurred: after the opposites had been united, quite unexpectedly and incomprehensibly nothing further happened. Everything remained in place, peacefully and yet completely motionless, and life turned into a complete standstill.”</p>
<p>S: “Yes, you fools, you certainly have made a pretty mess of things.”</p>
<p>I: “Well, your mockery is unnecessary. Our intentions were serious.”</p>
<p>S: “Your seriousness leads us to suffer. The ordering of the beyond is shaken to its foundations.”</p>
<p>I: “So you realize that matters are serious. I want an answer to my question, what should happen under these circumstances? We no longer know what to do.”</p>
<p>S: “Well, it is hard to know what to do, and difficult to give advice even if one would like to give it. You are blinded fools, a brashly impertinent people. Why didn’t you stay out of trouble? How do you mean to understand the ordering of the world?”</p>
<p>I: “Your ranting suggests that you are quite thoroughly aggrieved. Look, the holy trinity is taking things coolly. It seems not to dislike the innovation.”</p>
<p>S: “Ah, the trinity is so irrational that one 161/162 can never trust its reactions. I strongly advise you not to take those symbols seriously.”306</p>
<p>I: “I thank you for this well-meant advice. But you seem to be interested. One would expect you to pass unbiased judgment on account of your proverbial intelligence.”</p>
<p>S: “Me, unbiased! You can judge for yourself. If you consider this absoluteness in its completely lifeless equanimity, you can easily discover that the state and standstill produced by your presumptuousness closely resembles the absolute. But if I counsel you, I place myself completely on your side, since you too find this standstill unbearable.”</p>
<p>I: “What? You take my side? That is strange.”</p>
<p>S: “That’s not so strange. The absolute was always adverse to the living. I am still the real master of life.”</p>
<p>I: “That is suspicious. Your reaction is far too personal.”</p>
<p>S: “My reaction is far from personal. I am utterly restless, quickly hurrying life. I am never contented, never unperturbed. I pull everything down and hastily rebuild. I am ambition, greed for fame, lust for action; I am the fizz of new thoughts and action. The absolute is boring and vegetative.”</p>
<p>I: “All right, I believe you. So—just what do you advise?”</p>
<p>S: “The best advice I can give you is: revoke your completely harmful innovation as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>I: “What would be gained by that? We’d have to start from scratch again and would infallibly reach the same conclusion a second time. What one has grasped once, one cannot intentionally not know again and undo. Your counsel is no counsel.”</p>
<p>S: “But could you exist without divisiveness and disunity? You have to get worked up about something, represent a party, overcome opposites, if you want to live.”</p>
<p>I: “That does not help. We also see each other in the opposite. We have grown tired of this game.”</p>
<p>S: “And so with life.”</p>
<p>I: “It seems to me that it depends on what you call life. Your notion of life has to do with climbing up and tearing down, with assertion and doubt, with impatient dragging around, 162/164 [Image 163]307 163/164 with hasty desire. You lack the absolute and its forbearing patience.”</p>
<p>S: “Quite right. My life bubbles and foams and stirs up turbulent waves, it consists of seizing and throwing away, ardent wishing and restlessness. That is life, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>I: “But the absolute also lives.”</p>
<p>S: “That is no life. It is a standstill or as good as a standstill, or rather: it lives interminably slowly and wastes thousands of years, just like the miserable condition that you have created.”</p>
<p>I: “You enlighten me. You are personal life, but the apparent standstill is the forbearing life of eternity, the life of divinity! This time you have counseled me well. I will let you go. Farewell.”</p>
<p>[HI 164] Satan crawls deftly like a mole back into his hole again. The symbol of the trinity and its entourage rise up in peace and equanimity to Heaven. I thank you, serpent, for hauling up the right one for me. Everyone understands his words, since they are personal. We can live again, a long life. We can waste thousands of years.</p>
<p>[HI 164/2] [2] Where to begin, oh Gods? In suffering or in joy, or in the mixed feeling lying between? The beginning is always the smallest, it begins in nothing. If I begin there, I see the little drop of “something” that falls into the sea of nothingness. It is forever about beginning again down where the nothingness widens itself to unrestricted freedom.308 Nothing has happened yet, the world has yet to begin, the sun is not yet born, the watery firmament has not been separated,309 we have not yet climbed onto the shoulders of our fathers, since our fathers have not yet become. They have only just died and rest in the womb of our bloodthirsty Europe.</p>
<p>We stand in the vastness, wed to the serpent, and consider which stone could be the foundation stone of the building, 164/165 which we do not yet know. The most ancient? It is suitable as a symbol. We want something graspable. We are weary of the webs that the day weaves and the night unpicks. The devil is probably supposed to create it, that paltry partisan with sham understanding and greedy hands? He emerged from the lump of manure in which the Gods had secured their eggs. I would like to kick the garbage away from me, if the golden seed were not in the vile heart of the misshapen form.</p>
<p>Arise then, son of darkness and stench! How firmly you cling to the rubble and waste of the eternal cesspit! I do not fear you, though I hate you, you brother of everything reprehensible in me. Today, you shall be forged with heavy hammers so that the gold of the Gods will spray out of your body. Your time is over, your years are numbered, and today your day of judgment has gone to smithereens. May your casings burst asunder, with our hands we wish to take hold of your seed, the golden one, and free it from slithery mud. May you freeze, devil, since we will cold-forge you. Steel is harder than ice. You shall fit into our form, you thief of the divine marvel, you mother ape, you who stuff your body with the egg of the Gods and thereby make yourself weighty. Hence we curse you, though not because of you, but for the sake of the golden seed.</p>
<p>What serviceable forms rise from your body, you thieving abyss! These appear as elemental spirits, dressed in wrinkled garb, Cabiri, with delightful misshapen forms, young and yet old, dwarfish, shriveled, unspectacular bearers of secret arts, possessors of ridiculous wisdom, first formations of the unformed gold, worms that crawl from the liberated egg of the Gods, incipient ones, unborn, still invisible. What should your appearance be to us? What new arts do you bear up from the inaccessible treasure chamber, the sun yoke from the egg of the Gods? You still have roots in the soil like plants and you are animal faces 165/166 of the human body; you are foolishly sweet, uncanny, primordial, and earthly. We cannot grasp your essence, you gnomes, you object-souls. You have your origin in the lowest. Do you want to become giants, you Tom Thumbs? Do you belong to the followers of the son of the earth? Are you the earthly feet of the Godhead? What do you want? Speak!310</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “We come to greet you as the master of the lower nature.”</p>
<p>I: “Are you speaking to me? Am I your master?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “You were not, but you are now.”</p>
<p>I: “So you declare. And so be it. Yet what should I do with your following?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “We carry what is not to be carried from below to above. We are the juices that rise secretly, not by force, but sucked out of inertia and affixed to what is growing. We know the unknown ways and the inexplicable laws of living matter. We carry up what slumbers in the earthly, what is dead and yet enters into the living. We do this slowly and easily, what you do in vain in your human way. We complete what is impossible for you.”</p>
<p>I: “What should I leave to you? Which troubles can I transfer to you? What should I not do, and what do you do better?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “You forget the lethargy of matter. You want to pull up with your own force what can only rise slowly, ingesting itself, affixed to itself from within. Spare yourself the trouble, or you will disturb our work.”</p>
<p>I: “Should I trust you, you untrustworthy ones, you slaves and slave souls? Get to work. Let it be so.”</p>
<p>311[HI 166] “It seems to me that I gave you a long time. Neither did I descend to you nor did I disturb your work. I lived in the light of day and did the work of the day. What did you do?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “We hauled things up, we built. We placed stone upon stone. Now you stand on solid ground.”</p>
<p>I: “I feel the ground more solid. I stretch upward.”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “We forged a flashing 166/167 sword for you, with which you can cut the knot that entangles you.”</p>
<p>I: “I take the sword firmly in my hand. I lift it for the blow.”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “We also place before you the devilish, skillfully twined knot that locks and seals you. Strike, only sharpness will cut through it.”</p>
<p>I: “Let me see it, the great knot, all wound round! Truly a masterpiece of inscrutable nature, a wily natural tangle of roots grown through one another! Only Mother Nature, the blind weaver, could work such a tangle! A great snarled ball and a thousand small knots, all artfully tied, intertwined, truly, a human brain! Am I seeing straight? What did you do? You set my brain before me! Did you give me a sword so that its flashing sharpness slices through my brain? What were you thinking of?”312</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “The womb of nature wove the brain, the womb of the earth gave the iron. So the Mother gave you both: entanglement and severing.”</p>
<p>I: “Mysterious! Do you really want to make me the executioner of my own brain?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “It befits you as the master of the lower nature. Man is entangled in his brain and the sword is also given to him to cut through the entanglement.”</p>
<p>I: “What is the entanglement you speak of?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “The entanglement is your madness, the sword is the overcoming of madness.”313</p>
<p>I: “You offsprings of the devil, who told you that I am mad? You earth spirits, you roots of clay and excrement, are you not yourselves the root fibers of my brain? You polyp-snared rubbish, channels for juice knotted together, parasites upon parasites, all sucked up and deceived, secretly climbing up over one another by night, you deserve the flashing sharpness of my sword. You want to persuade me to cut through you? Are you contemplating self-destruction? How come nature gives birth to creatures that she herself wants to destroy?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “Do not hesitate. We need destruction since we ourselves are the entanglement. He who wishes to conquer new land 167/168 brings down the bridges behind him. Let us not exist anymore. We are the thousand canals in which everything also flows back again into its origin.”</p>
<p>I: “Should I sever my own roots? Kill my own people, whose king I am? Should I make my own tree wither? You really are the sons of the devil.”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “Strike, we are servants who want to die for their master.”</p>
<p>I: “What will happen if I strike?”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “Then you will no longer be your brain, but will exist beyond your madness. Do you not see, your madness is your brain, the terrible entanglement and intertwining in the connection of the roots, in the nets of canals, the confusion of fibers. Being engrossed in the brain makes you wild. Strike! He who finds the way rises up over his brain. You are a Tom Thumb in the brain, beyond the brain you gain the form of a giant. We are surely sons of the devil, but did you not forge us out of the hot and dark? So we have something of its nature and of yours. The devil says that everything that exists is also worthy, since it perishes. As sons of the devil we want destruction, but as your creatures we want our own destruction. We want to rise up in you through death. We are roots that suck up from all sides. Now you have everything that you need, therefore chop us up, tear us out.”</p>
<p>I: “Will I miss you as servants? As a master I need slaves.”</p>
<p>The Cabiri: “The master serves himself.”</p>
<p>I: “You ambiguous sons of the devil, these words are your undoing. May my sword strike you, this blow shall be valid forever.”</p>
<p>The Cabiri “Woe, woe! What we feared, what we desired, has come to pass.”</p>
<p>168/171 [Image 169] 169/171 [HI 171] I set foot on new land. Nothing brought up should flow back. No one shall tear down what I have built. My tower is of iron and has no seams. The devil is forged into the foundations. The Cabiri built it and the master builders were sacrificed with the sword on the battlements of the tower. Just as a tower surmounts the summit of a mountain on which it stands, so I stand above my brain, from which I grew. I have become hard and cannot be undone again. No more do I flow back. I am the master of my own self. I admire my mastery. I am strong and beautiful and rich. The vast lands and the blue sky have laid themselves before me and bowed to my mastery. I wait upon no one and no one waits upon me. I serve myself and I myself serve. Therefore I have what I need.314</p>
<p>My tower grew for several thousand years, imperishable. It does not sink back. But it can be built over and will be built over. Few grasp my tower, since it stands on a high mountain. But many will see it 171/172 and not grasp it. Therefore my tower will remain unused. No one scales its smooth walls. No one lands on its pointed roof. Only he who finds the entrance hidden in the mountain and rises up through the labyrinths of the innards can reach the tower, and the happiness of he who surveys things from there and he who lives from himself. This has been attained and created. It has not arisen from a patchwork of human thoughts, but has been forged from the glowing heat of the innards; the Cabiri themselves carried the matter to the mountain and consecrated the building with their own blood as the sole keepers of the mystery of its genesis. I built it out of the lower and upper beyond and not from the surface of the world. Therefore it is new and strange and towers over the plains inhabited by humans. This is the solid and the beginning.315</p>
<p>[HI 172] I have united with the serpent of the beyond. I have accepted everything beyond into myself. From this I have built my beginning. When this work was completed, I was pleased, and I felt curious to know what might still lie in my beyond. So I approached my serpent and asked her 172/173 amiably whether she would not like to creep over to bring me news of what was happening in the beyond. But the serpent was weary and said that she had no liking for this.</p>
<p>{4}[1] 316I: “I don’t want to force anything, but perhaps, who knows? We will still find out something useful.” For a while the serpent hesitated, then she disappeared into the depths. Soon I heard her voice: “I believe that I have reached Hell. There is a hanged man here.” A plain, ugly man with a contorted face stands before me. He has protruding ears and a hunchback. He said: “I am a poisoner who was condemned to the rope.”</p>
<p>I: “What did you do?”</p>
<p>He: “I poisoned my parents and my wife.”</p>
<p>I: “Why did you do that?”</p>
<p>He: “To honor God.”</p>
<p>I: “What? To honor God? What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>He: “First of all, everything that happens is for the honor of God, and secondly, I had my own ideas.”</p>
<p>I: “What went through your mind?”</p>
<p>He: “I loved them and wanted to transport them more quickly from a wretched life into eternal blessedness. I gave them a strong, too strong a nightcap.”</p>
<p>I: “And did this not lead you to find out what your own interest in this was?”</p>
<p>He: “I was now alone and very unhappy. I wanted to live for the sake of my two children, for whom I foresaw a better future. I was in better health than my wife, so 173/174 I wanted to live.”</p>
<p>I: “Did your wife agree to the murders?”</p>
<p>He: “No, she certainly would have consented, but she knew nothing of my intentions. Unfortunately, the murder was discovered and I was condemned to death.”</p>
<p>I: “Have you found your relatives again in the beyond?”</p>
<p>He: “That’s a strange and unlikely story. I suspect that I’m in Hell. Sometimes it seems as if my wife were here too, and sometimes I’m not sure, just as little as I’m sure of my own self.”</p>
<p>I: “What is it like? Tell me.”</p>
<p>He: “From time to time, she seems to speak to me and I reply. But we haven’t spoken about either the murder or our children until now. We only speak together here and there, and only about trivial things, small matters from our earlier daily life, but completely impersonal, as if we no longer had anything to do with each other. But the true nature of things eludes me. I see even less of my parents; I believe that I have yet to meet my mother. My father was here once and said something about his tobacco pipe, which he had lost somewhere.”</p>
<p>I: “But how do you pass your time?”</p>
<p>He: “I believe that there is no time with us, so there is none to spend. Nothing at all happens.”</p>
<p>I: “Isn’t that 174/175 extremely boring?”</p>
<p>He: “Boring? I’ve never thought about it like that. Boring? Perhaps, but there’s nothing interesting. In actual fact, it’s pretty much all the same.”</p>
<p>I: “Doesn’t the devil ever torment you?”</p>
<p>He: “The devil? I’ve seen nothing of him.”</p>
<p>I: “You come from the beyond and yet you have nothing to report? I find that hard to believe.”</p>
<p>He: “When I still had a body, I often thought that surely it would be interesting to speak to one of the dead. But now the prospect means nothing much to me. As I said, everything here is impersonal and purely matter of fact. As far as I know, that’s what they say.”</p>
<p>I: “That is bleak. I assume that you are in the deepest Hell.”</p>
<p>He: “I don’t care. I guess I can go now, can’t I? Farewell.”</p>
<p>Suddenly he vanished. But I turned to the serpent317 and said: “What should this boring guest from the beyond mean?”</p>
<p>S: “I met him over there, stumbling around restlessly like so many others. I chose him as the next best. He strikes me as a good example.”</p>
<p>I: “But is the beyond so colorless?”</p>
<p>S: “It seems so; there is nothing but motion, when I make my way over there. Everything merely surges back and forth in a shadowy way. There is nothing personal whatsoever.”</p>
<p>I: “What is it, then, with this damned personal quality? Satan recently made 175/176 a strong impression on me, as if he were the quintessence of the personal.”</p>
<p>S: “Of course he would, since he is the eternal adversary, and because you can never reconcile personal life with absolute life.”</p>
<p>I: “Can’t one unite these opposites?”</p>
<p>S: “They are not opposites, but simply differences. Just as little as you make the day the opposite of the year or the bushel the opposite of the cubit.”</p>
<p>I: “That’s enlightening, but somewhat boring.”</p>
<p>S: “As always, when one speaks of the beyond. It goes on withering away, particularly since we have balanced the opposites and married. I believe the dead will soon become extinct.”</p>
<p>[HI 176] [2] The devil is the sum of the darkness of human nature. He who lives in the light strives toward being the image of God; he who lives in the dark strives toward being the image of the devil. Because I wanted to live in the light, the sun went out for me when I touched the depths. It was dark and serpentlike. I united myself with it and did not overpower it. I took my part of the humiliation and subjugation upon myself, in that I took on the nature of the serpent.</p>
<p>If I had 176/177 not become like the serpent, the devil, the quintessence of everything serpentlike, would have held this bit of power over me. This would have given the devil a grip and he would have forced me to make a pact with him just as he also cunningly deceived Faust.318 But I forestalled him by uniting myself with the serpent, just as a man unites with a woman.</p>
<p>So I took away from the devil the possibility of influence, which only ever passes through one’s own serpenthood,319 which one commonly assigns to the devil instead of oneself. Mephistopheles is Satan, taken with my serpenthood. Satan himself is the quintessence of evil, naked and therefore without seduction, not even clever, but pure negation without convincing force. Thus I resisted his destructive influence and grasped him and fettered him firmly. His descendants served me and I sacrificed them with the sword.</p>
<p>Thus I built a firm structure. Through this I myself gained stability and duration and could withstand the fluctuations of the personal. Therefore the immortal in me is saved. Through drawing the darkness from my beyond over into the day, I emptied my beyond. Therefore the demands of the dead disappeared, as they were satisfied.</p>
<p>177/178 I am no longer threatened by the dead, since I accepted their demands though accepting the serpent. But through this I have also taken over something of the dead into my day. Yet it was necessary, since death is the most enduring of all things, that which can never be canceled out. Death gives me durability and solidity. So long as I wanted to satisfy only my own demands, I was personal and therefore living in the sense of the world. But when I recognized the demands of the dead in me and satisfied them, I gave up my earlier personal striving and the world had to take me for a dead man. For a great cold comes over whoever in the excess of his personal striving has recognized the demands of the dead and seeks to satisfy them.</p>
<p>While he feels as if a mysterious poison has paralyzed the living quality of his personal relations, the voices of the dead remain silent in his beyond; the threat, the fear, and the restlessness cease. For everything that previously lurked hungrily in him no longer lives with him in his day. His life is beautiful and rich, since he is himself.</p>
<p>But whoever always wants only the fortune of others is ugly, since he 178/179 cripples himself. A murderer is one who wants to force others to blessedness, since he kills his own growth. A fool is one who exterminates his love for the sake of love. Such a one is personal to the other. His beyond is gray and impersonal. He forces himself upon others; therefore he is cursed into forcing himself upon himself in a cold nothingness. He who has recognized the demands of the dead has banished his ugliness to the beyond. He no longer greedily forces himself upon others, but lives alone in beauty and speaks with the dead. But there comes the day when the demands of the dead also are satisfied. If one then still perseveres in solitude, beauty fades into the beyond and the wasteland comes over onto this side. A black stage comes after the white, and Heaven and Hell are forever there.320</p>
<p>{5}[1] [HI 179] Now that I had found the beauty in me and with myself, I spoke to my serpent321: “I look back as onto a work that has been accomplished.”</p>
<p>Serpent: “Nothing is accomplished yet.”</p>
<p>I: “What do you mean? Not accomplished?”</p>
<p>Se: “This is only the beginning.”</p>
<p>I: “I think you are lying.”</p>
<p>Se: “Whom are you quarreling with? Do you know better?”</p>
<p>I: “I know 179/180 nothing, but I’d already gotten used to the idea that we had reached a goal, at least a temporary one. If even the dead are about to become extinct, what else is going to happen?”</p>
<p>Se: “But then the living must first begin to live.”</p>
<p>I: “This remark could certainly be deeply meaningful, but it seems to be nothing but a joke.”</p>
<p>Se: “You are getting impertinent. I’m not joking. Life has yet to begin.”</p>
<p>I: “What do you mean by life?”</p>
<p>Se: “I say, life has yet to begin. Didn’t you feel empty today? Do you call that life?”</p>
<p>I: “What you say is true, but I try to put as good a face as I can on everything and to settle for things.”</p>
<p>Se: “That might be quite comfortable. But you really ought to make much higher demands.”</p>
<p>I: “That I dread. I will certainly not assume that I could satisfy my own demands, but neither do I think that you are capable of satisfying them. However, it might be that once again I’m not trusting you enough. I suppose that might be so because I’ve drawn closer to you in human terms and find you so urbane.”</p>
<p>Se: “That proves nothing. Just don’t assume that somehow you could ever grasp me and embody me.”</p>
<p>I: “So, what should it be? I’m ready.”</p>
<p>Se: “You are entitled to a reward for 180/181 what has been accomplished so far.”</p>
<p>I: “A sweet thought, that payment could be made for this.”</p>
<p>Se: “I give you payment in images. Behold:”</p>
<p>[H1 181] Elijah and Salome! The cycle is completed and the gates of the mysteries have opened again. Elijah leads Salome, the seeing one, by the hand. She blushes and lowers her eyes while lovingly batting her eyelids.</p>
<p>E: “Here, I give you Salome. May she be yours.”</p>
<p>I: “For God’s sake, what should I do with Salome? I am already married and we are not among the Turks.”322</p>
<p>E: “You helpless man, how ponderous you are. Is this not a beautiful gift? Is her healing not your doing? Won’t you accept her love as the well-deserved payment for your trouble?”</p>
<p>I: “It seems to me a rather strange gift, more burden than joy. I am happy that Salome is thankful to me and loves me. I love her too—somewhat. Incidentally, the care I afforded her, was, literally, pressed out of me, rather than something I gave freely and intentionally. If my partly unintentional 181/182 ordeal has had such a good outcome, I’m already completely satisfied.”</p>
<p>Salome to Elijah: “Leave him, he is a strange man. Heaven knows what his motives are, but he seems to be serious. I’m not ugly and surely I’m generally desirable.”</p>
<p>Salome to me: “Why do you refuse me? I want to be your maid and serve you. I will sing and dance before you, fend off people for you, comfort you when you are sad, laugh with you when you are happy. I will carry all your thoughts in my heart. I will kiss the words that you speak to me. I will pick roses for you each day and all my thoughts will wait upon you and surround you.”</p>
<p>I: “I thank you for your love. It is beautiful to hear you speak of love. It is music and old, far-off homesickness. Look, my tears are falling because of your good words. I want to kneel before you and kiss your hands a hundred times, because they want to give me love. You speak so beautifully of love. One can never hear enough of love being spoken.”</p>
<p>Sal: “Why only speak? I want to be yours, utterly and completely yours.”</p>
<p>I: “You are like the serpent that coiled around me and pressed out my blood.”323 182/183 Your sweet words wind around me and I stand like someone crucified.”</p>
<p>Sal: “Why still crucified?”</p>
<p>I: “Don’t you see that unrelenting necessity has flung me onto the cross? It is impossibility that lames me.”</p>
<p>Sal: “Don’t you want to break through necessity? Is what you call a necessity really one?”324</p>
<p>I: “Listen, I doubt that it is your destiny to belong to me. I do not want to intervene in your utterly singular life, since I can never help you to lead it to an end. And what do you gain if one day I must lay you aside like a worn garment?”</p>
<p>Sal: “Your words are terrible. But I love you so much that I could also lay myself aside when your time has come.”</p>
<p>I: “I know that it would be the greatest torment for me to let you go away. But if you can do this for me, I can also do it for you. I would go on without lament, since I have not forgotten the dream where I saw my body lying on sharp needles and a bronze wheel rolling over my breast, crushing it. I must think of this dream whenever I think of love. If it must be, I am ready.”</p>
<p>Sal: “I don’t want such a sacrifice. I want to bring you joy. Can I not be joy to you?”</p>
<p>I: “I don’t know, perhaps, 183/184 perhaps not.”</p>
<p>Sal: “So then at least try.”</p>
<p>I: “The attempt is the same as the act. Such attempts are costly.”</p>
<p>Sal: “Won’t you bear the cost for my sake?”</p>
<p>I: “I’m rather too weak, too exhausted after what I have suffered because of you, still to be able to undertake further tasks for you. I would be overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Sal: “If you don’t want to accept me, then surely I cannot accept you?”</p>
<p>I: “It’s not a matter of acceptance; if it’s about anything in particular, it’s about giving.”</p>
<p>Sal: “But I do give myself to you. Just accept me.”</p>
<p>I: “As if that would settle the matter! But being entangled with love! Simply thinking about it is dreadful.”</p>
<p>Sal: “So you really demand that I be and not be at the same time. That is impossible. What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>I: “I lack the strength to hoist another fate onto my shoulders. I have enough to carry.”</p>
<p>Sal: “But what if I help you bear this load?”</p>
<p>I: “How can you? You’d have to carry me, an untamed burden. Shouldn’t I have to carry it myself?”</p>
<p>E: “You speak the truth. May each one carry his load. He who wants to burden others with his baggage is their slave.325 It is not too difficult for anyone to lug themselves.”</p>
<p>Sal: “But father, couldn’t I help him bear part of his burden?”</p>
<p>E: “Then he’d be your slave.” 184/185</p>
<p>Sal: “Or my master and ruler.”</p>
<p>I: “That I shall not be. You should be a free being. I can bear neither slaves nor masters. I long for men.”</p>
<p>Sal: “Am I not a human being?”</p>
<p>I: “Be your own master and your own slave, do not belong to me but to yourself. Do not bear my burden, but your own. Thus you leave me my human freedom, a thing that’s worth more to me than the right of ownership over another person.”</p>
<p>Sal: “Are you sending me away?”</p>
<p>I: “I’m not sending you away. You must not be far from me. But give to me out of your fullness, not your longing. I cannot satisfy your poverty just as you cannot still my longing. If your harvest is rich, send me some fruit from your garden. If you suffer from abundance, I will drink from the brimming horn of your joy. I know that that will be a balm for me. I can satisfy myself only at the table of the satisfied, not at the empty bowls of those who yearn. I will not steal my payment. You possess nothing, so how can you give? Insofar as you give, you demand. Elijah, old man, listen: you have a strange gratitude. Do not give away your daughter, but set her 185/186 on her own feet. She would like to dance, to sing or play the lute before people, and she would like their flashing coins thrown before her feet. Salome, I thank you for your love. If you really love me, dance before the crowd, please people so that they praise your beauty and your art. And if you have a rich harvest, throw me one of your roses through the window, and if the fount of your joy overflows, dance and sing to me once more. I long for the joy of men, for their fullness and freedom and not their neediness.”</p>
<p>Sal: “What a hard and incomprehensible man you are.”</p>
<p>E: “You have changed since I last saw you. You speak another language, one that sounds foreign to me.”</p>
<p>I: “My dear old man, I’d like to believe that you find me changed. But you too seem to have changed. Where is your serpent?”</p>
<p>E: “She has gone astray. I believe she was stolen. Since then things have been somewhat gloomy with us. Therefore I would have been happy if you had at least accepted my daughter.”</p>
<p>I: “I know where your serpent is. I have her. We fetched her from the underworld. She 186/187 gave me hardness, wisdom, and magical power. We need her in the upperworld, since otherwise the underworld would have had the advantage, to our detriment.”</p>
<p>E: “Away with you, accursed robber, may God punish you.”</p>
<p>I: “Your curse is powerless. Whoever possesses the serpent cannot be touched by curses. No, be sensible, old man: whoever possesses wisdom is not greedy for power. Only the man who has power declines to use it. Do not cry, Salome, fortune is only what you yourself create and not what comes to you. Be gone, my unhappy friends, the night grows late. Elijah, expunge the false gleam of power from your wisdom, and you, Salome, for the sake of our love, do not forget to dance.”</p>
<p>[2]326 When everything was completed in me, I unexpectedly returned to the mysteries, to that first sight of the otherworldly powers of the spirit and desire. Just as I had achieved pleasure in myself and power over myself, Salome had lost pleasure in herself but learned love for the other, and Elijah had lost the power of his wisdom but he had learned to recognize the spirit of the other. Salome thus lost the power of temptation and has 187/188 become love. As I have won pleasure in myself, I also want love for myself. But that really would be too much and would bind me like an iron ring that would stifle me. I accepted Salome as pleasure, and reject her as love. But she wants to be with me. How, then, should I also have love for myself? Love, I believe, belongs to others. But my love wants to be with me. I dread it. May the power of my thinking push it from me, into the world, into things, into men. For something should join men together, something should be a bridge. It is the most difficult temptation, if even my love wants me! Mysteries, open your curtains again! I want to wage this battle to its end. Come here, serpent of the dark abyss.</p>
<p>{6} 327[1] I hear Salome still crying. What does she want, or what do I still want? It’s a damnable payment you have given to me, a payment that one cannot touch without sacrifice. One that requires even greater sacrifice once one has touched it.</p>
<p>Serpent:328 “Do you mean to live without sacrifice? Life must cost you something, mustn’t it?”</p>
<p>I: “I have, I believe, already paid. I have rejected Salome. Is that not sacrifice enough?”</p>
<p>Se: “Too little for you. As has been said, you are allowed to make demands of yourself.”</p>
<p>I: “You mean well with your damned logic: demanding in sacrifice? That 188/189 isn’t what I understood. My error has obviously been to my own benefit. Tell me, isn’t it enough if I force my feeling into the background?”</p>
<p>Se: “You’re not forcing your feeling into the background at all; rather it suits you much better not to agonize further over Salome.”</p>
<p>I: “If you’re speaking the truth, it’s quite bad. Is that why Salome is still crying?”</p>
<p>Se: “Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>I: “But what is to be done?”</p>
<p>Se: “Oh, you want to act? One can also think.”</p>
<p>I: “But what is there to think? I confess that I know nothing to think here. Perhaps you have advice. I have the feeling that I must soar over my own head. I can’t do that. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Se: “I think nothing and have no advice either.”</p>
<p>I: “So ask the beyond, go to Heaven or Hell, perhaps there is advice there.”</p>
<p>Se: “I am being pulled upward.”</p>
<p>Then the serpent turned into a small white bird which soared into the clouds where she disappeared. My gaze followed her for a long time.329</p>
<p>Bird: “Do you hear me? I’m far off now. Heaven is so far away. Hell is much nearer the earth. I found something for you, a discarded crown. It lay on a street in the immeasurable space of Heaven, a golden crown.”</p>
<p>And now it already lies in330189/<em>Draft</em> my hand, a golden royal crown, with lettering incised within; what does it say? “Love never ends.”331 A gift from Heaven. But what does it mean?</p>
<p>B: “Here I am, are you satisfied?”</p>
<p>I: “Partially—at any rate I thank you for this meaningful gift. But it is mysterious, and your gift makes me well-nigh suspicious.”</p>
<p>B: “But the gift comes from Heaven, you know.”</p>
<p>I: “It’s certainly very beautiful, but you know very well what we have grasped of Heaven and Hell.”</p>
<p>B: “Don’t exaggerate. After all, there is a difference between Heaven and Hell. I certainly believe, to judge from what I have seen, that just as little happens in Heaven as in Hell, though probably in another way. Even what does not occur cannot occur in a particular way.”</p>
<p>I: “You speak in riddles that could make one ill if one took them to heart. Tell me, what do you make of the crown?”</p>
<p>B: “What do I make of it? Nothing. It truly speaks for itself.”</p>
<p>I: “You mean, through the inscription it bears?”</p>
<p>B: “Precisely; I presume that makes sense to you?”</p>
<p>I: “To some extent, I suppose. But that keeps the question awfully in suspense.”</p>
<p>B: “Which is how it is meant to be.”</p>
<p>Now the bird suddenly turned into the serpent again.332</p>
<p>I: “You’re unnerving.”</p>
<p>Serpent:333 “Only for him who isn’t in agreement with me.”</p>
<p>I: “That I am certainly not. But how could one? To hang in the air in such a way is gruesome.”</p>
<p>Se: “Is this sacrifice too difficult for you? You must also be able to hang if you want to solve problems. Look at Salome!”</p>
<p>I, to Salome: “I see, Salome, that you are still weeping. You are not yet done for. I hover and curse my hovering. I am hanging for your sake and for mine. First I was crucified, now I’m simply hanging—which is less noble, but no less agonizing.334 Forgive me, for wanting to do you in; I thought of saving you as I did when I healed your blindness through my self-sacrifice. Perhaps I must be decapitated a third time for your sake, like your earlier friend John, who brought us the Christ of agony. Are you insatiable? Do you still see no way to become reasonable?”</p>
<p>Sal: “My beloved, what can I do for you? I have utterly forsaken you.”</p>
<p>I: “So why are you still crying? You know I can’t bear seeing you in tears.”</p>
<p>Sal: “I thought that you were invulnerable since you possessed the black serpent rod.”</p>
<p>I: “The effect of the rod seems doubtful to me. But in one respect it does help me: at least I do not suffocate, although I have been strung up. The magic rod apparently helps me bear the hanging, surely a gruesome good deed and aid. Don’t you at least want to cut the cord?”</p>
<p>Sal: “How can I? You are hanging too high.335 High on the summit of the tree of life where I cannot reach. Can’t you help yourself, you knower of serpent wisdom?”</p>
<p>I: “Must I go on hanging for long?”</p>
<p>Sal: “Until you have devised help for yourself.”</p>
<p>I: “So at least tell me what you think of the crown that the bird of my soul fetched for me from Heaven.”</p>
<p>Sal: “What are you saying? The crown? You have the crown? Lucky one, what are you complaining about?”</p>
<p>I: “A hanged king would like to change places with every blessed beggar on the country road who has not been hanged.”</p>
<p>Sal (ecstatic): “The crown! You have the crown!”</p>
<p>I: “Salome, take pity on me. What is it with the crown?”</p>
<p>Sal (ecstatic): “The crown—you are to be crowned! What blessedness for me and you!”</p>
<p>I: “Alas, what do you want with the crown? I can’t understand it and I’m suffering unspeakable torment.”</p>
<p>Sal (cruelly): “Hang until you understand.”</p>
<p>I remain silent and hang high above the ground on the swaying branch of the divine tree, for whose sake the original ancestors could not avoid sin. My hands are bound and I am completely helpless. So I hang for three days and three nights. From where should help come? There sits my bird, the serpent, which has put on her white feather dress.</p>
<p>Bird: “We’ll fetch help from the clouds trailing above your head, when nothing else is of help to us.”</p>
<p>I: “You want to fetch help from the clouds? How is that possible?”</p>
<p>B: “I will go and try.”</p>
<p>The bird swings off like a rising lark, becomes smaller and smaller, and finally disappears in the thick gray veil of clouds covering the sky. My gaze follows her longingly and I make out nothing more than the endless gray cloudy sky above me, impenetrably gray, harmoniously gray and unreadable. But the writing on the crown—that is legible. “Love never ends” —does that mean eternal hanging? I was not wrong to be suspicious when my bird brought the crown, the crown of eternal life, the crown of martyrdom—ominous things that are dangerously ambiguous.</p>
<p>I am weary, weary not only of hanging but of struggling after the immeasurable. The mysterious crown lies far below my feet on the ground, winking gold. I do not hover, no, I hang, or rather worse, I am hanged between sky and earth—and do not tire of the state of hanging for I could indulge in it forever, but love never ends. Is it really true, shall love never end? If this was a blessed message to them, what is it for me?</p>
<p>“That depends entirely on the notion,” an old raven suddenly said, perched on a branch not far from me, awaiting the funeral meal, and immersed in philosophizing.</p>
<p>I: “Why does it depend entirely on the notion?”</p>
<p>Raven: “On your notion of love and the other.”</p>
<p>I: “I know, unlucky old bird, you mean heavenly and earthly love.336 Heavenly love would be utterly beautiful, but we are men, and, precisely because we are men, I’ve set my mind on being a complete and full-fledged man.”</p>
<p>R: “You’re an ideologue.”</p>
<p>I: “Dumb raven, be gone!”</p>
<p>There, very close to my face, a branch moves, a black serpent has coiled itself around it and looks at me with the blinding pearly shimmer of its eyes. Is it not my serpent?</p>
<p>I: “Sister, and black rod of magic, where do you come from? I thought that I saw you fly to Heaven as a bird and now you are here? Do you bring help?”</p>
<p>Serpent: “I am only my own half; I’m not one, but two; I’m the one and the other. I am here only as the serpentlike, the magical. But magic is useless here. I wound myself idly around this branch to await further developments. You can use me in life, but not in hanging. In the worst case, I’m ready to lead you to Hades. I know the way there.”</p>
<p>A black form condenses before me out of the air, Satan, with a scornful laugh. He calls to me: “See what comes from the reconciliation of opposites! Recant, and in a flash you’ll be down on the greening earth.”</p>
<p>I: “I won’t recant, I’m not stupid. If such is the outcome of all this, let it be the end.”</p>
<p>Se: “Where is your inconsistency? Please remember this important rule of the art of life.”</p>
<p>I: “The fact that I’m hanging here is inconsistency enough. I’ve lived inconsistently ad nauseam. What more do you want?”</p>
<p>Se: “Perhaps inconsistency in the right place?”</p>
<p>I: “Stop it! How should I know what the right and the wrong places are?”</p>
<p>Satan: “Whoever gets on in a sovereign way with the opposites knows left from right.”</p>
<p>I: “Be quiet, you’re an interested party. If only my white bird came back with help; I fear I’m growing weak.”</p>
<p>Se: “Don’t be stupid, weakness too is a way, magic makes good the error.”</p>
<p>Satan: “What, you’ve not yet once had the courage of weakness? You want to become a complete man—are men strong?”</p>
<p>I: “White bird of mine, I suppose you can’t find your way back? Did you get up and leave because you couldn’t live with me? Ah, Salome! There she comes. Come to me, Salome! Another night has passed. I didn’t hear you cry, but I hung and still hang.”</p>
<p>Sal: “I haven’t cried anymore, for good fortune and misfortune are balanced in me.”</p>
<p>I: “My white bird has left and has not yet returned. I know nothing and understand nothing. Does this have to do with the crown? Speak!”</p>
<p>Sal: “What should I say? Ask yourself.”</p>
<p>I: “I cannot. My brain is like lead, I can only whimper for help. I have no way of knowing whether everything is falling or standing still. My hope is with my white bird. Oh no, could it be that the bird means the same thing as hanging?”</p>
<p>Satan: “Reconciliation of the opposites! Equal rights for all! Follies!”</p>
<p>I: “I hear a bird chirping! Is that you? Have you come back?”</p>
<p>Bird: “If you love the earth, you are hanged; if you love the sky, you hover.”</p>
<p>I: “What is earth? What is sky?”</p>
<p>B: “Everything under you is the earth, everything above you is the sky. You fly if you strive for what is above you; you are hanged if you strive for what is below you.”</p>
<p>I: “What is above me? What is beneath me?”</p>
<p>B: “Above you is what is before and over you; beneath you is what comes back under you.”</p>
<p>I: “And the crown? Solve the riddle of the crown for me!”</p>
<p>B: “The crown and serpent are opposites, and are one. Did you not see the serpent that crowned the head of the crucified?”</p>
<p>I: “What, I don’t understand you.”</p>
<p>B: “What words did the crown bring you? ‘Love never ends’—that is the mystery of the crown and the serpent.”</p>
<p>I: “But Salome? What should happen to Salome?”</p>
<p>B: “You see, Salome is what you are. Fly, and she will grow wings.”</p>
<p>The clouds part, the sky is full of the crimson sunset of the completed third day.337 The sun sinks into the sea, and I glide with it from the top of the tree toward the earth. Softly and peacefully night falls.</p>
<p>[2] Fear has befallen me. Whom did you carry to the mountain, you Cabiri? And whom have I sacrificed in you? You have piled me up yourselves, turning me into a tower on inaccessible crags, turning me into my church, my monastery, my place of execution, my prison. I am locked up and condemned within myself. I am my own priest and congregation, judge and judged, God and human sacrifice.</p>
<p>What a work you have accomplished, Cabiri! You have given birth to a cruel law from the chaos that cannot be revoked. It is understood and accepted.</p>
<p>The completion of the secret operation approaches. What I saw I described in words to the best of my ability. Words are poor, and beauty does not attend them. But is truth beautiful and beauty true?338</p>
<p>One can speak in beautiful words about love, but about life? And life stands above love. But love is the inescapable mother of life. Life should never be forced into love, but love into life. May love be subject to torment, but not life. As long as love goes pregnant with life, it should be respected; but if it has given birth to life from itself, it has turned into an empty sheath and expires into transience.</p>
<p>I speak against the mother who bore me, I separate myself from the bearing womb.339 I speak no more for the sake of love, but for the sake of life.</p>
<p>The word has become heavy for me, and it barely wrestles itself free of the soul. Bronze doors have shut. fires have burned out and sunk into ashes. Wells have been drained and where there were seas there is dry land. My tower stands in the desert. Happy is he who can be a hermit in his own desert. He survives.</p>
<p>Not the power of the flesh, but of love, should be broken for the sake of life, since life stands above love. A man needs his mother until his life has developed. Then he separates from her. And so life needs love until it has developed, then it will cut loose from it. The separation of the child from the mother is difficult, but the separation of life from love is harder. Love seeks to have and to hold, but life wants more.</p>
<p>The beginning of all things is love, but the being of things is life.340 This distinction is terrible. Why, Oh spirit of the darkest depths, do you force me to say that whoever loves does not live and whoever lives does not love? I always get it backward! Should everything be turned into its opposite?341 Will there be a sea where ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ’s temple stands? Will his shady island sink into the deepest ground? Into the whirlpool of the withdrawing flood that earlier swallowed all peoples and lands? Will the bottom of the sea be where Ararat arises?342</p>
<p>What repulsive words do you mutter, you mute son of the earth? You want to sever my soul’s embrace? You, my son, do you thrust yourself between? Who are you? And who gives you the power? Everything that I strove for, everything I wrested from myself, do you want to reverse it again and destroy it? You are the son of the devil, to whom everything holy is inimical. You grow overpowering. You frighten me. Let me be happy in the embrace of my soul and do not disturb the peace of the temple.</p>
<p>Off with you, you pierce me with paralyzing force. For I do not want your way. Should I languidly fall at your feet? You devil and son of the devil, speak! Your silence is unbearable, and of awful stupidity.</p>
<p>I won my soul, and to what did she give birth for me? You, monster, a son, ha!—a frightful miscreant, a stammerer, a newt’s brain, a primordial lizard! You want to be king of the earth? You want to banish proud free men, bewitch beautiful women, break up castles, rip open the belly of old cathedrals? Dumb thing, a lazy bug-eyed frog that wears pond weed on his skull’s pate! And you want to call yourself my son? You’re no son of mine, but the spawn of the devil. The father of the devil entered into the womb of my soul and in you has become flesh.</p>
<p>I recognize you, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, you most cunning of all fraudsters! You have deceived me. You impregnated my maidenly soul with the terrible worm. ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, damned charlatan, you aped the mysteries for me, you lay the mantle of the stars on me, you played a Christ-fool’s comedy with me, you hanged me, carefully and ludicrously, in the tree just like Odin,343 you let me devise runes to enchant Salome—and meanwhile you procreated my soul with the worm, spew of the dust. Deception upon deception! Terrible devil trickery!</p>
<p>You gave me the force of magic, you crowned me, you clad me with the shimmer of power, that let me play a would-be Joseph father to your son. You lodged a puny basilisk in the nest of the dove.</p>
<p>My soul, you adulterous whore, you became pregnant with this bastard! I am dishonored; I, laughable father of the Antichrist! How I mistrusted you! And how poor was my mistrust, that it could not gauge the magnitude of this infamous act!</p>
<p>What do you break apart? You broke love and life in twain. From this ghastly sundering, the frog and the son of the frog come forth. Ridiculous—disgusting sight! Irresistible advent! They will sit on the banks of the sweet water and listen to the nocturnal song of the frogs, since their God has been born as a son of frogs.</p>
<p>Where is Salome? Where is the unresolvable question of love? No more questions, my gaze turned to the coming things, and Salome is where I am. The woman follows your strongest, not you. Thus she bears you your children, in both a good and a bad way.</p>
<p>{7}[1] As I stood so alone on the earth, which was covered by rain clouds and falling night, my serpent344 crept up to me and told me a story:</p>
<p>“Once upon a time there was a king and he had no children. But he would have liked to have a son. So he went to a wise woman who lived as a witch in the forest and confessed all his sins, as if she were a priest appointed by God. To this she said: ‘Dear King, you have done what you should not have done. But since it has come to pass, it has come to pass, and we will have to see how you can do it better in the future. Take a pound of otter lard, bury it in the earth, and let nine months pass. Then dig up that place again and see what you find.’ So the king went to his house, ashamed and saddened, because he had humiliated himself before the witch in the forest. Yet he listened to her advice, dug a hole in the garden at night, and placed a pot of otter lard in it, which he had obtained with some difficulty. Then he let nine months go by.</p>
<p>“After this time had passed he went again by night to the place where the pot lay buried and dug it up. To his great astonishment, he found a sleeping infant in the pot, though the lard had disappeared. He took out the infant and jubilantly brought it to his wife. She took it immediately to her breast and behold—her milk flowed freely. And so the child thrived and became great and strong. He grew into a man who was greater and stronger than all others. When the king’s son was twenty years old, he came before his father and said: ‘I know that you have produced me through sorcery and that I was not born as one of men. You have made me from the repentance of your sins and this has made me strong. I am born from no woman, which makes me clever. I am strong and clever and therefore I demand the crown of the realm from you.’ The old king was startled at his son’s knowledge, but even more by his impetuous longing for regal power. He remained silent and thought: ‘What has produced you? Otter lard. Who bore you? The womb of the earth. I drew you from a pot, a witch humiliated me.’ And he decided to let his son be killed secretly.</p>
<p>“But because his son was stronger than others, he feared him and therefore he wanted to take refuge in a trick. He went again to the sorceress in the forest and asked her for advice. She said: ‘Dear King, you confess no sin to me this time, because you want to commit a sin. I advise you to bury another pot with otter’s lard and leave it to lie in the earth for nine months. Then dig it out again and see what has happened.’ The king did what the sorceress advised him. And thenceforth his son became weaker and weaker, and when the king returned to the place where the pot lay after nine months, he could dig his son’s grave at the same time. He lay the dead one in the fosse beside the empty pot.</p>
<p>“But the king was saddened, and when he could no longer master his melancholy, he returned yet again to the sorceress one night and asked her for advice. She spoke to him: ‘Dear King, you wanted a son, but the son wanted to be king himself and also had the power and cleverness for it, and then you wanted your son no more. Because of this you lost your son. Why are you complaining? You have everything, dear King, that you wanted.’ But the king said: ‘You are right. I wanted it so. But I did not want this melancholy. Do you have any remedies against remorse?’ The sorceress spoke: ‘Dear King, go to your son’s grave, fill the pot again with otter’s lard, and after nine months see what you find in the pot.’ The king did this, as he had been commanded, and henceforth he became happy and did not know why.</p>
<p>“When the nine months had passed, he dug out the pot again; the body had disappeared, but in the pot there lay a sleeping infant, and he realized that the infant was his dead son. He took the infant to himself, and henceforth he grew as much in a week as other infants grow in a year. And when twenty weeks had passed, the son came before the father again and claimed his realm. But the father had learned from experience and already knew for a long time how everything would turn out. After the son had voiced his demand, the old king got up from his throne and embraced his son with tears of joy and crowned him king. And so the son, who had thus become king, was grateful to his father and held him in high esteem, as long as his father was granted life.”</p>
<p>But I spoke to my serpent: “In truth, my serpent, I didn’t know that you are also a teller of fairy tales. So tell me, how should I interpret your fairy tale?”</p>
<p>Se: “Imagine that you are the old king and have a son.”</p>
<p>I: “Who is the son?”</p>
<p>Se: “Well, I thought that you had just spoken of a son who doesn’t make you very happy.”</p>
<p>I: “What? You don’t mean—that I should crown him?”</p>
<p>Se: “Yes, who else?”</p>
<p>I: “That’s uncanny. But what about the sorceress?”</p>
<p>Se: “The sorceress is a motherly woman whose son you should be, since you are a child renewing himself in you.”</p>
<p>I: “Oh no, will it be impossible for me to be a man?”</p>
<p>Se: “Sufficient manhood, and beyond that fullness of childhood. Which is why you need the mother.”</p>
<p>I: “I’m ashamed to be a child.”</p>
<p>Se: “And thus you kill your son. A creator needs the mother, since you are not a woman.”</p>
<p>I: “This is a terrible truth. I thought and hoped that I could be a man in every way.”</p>
<p>Se: “You cannot do this for the sake of the son. To create means: mother and child.”</p>
<p>I: “The thought that I must remain a child is unbearable.”</p>
<p>Se: “For the sake of your son you must be a child and leave him the crown.”</p>
<p>I: “The thought that I must remain a child is humiliating and shattering.”</p>
<p>Se: “A salutary antidote against power!345 Don’t resist being a child, otherwise you resist your son,346 whom you want above all.”</p>
<p>I: “It’s true, I want the son and survival. But the price for this is high.”</p>
<p>Se: “The son stands higher. You are smaller and weaker than the son. That is a bitter truth, but it can’t be avoided. Don’t be defiant, children must be well-behaved.”</p>
<p>I: “Damned scorn!”</p>
<p>Se: “Man of mockery! I’ll have patience with you. My wells should flow for you and pour forth the drink of salvation, if all lands parch with thirst and everyone comes to you begging for the water of life. So subject yourself to the son.”</p>
<p>I: “Where am I going to take hold of the immeasurable? My knowledge and ability are poor, my power is not enough.”</p>
<p>At which the serpent curled up, gathered herself into knots and said: “Do not ask after the morrow, sufficient unto you is the day. You need not worry about the means. Let everything grow, let everything sprout; the son grows out of himself.”</p>
<p>[2] The myth commences, the one that need only be lived, not sung, the one that sings itself. I subject myself to the son, the one engendered by sorcery, the unnaturally born, the son of the frogs, who stands at the waterside and speaks with his fathers and listens to their nocturnal singing. Truly he is full of mysteries and superior in strength to all men. No man has produced him, and no woman has given birth to him.</p>
<p>The absurd has entered the age-old mother, and the son has grown in the deepest ground. He sprang up and was put to death. He rose again, was produced anew in the way of sorcery, and grew more swiftly than before. I gave him the crown that unites the separated. And so he unites the separated for me. I gave him the power and thus he commands, since he is superior in strength and cleverness to all others.</p>
<p>I did not give way to him willingly, but out of insight. No man binds Above and Below together. But he who did not grow like a man, and yet has the form of a man, is capable of binding them. My power is paralyzed, but I survive in my son. I set aside my concern that he may master the people. I am solitary, the people rejoice at him. I was powerful, now I am powerless. I was strong, now I am weak. Since then he has taken all the strength into himself. Everything has turned itself upside down for me.</p>
<p>I loved the beauty of the beautiful, the spirit of those rich in spirit, the strength of the strong; I laughed at the stupidity of the stupid, I despised the weakness of the weak, the meanness of the mean, and hated the badness of the bad. But now I must love the beauty of the ugly, the spirit of the foolish, and the strength of the weak. I must admire the stupidity of the clever, must respect the weakness of the strong and the meanness of the generous, and honor the goodness of the bad. Where does that leave mockery, contempt, and hatred?</p>
<p>They went over to the son as a token of power. His mockery is bloody, and how contemptuously his eyes flash! His hatred is a singing fire! Enviable one, you son of the Gods, how can one fail to obey you? He broke me in two, he cut me up. He yokes the separated. Without him I would fall apart, but my life went on with him. My love remained with me.</p>
<p>Thus I entered solitude with a black look on my face, full of resentment and outrage at my son’s dominion. How could my son arrogate my power? I went into my gardens and sat down in a lonely spot on rocks by the water, and brooded darkly. I called the serpent, my nocturnal companion, who lay with me on the rocks through many twilights, imparting her serpent wisdom. But then my son emerged from the water, great and powerful, the crown on his head, with a swirling lion’s mane, shimmering serpent skin covering his body; he said to me:347</p>
<p>{8} [1] “I come to you and demand your life.”</p>
<p>I: “What do you mean? Have you even become a God?”348</p>
<p>He: “I rise again, I had become flesh, now I return to eternal glitter and shimmer, to the eternal embers of the sun, and leave you your earthliness. You will remain with men. You have been in immortal company long enough. Your work belongs to the earth.”</p>
<p>I: “What a speech! Weren’t you wallowing in the earth and the underearth?”</p>
<p>He: “I had become man and beast, and now ascend again to my own country.”</p>
<p>I: “Where is your country?”</p>
<p>He: “In the light, in the egg, in the sun, in what is innermost and compressed, in the eternal longing embers. So rises the sun in your heart and streams out into the cold world.”</p>
<p>I: “How you transfigure yourself!”</p>
<p>He: “I want to vanish from your sight. You ought to live in darkest solitude, men—not Gods—should illumine your darkness.”</p>
<p>I: “How hard and solemn you are! I’d like to bathe your feet with my tears, dry them with my hair—I’m raving, am I a woman?”</p>
<p>He: “Also a woman, also a mother, pregnant. Giving birth awaits you.”</p>
<p>I: “Oh holy spirit, grant me a spark of your eternal light!”</p>
<p>He: “You are with child.”</p>
<p>I: “I feel the torment and the fear and the desolation of pregnant woman. Do you go from me, my God?”</p>
<p>He: “You have the child.”</p>
<p>I: “My soul, do you still exist? You serpent, you frog, you magically produced boy whom my hands buried; you ridiculed, despised, hated one who appeared to me in a foolish form? Woe betide those who have seen their soul and felt it with hands. I am powerless in your hand, my God!”</p>
<p>He: “The pregnant woman belongs to fate. Release me, I rise to the eternal realm.”</p>
<p>I: “Will I never hear your voice again? Oh damned deception! What am I asking? You’ll talk to me again tomorrow, you’ll chat over and over in the mirror.”</p>
<p>He: “Do not rail. I will be present and not present. You will hear and not hear me. I will be and not be.”</p>
<p>I: “You utter gruesome riddles.”</p>
<p>He: “Such is my language and to you I leave the understanding. No one besides you has your God. He is always with you, yet you see him in others, and thus he is never with you. You strive to draw to yourself those who seem to possess your God. You will come to see that they do not possess him, and that you alone have him. Thus you are alone among men—in the crowd and yet alone. Solitude in multitude—ponder this.”</p>
<p>I: “I suppose I ought to remain silent after what you have said, but I cannot; my heart bleeds when I see you go from me.”</p>
<p>He: “Let me go. I shall return to you in renewed form. Do you see the sun, how it sinks red into the mountains? This day’s work is accomplished, and a new sun returns. Why are you mourning the sun of today?”</p>
<p>I: “Must night fall?”</p>
<p>He: “Is it not mother of the day?”</p>
<p>I: “Because of this night I want to despair.”</p>
<p>He: “Why lament? It is fate. Let me go, my wings grow and the longing toward eternal light swells up powerfully in me. You can no longer stop me. Stop your tears and let me ascend with cries of joy. You are a man of the fields, think of your crops. I become light, like the bird that rises up into the skies of morning. Do not stop me, do not complain; already I hover, the cry of life escapes from me, I can no longer hold back my supreme pleasure. I must go up—it has happened, the last cord tears away, my wings bear me up. I dive up into the sea of light. You who are down there, you distant, twilight being—you fade from me.”</p>
<p>I: “Where have you gone? Something has happened. I am lamed. Has the God not left my sight?”</p>
<p>Where is the God?</p>
<p>What has happened?</p>
<p>How empty, how utterly empty! Should I proclaim to men how you vanished? Should I preach the gospel of godforsaken solitude?</p>
<p>Should we all go into the desert and strew ashes on our heads, since the God has left us?</p>
<p>I believe and accept that the God349 is something different from me.</p>
<p>He swung high with jubilant joy.</p>
<p>I remain in the night of pain.</p>
<p>No longer with the God,350 but alone with myself.</p>
<p>Now shut, you bronze doors I opened to the flood of devastation and murder brooding over the peoples, opened so as to midwife the God.</p>
<p>Shut, may mountains bury you and seas flow over you.351</p>
<p>I came to my self,352 a giddy and pitiful figure. My I! I didn’t want this fellow as my companion. I found myself with him. I’d prefer a bad woman or a wayward hound, but one’s own I—this horrifies me.</p>
<p>353An opus is needed, that one can squander decades on, and do it out of necessity. I must catch up with a piece of the Middle Ages—within myself. We have only finished the Middle Ages of—others. I must begin early, in that period when the hermits died out.354 Asceticism, inquisition, torture are close at hand and impose themselves. The barbarian requires barbaric means of education. My I, you are a barbarian. I want to live with you, therefore I will carry you through an utterly medieval Hell, until you are capable of making living with you bearable. You should be the vessel and womb of life, therefore I shall purify you.</p>
<p>The touchstone is being alone with oneself.</p>
<p>This is the way.355</p>
<p>1.<em>The Handwritten Draft</em> has: “The Adventures of the Wandering” (p. 353).</p>
<p>2.In his essay on Picasso in 1932, Jung described the paintings of schizophrenics—meaning here only those in which a psychic disturbance would probably produce schizoid symptoms, rather than people who suffered from this condition—as follows: “From a purely formal point of view, the main characteristic is one of <em>fragmentation</em>, which expresses itself in the so-called lines of fracture, that is, a type of psychic fissure which runs right through the picture” (<em>CW</em> 15, §208).</p>
<p>3.These passages in Latin from the Bible were cited by Jung in <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921) (from Luther’s <em>Bible</em>) and introduced with the following comments: “The form in which Christ presented the content of his unconscious to the world became accepted and was delared valid for all. Thereafter all individual fantasies became otiose and worthless, and were persecuted as heretical, as the fate of the Gnostic movement and of all later heresies testifies. The prophet Jeremiah is speaking just in this vein when he warns” (<em>CW</em> 6, §81).</p>
<p>4.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “<em>V The Great Wandering I. The Red One</em>” (p. 157).</p>
<p>5.This depicts Jung’s “I” in the opening scene of this fantasy.</p>
<p>6.The previous paragraph was added in the <em>Draft</em> (p. 167).</p>
<p>7.December 26, 1913.</p>
<p>8.Salerno is a town in southwest Italy, founded by the Romans. Jung may have been referring to the Academia Segreta, which was established in the 1540s and promoted alchemy.</p>
<p>9.The Sophists were Greek philosophers in the fourth and fifth centuries BCE, centered in Athens, and included figures such as Protagoras, Gorgias, and Hippias. They gave lectures and took on students for fees, and paid particular attention to teaching rhetoric. Plato’s attack in a number of dialogues gave rise to the modern negative connotation of the term as one who plays with words.</p>
<p>10.The <em>Draft</em> continues:” No one can flout the spiritual development of many centuries and reap what they have not sowed” (p. 172).</p>
<p>11.In Nietzsche’s <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Zarathustra admonishes the overcoming of the spirit of gravity, and urges “You Higher Men, the worst thing about you is: none of you has learned to dance as a man ought to dance—to dance beyond yourselves!” (“Of the higher men,” p. 306).</p>
<p>12.In a seminar in 1939, Jung discussed the historical transformation of the figure of the devil. He noted that “When he appears red, he is of a fiery, that is, passionate nature, and causes wantonness, hate, or unruly love”; see <em>Children’s Dreams: Notes from the Seminar Given in 1936–1940</em>, eds. Lorenz Jung and Maria Meyer-Grass, tr. Ernst Falzeder and Tony Woolfson (Princeton: Princeton University Press/Philemon Series, 2008), p.174.</p>
<p>13.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “You have heard from Faust about how commanding this kind of joy is” (p. 175). The reference is to Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>.</p>
<p>14.The <em>Draft</em> has: “As you have known from Faust, there are many who forget who they were because they let themselves be swept away” (p. 175).</p>
<p>15.Jung elaborated this point in 1928 while presenting the method of active imagination: “As against this, the scientific credo of our time has developed a superstitious phobia about fantasy. <em>But the real is what</em> <em>works</em>. The fantasies of the unconscious work—there can be no doubt about that” (<em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious, CW</em> 7, §353).</p>
<p>16.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Every attentive person knows their Hell, but not all know their devil. There are not only joyful devils, but also sad ones” (p. 178).</p>
<p>17.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “On a later adventure I discovered how seriousness suits the devil. While seriousness certainly makes him more dangerous for you, it doesn’t agree with him, believe me” (pp. 178–79).</p>
<p>18.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “With this newly gained joy I took off on adventures without knowing where the way would lead. I could have known, however, that the devil always tempts us first through women. While I might have had clever thoughts as a thinker, it was not so in life. There I was even fatuous and prejudiced. And so quite ready to be caught in a fox trap” (p. 179).</p>
<p>19.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has: “<em>Second Adventure</em>” (p. 383).</p>
<p>20.December 28, 1913.</p>
<p>21.Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> begins with the poet getting lost in a dark wood. There is a slip of paper in Jung’s copy by this page.</p>
<p>22.In “Wish fulfillment and symbolism in fairy tales” (1908), Jung’s colleague Franz Riklin argued that fairy tales were the spontaneous inventions of the primitive human soul and the general tendency to wish fulfillment (tr. W. A. White, <em>The Psychoanalytic Review</em> [1913], p. 95). In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido,</em> Jung viewed fairy tales and myths alike as representing primordial images. In his later work, he viewed them as expressions of archetypes, as in “On the archetypes of the collective unconscious” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §6). Jung’s pupil Marie-Louise von Franz developed the psychological interpretation of fairy tales in a series of works. See her <em>The Interpretation of Fairy Tales</em> (Boston: Shambala, 1996).</p>
<p>23.In “On the psychological aspects of the Kore figure” (1951), Jung described this episode as follows: “A lonely house in a wood, where an old scholar is living. Suddenly his daughter appears, a kind of ghost, complaining that people always only consider her as a fantasy” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §361). Jung commented (following his remarks concerning the Elijah and Salome episode above, note 212, p. 198) “Dream iii. presents the same theme, but on a more fairy tale-like plane. The anima is here characterized as a ghostly being” (Ibid., §373).</p>
<p>24.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “My friend, you learn nothing about my outer visible life. You only hear about my inner life, the counterpart of my outer life. If you therefore think that I have but my inner life and that is my only life, then you are mistaken. For you must know that your inner life does not become richer at the expense of your outer one, but poorer. If you do not live on the outside, you will not become richer within, but merely more burdened. This is not to your advantage and it is the beginning of evil. Likewise, your outer life will not become richer and more beautiful at the expense of your inner one, but only poorer and poorer. Balance finds the way” (p. 188).</p>
<p>25.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “I returned to my middle ages where I was still romantic, and there I experienced the adventure” (p. 190).</p>
<p>26.In 1921 in <em>Psychological Types</em>, Jung wrote: “A very feminine woman has a masculine soul, and a very masculine man has a feminine soul. The contrast is due to the fact that for example a man is not in all things wholly masculine, but also normally has certain feminine traits. The more masculine his outer attitude is, the more his feminine traits are obliterated: instead, they appear in the unconscious” (<em>CW</em> 6, §804). He designated the man’s feminine soul as the anima, and the woman’s masculine soul as the animus, and described how individuals projected their soul images onto members of the opposite sex (§ 805).</p>
<p>27.For Jung, the integration of the anima for the man and of the animus for the woman was necessary for the development of the personality. In 1928, he described this process, which required withdrawing the projections from members of the opposite sex, differentiating from them, and becoming conscious of them in <em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious</em>, part 2, ch. 2, <em>CW</em> 7, §296ff. See also <em>Aion</em> (1951), <em>CW</em> 9, 2, §20ff.</p>
<p>28.Instead of this phrase, the <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “But if he accepts the feminine in himself, he frees himself from slavery to woman” (p. 178).</p>
<p>29.Albrecht Dieterich noted: “Often enough popular belief deems the soul a bird from the start” (<em>Abraxas. Studien zur Religionsgeschichte des spätern Altertums</em> [Leipzig, 1891], p. 184).</p>
<p>30.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have: “Inasmuch I was this old man, buried in books and barren science, just and appraising, wresting grains of sand from the infinite desert, my [self] so-called soul, namely my inner self, suffered greatly” (p. 180).</p>
<p>31.<em>Human, All Too Human</em> was the title of a work of Nietzsche’s, published in three installments from 1878. He described psychological observation as the reflection on the “human, all too human” (tr. R. J. Hollingdale [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996], p. 31).</p>
<p>32.In October 1916, in his talk before the Psychological Club on “Individuation and Collectivity,” Jung noted that through individuation, “the individual must now consolidate himself by cutting himself off from the divine and become wholly himself. Thereby and at the same time he also separates himself from society. Outwardly he plunges into solitude, but inwardly into hell, distance from God” (<em>CW</em> 18, §1103).</p>
<p>33.In Dante’s <em>Commedia,</em> Hell has nine levels.</p>
<p>34.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has: “<em>Third Adventure</em>” (p. 440). The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has “The Rogue,” which is then covered over with paper (p. 186).</p>
<p>35.December 29, 1913.</p>
<p>36.The emblem of the city of Zürich bears this motif, showing the late-third-century martyrs Felix, Regula, and Exuperantius.</p>
<p>37.This appears to be a reference to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in Daniel 3, whom Nebuchadnezzar ordered to be placed into a furnace for refusing to worship the golden idol that he had erected. They were unscathed by the fire, which led Nebuchadnezzar to decree that he would cut up anyone who henceforth spoke against their God.</p>
<p>38.The <em>Acta Sanctorum</em> is a collection of the lives and legends of the saints arranged according to their feast days. Published by Jesuits in Belgium known as the Bollandist Fathers, it began in 1643 and ran to sixty-three folio volumes.</p>
<p>39.In <em>Wilhelm Tell</em> (1805), Friedrich Schiller dramatized the revolt of the Swiss cantons against the rule of the Austrian Habsburg empire at the beginning of the fourteenth century, which led to the founding of the Swiss confederation. In act 4, scene 3, Wilhelm Tell kills Gessler, the imperial representative. Stüssi, the ranger, announces, “The tyrant of the land is dead. From now henceforth we suffer no oppression. We are free men” (tr. W. Mainland [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1973], p. 119).</p>
<p>40.In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung cited beliefs in different cultures that the moon was the gathering place of departed souls (<em>CW</em> B, §496). In <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em> (1955/56), Jung commented on this motif in alchemy (<em>CW</em> 14, §155).</p>
<p>41.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “I accepted the rogue, and lived and died with him. Since I lived him, I became his murderer, since we kill what we live” (p. 217).</p>
<p>42.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> continues: “from death” (p. 200).</p>
<p>43.(First Day.) The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has: “<em>Fourth Adventure: First Day</em>” (p. 476). The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “Dies I. Evening” (p. 201).</p>
<p>44.December 30, 1913. In <em>Black Book</em> 3, Jung noted: “All kinds of things lead me far away from my scientific endeavor, which I thought I had subscribed to firmly. I wanted to serve humanity through it, and now, my soul, you lead me to these new things. Yes, it is the in-between world, the pathless, the manifold-dazzling. I forgotthat I had reached a new world, which had been alien to me previously. I see neither way nor path. What I believed about the soul has to become true here, namely that she knows her own way better, and that no intention can prescribe her a better one. I feel that a large chunk of science has been broken off. I suppose it must be like this, for the sake of the soul and her life. I find the thought that this must occur only for me agonizing, and that perhaps no one will gain insight from my work. But my soul demands this achievement. I should be able to do this just for myself without hope—for the sake of God. This is truly a hard way. But what else did those anchorites of the first centuries of Christianity do? And were they the worst or least capable of those living at the end? Hardly, since they came to the most relentless conclusions with regard to the psychological necessity of their time. They left wife and child, wealth, glory and science—and turned toward the desert—for God’s sake. So be it” (pp. 1–2).</p>
<p>45.In the next chapter, the anchorite is identified as Ammonius. In a letter of December 31, 1913, Jung noted that the anchorite came from the third century (<em>JFA</em>). There are three historical figures named Ammonius in Alexandria from this period: Ammonius, a Christian philosopher in the third century, once thought to have been responsible for the medieval divisions of the gospels; Ammonius Cetus, who was born a Christian but turned to Greek philosophy and whose work presents a transition from Platonism to Neoplatonism; a Neoplatonic Ammonius in the fifth century, who tried to reconcile Aristotle and the Bible. At Alexandria, there was accommodation between Neoplatonism and Christianity, and some of the pupils of the latter Ammonius converted to Christianity.</p>
<p>46.Philo Judeaus, also called Philo of Alexandria (20 BCE–50 CE), was a Greek-speaking Jewish philosopher. His works presented a fusion of Greek philosophy and Judaism. For Philo, God, to whom he referred by the Platonic term “To On” (the One), was transcendent and unknowable. Certain powers reached down from God to the world. The facet of God knowable through reason is the divine Logos. There has been much debate on the precise relation between Philo’s concept of the Logos and John’s gospel. On June 23, 1954, Jung wrote to James Kirsch, “The gnosis from which John the Evangelist emanated, is definitely Jewish, but its essence is Hellenistic, in the style of Philo Judaeus, the founder of the teachings of the Logos” (<em>JA</em>).</p>
<p>47.In 1957, Jung wrote: “Until now it has not truly and fundamentally been noted that our time, despite the prevalence of irreligiosity, is so to speak congenitally charged with the attainment of the Christian epoch, namely with the <em>supremacy of the word</em>, that Logos which the central figure of Christian faith represents. The word has literally become our God and has remained so” (<em>Present and Future</em>, <em>CW</em> 10, §554).</p>
<p>48.John 1:1–10: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.”</p>
<p>49.John 1:14: “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.”</p>
<p>50.The <em>Draft</em> has: “Egyptian” (p. 227). In an Egyptian context, the water, dates, and bread would be offerings to the dead.</p>
<p>51.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Walking around in a circle I happen to return to myself and to him, the solitary one, who lives down in the depths hidden from the light, held securely by the warm bosom of the rock, above him the glowing desert and sharp resplendent skies” (p. 229).</p>
<p>52.Latin for “whole.”</p>
<p>53.The <em>Draft</em> has “to you,” and the <em>Corrected Draft</em> has “to me” (p. 232). Throughout this section, the <em>Corrected Draft</em> substitutes “to me” for “to you,” and “I” for “you” (p. 214).</p>
<p>54.In 1940, Jung commented on protective word magic (“Transformation symbolism in the mass,” <em>CW</em> 11, §442).</p>
<p>55.See note 48, above, p. 245.</p>
<p>56.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has “(The Anchorite). Second Day. Morning” (p. 219).</p>
<p>57.In “The Philosophical Tree” (1945), Jung noted: “A man who is rooted below as well as above is sort of like an upright and inverted tree. The goal is not the heights but the center” (<em>CW</em> 13, §333). He also commented on “The inverted tree” (§410f).</p>
<p>58.January 1, 1914.</p>
<p>59.In Greek mythology, Helios was the sun God, and he drove a chariot led by four horses across the sky.</p>
<p>60.During this period, Jung was engaged with the study of Gnostic texts, in which he found historical parallels to his own experiences. See Alfred Ribi, <em>The Search for the Roots: C. G. Jung and the Tradition of Gnosis</em>, Foreword by Lance Owens, tr. Don Reveau (Los Angeles: Gnosis Archive Books, 2013).</p>
<p>61.<em>In Synchronicity as a Principle of Acausal Connection</em> (1952), Jung wrote: “The scarab is a classical rebirth symbol. According to the description in the ancient Egyptian book <em>Am-Tuat</em>, the dead sun God transforms himself at the tenth station into Khepri, the scarab, and as such mounts the barge at the twelfth station, which raises the rejuvenated sun into the morning sky” (<em>CW</em> 8, §843).</p>
<p>62.Osiris was the Egyptian God of life, death, and fertility. Seth was the God of the desert. Osiris was murdered and dismembered by his brother Seth. Osiris’s body was recovered and put back together by his wife, Isis, and he was resurrected. Jung discussed Osiris and Seth in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912) (<em>CW</em> B, §358f).</p>
<p>63.Horus, Osiris’s son, was the Egyptian God of the sky. He fought against Seth.</p>
<p>64.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> continues: “and I am unreal to myself as in a dream” (p. 228). Christian anchorites were perpetually on guard against the appearance of Satan. A famous example of temptations by the devil occurs in Athanasius’s life of St. Anthony. In 1921 Jung noted that St. Anthony warned his monks “how cleverly the Devil disguised himself in order to bring holy men to their downfall. The Devil is naturally the voice of the anchorite’s own unconscious, that rises up against the forcible suppression of his nature” (<em>Psychological Types</em>, <em>CW</em> 6, §82). St. Anthony’s experiences were elaborated by Flaubert in his <em>Temptation of Anthony</em>, a work with which Jung was familiar (<em>Psychology and Alchemy</em>, <em>CW</em> 12, §59).</p>
<p>65.An inversion of Aristotle’s definition of man as the “rational animal.”</p>
<p>66.See Jung’s description of the Pleroma, p. 509f, below.</p>
<p>67.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> continue: “But I saw solitude and its beauty, and I seized the life of the inanimate and the meaning of the meaningless. I also understood this side of my manifoldness. And thus my tree grew in the solitude and quiet, eating the earth with roots reaching far down and drinking the sun with branches reaching high up. The solitary [alien] guest entered my soul. But my greening life flooded me. [Thus I wandered, following the nature of the water]. The solitude grew and extended around me. I did not know how unlimited the solitude was, and I wandered and looked. I wanted to fathom the depths of solitude and I went so far until every last sound of life died” (p. 235).</p>
<p>68.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has: <em>“Fifth Adventure: Death”</em> (p. 557).</p>
<p>69.January 2, 1914.</p>
<p>70.Cf. the vision in <em>Liber Primus</em>, ch. 5, “Descent into Hell in the Future,” p. 147.</p>
<p>71.In 1940 Jung wrote: “Evil is relative, partly avoidable, partly fate; the same goes for virtue and one often does not know which is worst” (“Attempt at a psychological interpretation of the dogma of the trinity,” <em>CW</em> 11, §291).</p>
<p>72.In the <em>Corrected Draft</em>, this sentence is replaced with: “Evil is one-half of the world, one of the two pans of the scale” (p. 242).</p>
<p>73.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “In this bloody battle death steps up to you, just like today where mass killing and dying fill the world. The coldness of death penetrates you. When I froze to death in my solitude, I saw clearly and saw what was to come, as clearly as I could see the stars and the distant mountains on a frosty night” (p. 260).</p>
<p>74.<em>In Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung had argued that the libido was not only a Schopenhauerian life urge, but contained the contrary striving toward death within itself (<em>CW</em> B, §696).</p>
<p>75.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “To live what is right and to let what is false die, that is the art of life” (p. 261). In 1934 Jung wrote: “Life is an energetic process like any other. But every energetic process is in principle irreversible and therefore unequivocally directed toward a goal, and the goal is the state of rest. . . From the middle of life, only he who is willing to die with life remains living. Since what takes place in the secret hour of life’s midday is the reversal of the parabola, the <em>birth of death</em>. . . Not wanting to live is identical with not wanting to die. Becoming and passing away is the same curve” (“Soul and death,” <em>CW</em> 8, §800). See my “ ‘The boundless expanse’: Jung’s reflections on life and death,” <em>Quadrant: Journal of the C. G. Jung Foundation for Analytical Psychology</em> 38 (2008), pp. 9–32.</p>
<p>76.See above, note 20, p. 124.</p>
<p>77.A reference to the vision above.</p>
<p>78.In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung commented on the motif of the wounded heel (<em>CW</em> B, §461).</p>
<p>79.“We are born between faeces and urine,” a saying widely attributed to St. Augustine, among others.</p>
<p>80.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has instead: “<em>Sixth Adventure</em>” (p. 586). The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “6. <em>Degenerate Ideals</em>” (p. 247).</p>
<p>81.The mosaic form resembles the mosaics at Ravenna, which Jung visited in 1913 and 1914, and which made a lasting impression on him.</p>
<p>82.January 5, 1914.</p>
<p>83.“Be gone, Satan” —a common expression in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>84.The Hyperboreans were a race in Greek mythology who lived in a land of sunshine beyond the north wind, worshiping Apollo. Nietzsche referred on several occasions to the free spirits as Hyperboreans, <em>The Antichrist</em>, §1 (<em>Twilight of the Idols/The Antichrist</em>, tr. R. Hollingdale [London: Penguin, 1990], p. 127).</p>
<p>85.A reference to Genesis 2:18: “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.” There is one reference to a Philetus in the Bible, 2 Timothy 2:16–18: “But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.”</p>
<p>86.In Chronicles 1:15, David dances before the ark of the covenant.</p>
<p>87.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has “the wisdom” instead of “the deepest knowledge” (p. 251).</p>
<p>88.The <em>Draft</em> and <em>Corrected Draft</em> have: “I had become a victim of my sanctuaries and beauties, and so I died miserable and depressed [therefore death came to me]” (p. 254).</p>
<p>89.In Persia, the crushed petals of rose were steam-distilled to make rose oil, from which perfumes were made.</p>
<p>90.In 1926, Jung wrote: “The transition from morning to afternoon is a <em>transvaluation of earlier values</em>. From this comes the necessity to appreciate the value of the opposite of our former ideals, to recognize the error in former truth and to feel how much antagonism and even hatred lay in what had formerly passed for love for us” (<em>The Unconscious in Normal and Sick Psychic Life, CW</em> 7, §115).</p>
<p>91.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “green creature” (p. 255).</p>
<p>92.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “my” (p. 257).</p>
<p>93.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has: “me” (p. 257).</p>
<p>94.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> continues: “like a chameleon” (p. 258). A passage occurs here in the <em>Draft</em>, a paraphrase of which follows: It is our chameleon nature that forces us through these transformations. So long as we are chameleons, we need an annual journey in the bath of rebirth. Therefore I looked at the outdating of my ideals with horror, since I loved my natural greenness and mistrusted my chameleon skin, which changed colors according to the environment. The chameleon does this cleverly. One calls this change a progress through rebirth. So you experience 777 rebirths. The Buddha did not need quite so long to see that even rebirths are vain (pp. 275–76). There was a belief that the soul had to go through 777 reincarnations (Ernest Woods, <em>The New Theosophy</em> [Wheaton, IL: The Theosophical Press, 1929], p. 41).</p>
<p>95.The <em>Draft</em> has instead: “the vestige of my ideal” (p. 277).</p>
<p>96.Image legend: “This image was printed on Christmas 1915.” The depiction of Izdubar strongly resembles an illustration of him in Wilhelm Roscher’s <em>Ausführliches Lexikon der Griechischen und Römischen Mythologie</em>, of which Jung possessed a copy ([Leipzig: Teubner, 1884–1937], vol. 2, p. 775). Izdubar was an early name given the figure now known as Gilgamesh. This was based on a mistranscription. In 1906 Peter Jensen noted: “It has now been established that Gilgamesch is the chief protagonist of the epic, and not Gistchubar or Izdubar as assumed previously” (<em>Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur</em> [Strassburg: Karl Trübner, 1906], p. 2). Jung had discussed the Gilgamesh epic in 1912 in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>, using the corrected form, and cited Jensen’s work several times.</p>
<p>97.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has instead: “<em>Seventh Adventure. First Day</em>” (p. 626). The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “7. The Great Encounter. First Day. The Hero from the East” (p. 262).</p>
<p>98.January 8, 1914.</p>
<p>99.In Egyptian mythology, the Western lands (the Western bank of the Nile) were the land of the dead.</p>
<p>100.In <em>The Gay Science</em>, Nietzsche argued that thinking originated through the cultivation and uniting of several impulses which had the effect of poisons: the impulse to doubt, to negate, to wait, to collect, and to dissolve (“On the doctrine of poisons,” tr. Walter Kaufmann [New York: Vintage, 1974] book 3, section 113).</p>
<p>101.In Babylonian mythology, Tiamat, the mother of the Gods, waged war with an army of demons.</p>
<p>102.The issue of the relation of science to belief was critical in Jung’s psychology of religion. See “Psychology and religion” (1938), <em>CW</em> 11.</p>
<p>103.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “This is what I saw in the dream” (p. 295).</p>
<p>104.See <em>Liber Secundus</em>, ch. 4, p. 268f.</p>
<p>105.In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), Jung considered thinking and feeling to be the rational functions (<em>CW</em> 6, §731).</p>
<p>106.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “As David, you may slay him, Goliath, with a cunning and impudent slingshot” (p. 299). In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (<em>CW</em> B, §383f), Jung discussed the Babylonian creation myth in which Marduk, the God of spring, battles with Tiamat and her army. Marduk slayed Tiamat, and from this he created the world. Thus “the mighty huntsman” corresponds to Marduk.</p>
<p>107.St. Sebastian was a Christian martyr persecuted by the Romans who lived in the third century. He was often depicted tied to a tree and shot with arrows. The earliest such representation is in the Basilica Sant’Apollinaire Nuova in Ravenna.</p>
<p>108.This refers to Hebrews 10:31: “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”</p>
<p>109.This refers to Jacob’s wrestling with the angel in Genesis 32:24–29: “And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.”</p>
<p>110.Image legend: “Arthava-veda 4,1,4.” <em>Arthava-veda</em> 4,1,4 is a charm to promote virility: “Thee, the plant, which the Gandharva dug up for Varuna, when his virility had decayed, thee, that causest strength, we dig up. / Ushas (Aurora), Sûrya (the sun), and this charm of mine; the bull Pragâpati (the lord of creatures) shall with his lusty fire arouse him! / This herb shall make thee so very full of lusty strength, that thou shalt, when thou art excited, exhale heat as a thing on fire! / The fire of the plants, and the essence of the bulls shall arouse him! Do thou, O Indra, controller of bodies, place the lusty force of men into this person! / Thou (O herb) art the first-born sap of the waters and also of the plants. Moreover thou art the brother of Soma, and the lusty force of the antelope buck! / Now, O Agni, now, O Savitar, now, O goddess Sarasvatî, now, O Brahmanaspati, do thou stiffen the pasas as a bow! / I stiffen thy pasas as a bowstring upon the bow. Embrace thou (women) as the antelope buck the gazelle with ever unfailing (strength)! / The strength of the horse, the mule, the goat and the ram, moreover the strength of the bull bestow upon him, O controller of bodies (Indra)!” (<em>Sacred Books of the East</em> 42, pp. 31–32) The connection is to the healing of Izdubar, the wounded bull God.</p>
<p>111.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has instead: “I have slept little; unclear dreams upset me more than they have prompted the redeeming word” (p. 686).</p>
<p>112.January 9, 1914.</p>
<p>113.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “thus spoke another voice in me, like an echo” (p. 309).</p>
<p>114.This refers to a scene in the text describing how Jung reduced Izdubar to the size of an egg so he could secretly carry Izdubar into the house and enable his healing. Jung said to Aniela Jaffé concerning these sections that some of the fantasies were driven by fear, such as the chapter on the devil and the chapter on Gilgamesh-Izdubar. From one perspective it was stupid that he had to find a way to help the giant, but he felt that if he didn’t do so, he would have failed. He paid for the ridiculous solution through realizing that he had captured a God. Many of these fantasies were a hellish combination of the sublime and the ridiculous (<em>MP</em>, p. 147–48).</p>
<p>115.In the <em>Draft</em>, this sentence reads: “Like many other Gods and on numerous previous occasions, the God was declared to be a fantasy, and it was thus assumed that he had been dealt with” (p. 314).</p>
<p>116.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “We men apparently believed that there is no such thing as a fantasy, and if we declared something to be fantastic, then it would be well and truly destroyed” (p. 314). In 1932, Jung commented on the contemporary dispargement of fantasy (“The development of the personality,” <em>CW</em> 17, §302).</p>
<p>117.This seems to refer to the following chapter.</p>
<p>118.St. Christopher (Greek for “Christ bearer” ) was a martyr in the third century. According to legend, he had sought a hermit to inquire as to how he could serve Jesus. The hermit suggested he help carry people across a dangerous crossing in a river, which he did. On one occasion, a small child asked to be taken across. He found that the child was heavier than anyone else, and the child revealed himself to be Christ, bearing the sins of the world.</p>
<p>119.Matthew 11:30.</p>
<p>120.I.e., as Izdubar came to Jung.</p>
<p>121.The chapter title is missing in the calligraphic volume, and is given here following the <em>Draft</em>.</p>
<p>122.Images 50–64 symbolically depict the regeneration of Izdubar.</p>
<p>123.Luke 2:8–11: “And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.”</p>
<p>124.Matthew 2:1–2: “Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.”</p>
<p>125.The attributes of the God in this section are elaborated as the attributes of Abraxas in the second and third sermons in <em>Scrutinies</em>. See below, p. 517f.</p>
<p>126.In “Dreams,” Jung noted on January 3, 1917: “In Lib. nov. snake image III incent” [stimulus to snake image III in <em>Liber Novus</em>] (p. 1). This notation appears to refer to this image.</p>
<p>127.Image legend: “brahman,aspati.” Julius Eggling notes that “Brihaspati or Brahmanaspati, the lord of prayer or worship, takes the place of Agni, as the representative of the priestly dignity. . . In Rig-Veda X, 68,9. . . Brihaspati is said to have found (avindat) the dawn, the sky and the fire (agni), and to have chased away the darkness with his light (arka, sun), he seems rather to represent the element of light and fire generally” (<em>Sacred Books of the East</em> 12, p. xvi). See above note to image 45, note 110, p. 291.</p>
<p>128.The solar barge is a common motif in ancient Egypt. The barge was seen as the typical means of movement of the sun. In Egyptian mythology, the Sun God struggled against the monster Aphophis, who attempted to swallow the solar barge as it traveled across the heavens each day. In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912) Jung discussed the Egyptian “living sun-disc” (<em>CW</em> B, §153) and the motif of the sea monster (§ 549f). In his 1952 revision of this text, he noted that the battle with the sea monster represented the attempt to free ego-consciousness from the grip of the unconscious (<em>Symbols of Transformation</em>, <em>CW</em> 5, §539). The solar barge resembles some of the illustrations in the <em>Egyptian Book of the Dead</em> (ed. E. A. Wallis Budge [London: Arkana, 1899 / 1985]), i.e., the vignettes on pp. 390, 400, and 404). The oarsman is usually a falcon-headed Horus. The night journey of the Sun God through the underworld is depicted in the <em>Amduat</em>, which has been seen as symbolic process of transformation. See Theodor Abt and Erik Hornung, <em>Knowledge for the Afterlife</em>. <em>The Egyptian Amduat—A Quest for Immortality</em> (Zürich: Living Human Heritage Publications, 2003).</p>
<p>129.In “Dreams,” Jung wrote: “17 I 1917. Tonight: awful and formidable avalanches come crashing down the mountainside, like utterly nightmarish clouds; they will fill the valley on whose rim I am standing on the opposite side. I know that I must take flight up the mountain to avoid the dreadful catastrophe. This dream is explained in the Black Book in strange terms, in an entry bearing the same date. On 17 I 1917 I produced a drawing with red spots on page 58 of Lib. Nov. On 18 I 1917 I read about the current formation of huge sunspots” (p. 2). The following is a paraphrase of the entry in <em>Black Book</em> 6 for January 17, 1917: Jung asks what it is that fills him with fear and horror, what is falling down from the high mountain. His soul tells him to help the Gods and to sacrifice to them. She tells him that the worm crawls up to Heaven, it begins to cover the stars and with a tongue of fire he eats the dome of the seven blue heavens. She tells him that he will also be eaten, and that he should crawl into the stone and wait in the narrow casing until the torrent of fire is over. Snow falls from the mountains because the fiery breath falls down from above the clouds. The God is coming, Jung should get ready to receive him. Jung should hide himself in stone, as the God is a terrible fire. He should remain quiet and look within, so that the God does not consume him in flames (p. 152f).</p>
<p>130.Image legend: “hiran,yagarbha.” In the <em>Rig Veda</em>, hiran,yagarbha was the primal seed from which Brahma was born. In Jung’s copy of vol. 32 of the <em>Sacred Books of the East</em> (Vedic Hymns) the only section that is cut is the opening one, a hymn “To the Unknown God.” This begins “In the beginning there arose the Golden Child (Hira<em>n</em>yagarbha); as soon as born, he alone was the lord of all that is. He established the earth and this heaven:—Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?” (p. 1). In Jung’s copy of the Upanishads in the <em>Sacred Books of the East</em>, there is a piece of paper inserted near page 311 of the Maitrâyana-Brâhmana-Upanishad, a passage describing the Self, which begins, “And the same Self is also called. . . Hira<em>n</em>yagarbha” (vol. 15, pt. 2).</p>
<p>131.The face of the monster is similar to HI 29.</p>
<p>132.In “Dreams,” Jung noted on February 4, 1917: “Started work on the Opening of the Egg (Image)” (p. 5). This indicates that the image depicts the regeneration of Izdubar from the egg. Concerning the solar barge in this image, cf. image 55 in the facsimile edition and above, note 128, p. 301.</p>
<p>133.Image legend: “çatapatha-brâhmanam 2,2,4.” Satapatha-brâhmana 2,2,4 (<em>Sacred Books of the East</em>, vol. 12) provides the cosmological justification behind the Agnihotra. It commences by describing how Prajapati, desiring to be reproduced, produced Agni from his mouth. Prajapati offered himself to Agni, and saved himself from Death as he was about to be devoured. The Agnihotra (lit. fire healing) is a Vedic ritual performed at sunrise and sunset. The performers purify themselves, light a sacred fire, and chant verses and a prayer to Agni.</p>
<p>134.The <em>Draft</em> has instead: “Third Day” (p. 329).</p>
<p>135.January 10, 1914. In <em>Black Book</em> 3, Jung wrote: “It appears as if something has been achieved through this memorable event. But it is incalculable where this will all lead. I hardly dare say that Izdubar’s fate is grotesque and tragic, for that is what our most precious life is. Fr. Th. Vischer’s (A[uch]. E[iner]) is the first attempt to elevate this truth to a system. He rightly deserves a place among the immortal. What lies in the middle is the truth. It has many faces; one is certainly comical, another sad, a third evil, a fourth tragic, a fifth funny, a sixth is a grimace, and so forth. Should one of these faces become particularly obtrusive, we thus recognize that we have deviated from certain truth and approach an extreme that constitutes a definite impasse should we decide to pursue this route. It is a murderous task to write the wisdom of real life, particularly if one has committed many years to serious scientific research. What proves to be most difficult is to grasp the playfulness of life (the childish, so to speak). All the manifold sides of life, the great, the beautiful, the serious, the black, the devilish, the good, the ridiculous, the grotesque are fields of application which each tend to wholly absorb the beholder or describer. / Our time requires something capable of regulating the mind. Just as the concrete world has expanded from the limitedness of the ancient outlook to the immeasurable diversity of our modern outlook, the world of intellectual possibilities has developed to unfathomable diversity. Infinitely long paths, paved with thousands of thick volumes, lead from one specialization to another. Soon no one will be able to walk down these paths anymore. And then only specialists will remain. More than ever we require the living truth of the life of the mind, of something capable of providing firm guidance” (pp. 74–77). Vischer’s work was <em>Auch Einer: Eine Reisebekanntschaft</em> (Stuttgart, 1884). In 1921, Jung wrote: “Vischer’s novel, <em>Auch Einer</em>, gives a deep insight into this side of the introverted state of the soul, and also into the underlying symbolism of the collective unconscious” (<em>Psychological Types</em>, <em>CW</em> 6, §627). In 1932 Jung commented on Vischer in <em>The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga</em>, p. 54. On <em>Auch Einer</em>, see Ruth Heller, “Auch Einer: the epitome of F. Th. Vischer’s Philosophy of Life,” <em>German Life and Letters</em> 8 (1954) pp. 9–18.</p>
<p>136.Roscher notes that “As a God, Izdubar is associated with the Sun-God” (<em>Ausführliches Lexikon der Griechischen und Römischen Mythologie</em>, vol. 2, p. 774). The incubation and rebirth of Izdubar follows the classic pattern of solar myths. In <em>Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes</em>, Leo Frobenius pointed out the widespread motif of a woman becoming pregnant through a process of immaculate conception and giving birth to the Sun God, who develops in a remarkably short period of time. In some forms, he incubates in an egg. Frobenius related this to the setting and rising of the sun in the sea ([Berlin, G. Reimer, 1904], pp. 223–63). Jung cited this work on a number of occasions in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912).</p>
<p>137.In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), Jung commented on the motif of the renewed God: “The renewed God signifies a renewed attitude, that is, a renewed possibility for intensive life, a recovery of life, because psychologically God always denotes the greatest value, thus the greatest sum of the libido, the greatest intensity of life, the optimum of psychological life’s activity” (<em>CW</em> 6, §301).</p>
<p>138.In the next chapter, Jung finds himself in Hell.</p>
<p>139.In “Dreams,” Jung wrote on February 15, 1917: “Finished copying the opening scene. / The most wonderful feeling of renewal. Back to scientific work today. / Types!” (p. 5). This refers to completing this section of the transcription into the calligraphic volume, and to continuing his work on psychological types.</p>
<p>140.The blue and yellow circles are similar to image 60 in the facsimile edition.</p>
<p>141.This might be the image Tina Keller is referring to in the following statement in an interview, where she recalled Jung’s discussion of his relations with Emma Jung and Toni Wolff: “Jung once showed me a picture in the book he was painting, and he said, ‘See these three snakes that are intertwined. This is how we three struggle with this problem.’ I can only say that it seemed to me very important that, even as a passing phenomenon, here three people were accepting a destiny which was not gone into just for their personal satisfaction” (interview with Gene Nameche, 1969, R. D. Laing papers, University of Glasgow, p. 27).</p>
<p>142.January 12, 1914.</p>
<p>143.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “<em>çataphatha-brâhmanam</em> 2,2,4.” The same inscription is given to image 64. See notes 132 and 133, above.</p>
<p>144.In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche wrote: “one must have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star” (“Zarathustra’s prologue,” §5, p. 46; as underlined in Jung’s copy).</p>
<p>145.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “<em>Khândogya</em>-upanishad 1,2,1–7.” The <em>Chandogya Upanisad</em> reads: “Once, when the gods and demons, both children of Prajapati, arrayed themselves against each other, the gods got hold of the High Chant. ‘With this we will overpower them,’ they thought. / So they venerated the High Chant as the breath within the nostrils. The demons riddled it with evil. As a result, one smells with it both good and evil odors, for it is riddled with evil. / Then they venerated the High Chant as speech. The demons riddled it with evil. As a result, one speaks with it both what is true and what is false, for it is riddled with evil. / Then they venerated the High Chant as sight. The demons riddled it with evil. As a result one sees with it both what is good to see and what is not, for it is riddled with evil. / Then they venerated the High Chant as hearing. The demons riddled it with evil. As a result, one hears with it both what is good to hear and what is not, for it is riddled with evil. / Then they venerated the High Chant as the mind. The demons riddled it with evil. As a result, one envisages with it both what is good to envisage and what is not, for it is riddled with evil. / Finally, they venerated the High Chant as just this breath here within the mouth. And when the demons hurled themselves at it, they were smashed to bits like a clod of earth hurled against a target that is a rock” (<em>Upanishads</em>, tr. P. Olivelle [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996]). The “High Chant” is OM.</p>
<p>146.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has instead: “<em>Eighth Adventure</em>” (p. 793).</p>
<p>147.In <em>Memories</em>, while commenting on the Liverpool dream (see below, p. 418, n. 296), Jung noted “According to an older view, the liver is the seat of life” (p. 224).</p>
<p>148.In 1940, Jung discussed ritual anthropophagy, sacrifice, and self-sacrifice in “Transformation symbolism in the mass,” <em>CW</em> 11.</p>
<p>149.In <em>Black Book</em> 3, Jung noted: “The curtain drops. What dreadful game has been played here? I realize: <em>Nil humanum a me alienum esse puto</em> [nothing human is alien to me]” (p. 91). The phrase is from the Roman playwright Terence, from <em>Heauton Timorumenos</em>. On September 2, 1960, Jung wrote to Herbert Read, “As a medical psychologist I do not merely assume, but I am thoroughly convinced, that <em>nil humanum a me alienum esse is even my duty</em>” (<em>Letters</em> 2, p. 589).</p>
<p>150.Instead of this sentence, the <em>Draft</em> has: “This experience accomplished what I needed. It occurred in the most abominable manner. The evil that I wanted performed the infamous deed, seemingly without me and yet with me, since I learned that I am party to all the horror of human nature. I destroyed the divine child, the image of my God’s formation, through the most dreadful crime which human nature is capable of. It takes this atrocity to destroy the image of the God that drinks all my life force so that I could reclaim my life” (p. 355).</p>
<p>151.I.e., the ritual of the mass.</p>
<p>152.Jung developed his ideas concerning the significance of symbols in <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921). See <em>CW</em> 6, §814ff.</p>
<p>153.In 1909, Jung had his house built in Küsnacht, and had the following motto from the Delphic oracle carved above the door: “Vocatus atque non vocatus deus aderit” (Called or not, the God will be present). The source of the quotation was Erasmus’s <em>Collectanea adagiorum</em>. Jung explained the motto as follows: “It says, yes, the god will be on the spot, but in what form and to what purpose? I have put the inscription there to remind my patients and myself: <em>Timor dei initium sapientiae</em> [Psalms 111:10]. Here another not less important road begins, not the approach to ‘Christianity’ but to God himself and this seems to be the ultimate question” (Jung to Eugene Rolfe, November 19, 1960, <em>Letters</em> 2, p. 611).</p>
<p>154.There is a note at bottom of the page: “21 VIII. 1917. fect. 14.X.17,” possibly an abbreviation for “fecit,” i.e., “made.”</p>
<p>155.In <em>Black Book</em> 7, in Jung’s fantasy of October 7, 1917, a figure appears, Ha, who says he is the father of Philemon. Jung’s soul describes him as a black magician. His secret is the runes, which Jung’s soul wants to learn. He refuses to teach them, but shows some examples, which Jung’s soul asks him to explain. Some of the runes later appear in these paintings. About the runes in this painting, Ha explained: “See the two with different feet, one earth foot and one sun foot—which reach toward the upper cone and have the sun inside, but I have made one crooked line toward the other sun. Therefore one must reach downward. Meanwhile the upper sun comes out of the cone and the cone gazes after it, dejected about where it is going. One has to retrieve it with a hook and would like to place it in the small prison. Then the three have to stand together, unite, and twirl up at the top (curled). With this they manage to free the sun from its prison again. Now you make a thick bottom and a roof, where the sun sits safe at the top. But inside the house the other sun has risen also. Therefore you too are coiled up at the top and have made a roof over the prison again at the bottom, so that the upper sun cannot enter. The two suns always want to be together—I said so, didn’t I—the two cones—each has a sun. You want to let them come together, because then you think that thus you could be one. You have now drawn up both suns and brought them to one another, and now slope to the other side—that is important (=) but then there are simply two suns at the bottom, so therefore you have to go to the lower cone. Then you put the suns together there, but in the middle, neither at the bottom nor at the top, therefore there are not four but two, but the upper cone is at the bottom and there is a thick roof above and if you want to continue, you long to return with both arms. But at the bottom you have a prison for two, for both of you. Therefore you make a prison for the lower sun and fall toward the other side, to get the lower sun out of the prison. This is what you long for, and the upper cone comes and makes a bridge toward the lower, taking back its sun, which has run away before, and now the morning clouds come into the lower cone, but its sun is beyond the line, invisible (horizon). Now you are one and happy that you have the sun at the top and long to be up there, too. But you are imprisoned in the prison of the lower sun, that is rising. There is a stop. Now you make something quadrilateral above, which you call thoughts, a prison without doors, with thick walls, so that the upper sun does not leave, but the cone has already gone. You lean toward the other side, long for the below and coil up at the bottom. Then you are one and make the serpent’s way between the suns—that is amusing! ˜ and important (=). But because it was amusing below, there is a roof above and you must raise upward the hook with both arms, so that it goes through the roof. Then the sun below is free and there is a prison above. You look downward, but the upper sun looks toward you. But you stand upright as a pair and have detached the serpent from you—you have probably been put off. Therefore you make a prison for the below. Now the serpent crosses the sky above the earth. You are driven completely apart, the serpent wriggles its way through the sky around all the stars far above the earth. / At the bottom it says: the mother gives me this wisdom. / Be you content” (pp. 9–10). To Aniela Jaffé, Jung recounted that he had had a vision of a red clay tablet inscribed with hieroglyphics and embedded in his bedroom wall, and that he had transcribed the tablet the following day. He felt that it contained an important message, but he didn’t understand it (<em>MP</em>, p. 172). In letters to Sabina Spielrein dated September 13 and October 10, 1917, Jung commented on the significance of some hieroglyphs she’d seen in a dream. On October 10, he wrote to her that “with your hieroglyphics we are dealing with phylogenetic engrams of a historical symbolic nature.” Commenting on the contempt meted out to <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> by the Freudians, he described himself as “clinging to his runes” which he would not hand over to those who would not understand them (“The letters of Jung to Sabina Spielrein,” <em>Journal of Analytical Psychology</em> 41 [2001], pp. 187–88).</p>
<p>156.The runes in this painting appear in <em>Black Book</em> 7 in the entry for October 7, 1917. Jung appended the date “10 September 1917” to them. Ha explained: “If you have managed to move the arc forward, you make a bridge below and move upward and downward from the center, or you separate above and below, split the sun again and crawl like the serpent over the upper and receive the lower. You take with you what you have experienced and go forward to something new” (p. 11).</p>
<p>157.The runes in this painting appear in <em>Black Book</em> 7 in the entry for October 7, 1917. Jung appended the date “11 September 1917” to them. Ha explained: “Now, however, you make a bridge between you and the one longs for the below. But the serpent crawls at the top and draws the sun up. Then both of you move upward and want to go to the upper (<img src="images/00000.jpeg" alt="image" loading="lazy">), but the sun is below and tries to draw you down. But you draw a line above the below and long for the above and are completely at one. There the serpent comes and wants to drink from the vessel of the below. But there comes the upper cone and stops. Like the serpent, the looking coils back and moves forward again and afterward you very much (—) long to return. But the lower sun pulls and thus you become balanced again. But soon you fall backward, since the one has reached out toward the upper sun. The other does not want this and so you fall asunder, and therefore you must bind yourselves together three times. Then you stand upright again and you hold both suns before you, as if they were your eyes, the light of the above and the below before you and you stretch your arms out toward it, and you come together to become one and must separate the two suns and you long to return a little to the lower and reach out toward the upper. But the lower cone has swallowed the upper cone into itself, because the suns were so close. Therefore you place the upper cone back up again, and because the lower is then no longer there, you want to draw it up again and have a profound longing for the lower cone, while it is empty Above, since the sun Above the line is invisible. Because you have longed to return downward for so long, the upper cone comes down and tries to capture the invisible lower sun within itself. There the serpent’s way goes at the very top, you are split and everything below is beneath the ground. You long to be further above, but the lower longing already comes crawling like a serpent, and you build a prison over her. But there the lower comes up, you long to be at the very bottom and the two suns suddenly reappear, close together. You long for this and come to be imprisoned. Then the one is defiant and the other longs for the below. The prison opens, the one longs even more to be below, but the defiant one longs for the above and is no longer defiant, but longs for what is to come. And thus it comes to pass: the sun rises at the bottom, but it is imprisoned and above three nest boxes are made for you two and the upper sun, which you expect, because you have imprisoned the lower one. But now the upper cone comes down powerfully and divides you and swallows the lower cone. This is impossible. Therefore you place the cones tip to tip and curl up toward the front in the center. Because that’s no way to leave matters! So it has to happen otherwise. The one attempts to reach upward, the other downward; you must strive to do this, since if the tips of the cones meet, they can hardly be separated anymore—therefore I have placed the hard seed in-between. Tip to tip—that would be too beautifully regular. This pleases father and mother, but where does that leave me? And my seed? Therefore a quick change of plan! One makes a bridge between you both, imprisons the lower sun again, the one longs for the above and the below, but the other longs especially strongly for the forward, above and below. Thus the future can become—see, how well I can already say it—yes, indeed, I am clever—cleverer than you—since you have taken matters in hand so well, you also get everything beneath the roof and into the house, the serpent, and the two suns. That is always most amusing. But you are separated and because you have drawn the line above, the serpent and the suns are too far below. This happens because beforehand you curled around yourself from below. But you come together and into agreement and stand upright, because it is good and amusing and fine and you say: thus shall it remain. But down comes the upper cone, because it felt dissatisfied, that you had set a limit above beforehand. The upper cone reaches out immediately for its sun—but there is nowhere a sun to be found anymore and the serpent also jumps up, to catch the suns. You fall over, and one of you is eaten by the lower cone. With the help of the upper cone you get him out and in return you give the lower cone its sun and the upper cone its as well. You spread yourself out like the one-eyed, who wanders in heaven and hold the cones beneath you—but in the end matters still go awry. You leave the cones and the suns to go and stand side by side and still do not want the same. In the end you agree to bind yourself threefold to the upper cone descending from above. / I am called Ha-Ha-Ha—a jolly name—I am clever—look here, my last sign, that is the magic of the white man who lived in the great magic house, the magic which you call Christianity. Your medicine man said so himself: I and the father are one, no one comes to the father other than through me. I told you so, the upper cone is the father. He has bound himself threefold to you and stands between the other and the father. Therefore the other must go through him, if he wants to reach the cone” (pp. 13–14).</p>

<p>160.<em>The Imitation of Christ</em> is a work of devotional instruction that appeared at the beginning of the fifteenth century and became extremely popular. Its authorship is still in dispute, though it is generally attributed to Thomas à Kempis (ca. 1380–1471), who was a member of the Brethren of the Common Life, a religious community in the Netherlands that was a prime representative of the <em>devotio moderna</em>, a movement stressing mediation and the inner life. In clear and simple language, <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> exhorts people to be concerned with the inner spiritual life as opposed to outer things, gives advice as to how this is to be lived, and shows the comfort and ultimate rewards of a life lived in Christ. The title derives from the first line of the first chapter, where it is also stated that “Anyone who wishes to understand and to savor the words of Christ to the full must try to make his whole life conform to the pattern of Christ’s life” (<em>The Imitation of Christ</em>, tr. B. Knott [London: Fount, 1996], book 1, ch. 1, p. 33). The theme of the Imitation of Christ dates back much earlier. There was much discussion in the Middle Ages concerning how this was to be understood (on the history of this notion, see Giles Constable, “The Ideal of the Imitation of Christ,” in <em>Three Studies in Medieval Religious and Social Thought</em> [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995], pp. 143–248). As Constable shows, two broad approaches may be distinguished, depending upon how imitation was understood: the first, the imitation of the divinity of Christ, stressed the doctrine of deification by which “Christ showed the way to become God through him” (p. 218). The second, the imitation of the humanity and body of Christ, stressed the imitation of his life on earth. The most extreme form of this was in the tradition of stigmatics, individuals who bore the wounds of Christ on their body.</p>
<p>161.I.e., <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>.</p>
<p>162.In <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>, Thomas à Kempis wrote: “There is no salvation for the soul nor hope for eternal life except in the cross. Take up your cross then, and follow Jesus, and you will enter eternal life. He went before you carrying his cross, and on the cross he died for you, so that you too should carry your cross, and long for a death on the cross. For if you share his death, you will also share his life” (book 2, ch. 12, p. 90).</p>
<p>163.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “But we know that the ancients spoke to us in images. Hence my thinking advised me to emulate Christ, not to imitate him but because he is the way. If I follow a way, I do not imitate him. But if I imitate Christ, he is my goal and not my way. But if he is my way, I thus go toward his goal, as the mysteries had shown me previously. Thus my thinking spoke to me in a confused and ambiguous manner, but it advised me to imitate Christ” (p. 366).</p>
<p>164.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “His own way led him to the cross for humanity’s own way leads to the cross. My way also leads to the cross, but not to that of Christ, but to mine, which is the image of the sacrifice and of life. But as I was still blinded, I was inclined to yield to the enormous temptation of imitation and to look across to Christ, as if he were my goal and not my way” (p. 367).</p>
<p>165.The references seem to be to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, respectively.</p>
<p>166.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Consider this. Once you have considered it, you will understand the adventure that beset me the following night” (p. 368).</p>
<p>167.Second night.</p>

<p>169.“The resolve of the upright depends upon the grace of God, not on their own wisdom; in him they trust, whatever they undertake; for man proposes, God disposes, and <em>it is not for man to choose his lot</em>” (<em>The Imitation of Christ</em>, book 1, ch. 19, p. 54).</p>
<p>170.Instead of this sentence, <em>Black Book</em> 4 has: “Well, Henri Bergson, I think there you have it—this is precisely the genuine and right intuitive method” (p. 9). On March 20, 1914, Adolf Keller gave a talk on “Bergson and the theory of libido” to the Zürich Psychoanalytical Society. In the discussion, Jung said “Bergson should have been discussed here long ago. B. says everything that we have not said” (<em>MZS</em>, vol. 1, p. 57). On July 24, 1914, Jung gave a talk in London where he noted that his “constructive method” corresponded to Bergson’s “intuitive method” (“On psychological understanding,” <em>Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology</em>, ed. Constance Long [London: Ballière, Tindall and Cox, 1917], p. 399). The work Jung read was <em>L’evolution creatrice</em> (Paris: Alcan, 1907). He possessed the 1912 German translation.</p>
<p>171.Cary Baynes’s transcription has: “Bergson’s.”</p>
<p>172.In the <em>Draft</em>, the speaker is identified as “The Uncanny One.”</p>
<p>173.The biblical Ezechiel was a prophet in the sixth century BCE. Jung saw a great deal of historical significance in his visions, which incorporated a mandala with quaternities, as representing the humanization and differentiation of Yahweh. Although Ezechiel’s visions are often viewed as pathological, Jung defended their normality, arguing that visions are natural phenomena that can be designated as pathological only when their morbid aspects have been demonstrated (“Answer to Job,” 1952, <em>CW</em> 11, §§665, 667, 686). Anabaptism was a radical movement of the sixteenth-century Protestant reformation, which tried to restore the spirit of the early church. The movement originated in Zürich in the 1520s, where they rebelled against Zwingli and Luther’s reluctance to completely reform the church. They rejected the practice of infant baptism, and promoted adult baptisms (the first of these took place in Zollikon, which is near Küsnacht, where Jung lived). Anabaptists stressed the immediacy of the human relation with God and were critical of religious institutions. The movement was violently suppressed and thousands were killed. See Daniel Liechty, ed., <em>Early Anabaptist Spirituality: Selected Writings</em> (New York: Paulist Press, 1994).</p>
<p>174.In 1918, Jung argued that Christianity had suppressed the animal element (“On the unconscious,” <em>CW</em> 10, §31). He elaborated this theme in his 1923 seminars in Polzeath, Cornwall. In 1939, he argued that the “psychological sin” which Christ committed was that “he did not live the animal side of himself” (<em>Modern Psychology</em> 4, p. 230).</p>
<p>175.Chapter 13 of book 1 of <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> begins: “As long as we are in this world we shall have to face trials and temptations. As it says in the Book of Job—What is man’s life on earth but a time of temptation? That is why we should treat our temptations as a serious matter and endeavor by vigilance and prayer to keep the devil from finding any loophole. Remember that the devil never sleeps, but goes about looking for his prey. There is no one so perfect and holy that he never meets temptation; we cannot escape it altogether” (p. 46). He goes on to emphasize the benefits of temptation, as being the means through which a man is “humbled, purified and disciplined.”</p>
<p>176.The citation is from Cicero’s <em>Cato Maior de Senectute</em> (Cato the Elder on Old Age). The text is a eulogy to old age. The lines Jung cites are italicized in the following passage: “Omnino, ut mihi quidem videtur, <em>rerum omnium satietas vitae facit satietatem.</em> Sunt pueritiae studia certa; num igitur ea desiderant adulescentes? Sunt ineuntis adulescentiae: num ea constans iam requirit aetas quae media dicitur? Sunt etiam eius aetatis; ne ea quidem quaeruntur in senectute. Sunt extrema quaedam studia senectutis: ergo, ut superiorum aetatum studia occidunt, sic occidunt etiam senectutis; quod cum evenit, <em>satietas vitae tempus maturum mortis affert</em>” (Tullii Ciceronis, <em>Cato Maior de Senectute</em>, ed. Julius Sommerbrodt [Berlin: Weidmannsche Buchhandlung, 1873]). Translation: “Undoubtedly, as it seems to me at least, <em>satiety of all things causes satiety of life.</em> Boyhood has certain pursuits: does adolescence yearn for them? Adolescence has its pursuits: does the matured or so-called middle stage of life need them? Maturity, too, has such as not even sought in old age, and finally, there are those suitable to old age. Therefore as the pleasures and pursuits of the earlier periods of life fall away, so also do those of old age; and when that happens <em>one is satiated of life and the time is ripe for death</em>” (Cicero, <em>De Senectute, De Amicitia, De Divinatione</em> [London: William Heinemann, 1927], pp. 86–88, tr. mod.).</p>
<p>177.<em>Black Book</em> 4 has: “paranoid form of Dementia praecox” (p. 16).</p>
<p>178.In the <em>Draft</em> a passage occurs here, a paraphrase of which follows: Since I was a thinker, my feeling was the lowest, oldest, and least developed. When I was brought up against the unthinkable through my thinking and what was unreachable through my thought power, then I could only press forward in a forced way. But I overloaded on one side, and the other side sank deeper. Overloading is not growth, which is what we need (p. 376).</p>
<p>179.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “26. 1. 1919.” The date appears to refer to when this section was transcribed into the calligraphic volume.</p>
<p>180.In 1930, Jung said in a seminar: “We are prejudiced in regard to the animal. People don’t understand when I tell them they should become acquainted with their animals or assimilate their animals. They think the animal is always jumping over walls and raising hell all over town. Yet in nature the animal is a well-behaved citizen. It is pious, it follows the path with great regularity, it does nothing extravagant. Only man is extravagant. So if you assimilate the character of the animal you become a peculiarly law-abiding citizen, you go very slowly, and you become very reasonable in your ways, in as much as you can afford it” (<em>Visions</em> 1, p. 168).</p>
<p>181.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has in the margin: “Rom 8 19” (p. 863). What follows in the text is a citation from Romans 8:19–22.</p>
<p>182.This is a citation from Isaiah 66:24.</p>
<p>183.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “We were led by a prophet, whose proximity to God had driven him insane. He raged blindly against Christianity in his sermon, but he was the champion of the dead who had appointed him their spokesman and resounding trumpet. He shouted in a deafening voice so that many would hear him, and the power of his language also burned those who resisted death. He preached the struggle against Christianity. This was good, too” (p. 387). The reference is to Nietzsche.</p>
<p>184.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “whose champion you are” (p. 388).</p>
<p>185.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “like that raving prophet who did not know whose cause he was promoting, but instead believed himself to be speaking on his own behalf and thought he was the will of destruction” (p. 388). The reference is to Nietzsche.</p>
<p>186.In 1930, Jung anonymously reproduced this image in “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’ ” as a mandala painted by a male patient during treatment. He described it as follows: “In the centre, the white light, shining in the firmament; in the first circle, protoplasmic life-seeds; in the second, rotating cosmic principles which contain the four primary colors; in the third and fourth, creative forces working inward and outward. At the cardinal points, the masculine and feminine souls, both again divided into light and dark” (<em>CW</em> 13, A6). He reproduced it again in 1952 in “Concerning mandala symbolism” and wrote: “Picture by a middle-aged man. In the center is a star. The blue sky contains golden clouds. At the four cardinal points we see human figures: at the top, an old man in the attitude of contemplation; at the bottom, Loki or Hephaestus with red, flaming hair, holding in his hands a temple. To the right and left are a light and dark female figure. Together they indicate four aspects of the personality, or four archetypal figures belonging, as it were, to the periphery of the self. The two female figures can be recognized without difficulty as the two aspects of the anima. The old man corresponds to the archetype of meaning, or of the spirit, and the dark chthonic figure to the opposite of the Wise Old Man, namely the magical (and sometimes destructive) Luciferian element. In alchemy it is Hermes Trismegistus versus Mercurius, the evasive ‘trickster.’ The circle enclosing the sky contains structures or organisms that look like protozoa. The sixteen globes painted in four colors just outside the circle derived originally from an eye motif and therefore stand for the observing and discriminating consciousness. Similarly, the ornaments in the next circle, all opening inward, are rather like vessels pouring out their content toward the center. [Fn: There is a similar conception in alchemy, in the Ripley Scrowle and its variants (<em>Psychology and Alchemy</em>, fig 257). There it is the planetary Gods who are pouring their qualities into the bath of rebirth.] On the other hand the ornaments along the rim open outward, as if to receive something from outside. That is, in the individuation process what were originally projections stream back ‘inside’ and are integrated into the personality again. Here, in contrast to Figure 25, ‘Above’ and ‘Below,’ male and female, are integrated, as in the alchemical hermaphrodite” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §682). On March 21, 1950, he wrote to Raymond Piper concerning the same image: “The other picture is by an educated man about 40 years old. He produced this picture also as an at-first unconscious attempt to restore order in the emotional state he was in which had been caused by an invasion of unconscious contents” (<em>Letters</em> 1, p. 550).</p>
<p>187.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Not one iota of Christian law is abrogated, but instead we are adding a new one: accepting the lament of the dead” (p. 390).</p>
<p>188.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “It is nothing other than common evil desire, nothing but everyday temptation, as long as you do not know that it is what the dead demand. But as long as you know about the dead, you will understand your temptation. As long as it is no more than evil desire, what can you do about it? Damn it, regret it, arise anew, only to stumble again and mock and loathe yourself, but definitely despise and pity yourself. But if you know what the dead demand, temptation will become the wellspring of your best work, indeed of the work of salvation: When Christ ascended after completing his work, he led those up with him who had died prematurely and incomplete under the law of hardship and alienation and raw violence. The lamentations of the dead filled the air at the time, and their misery became so loud that even the living were saddened, and became tired and sick of life and yearned to die to this world already in their living bodies. And thus you too lead the dead to their completion with your work of salvation” (pp. 390–91).</p>
<p>189.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “You employ old word magic to protect yourself through superstition for you are still a powerless child of the old wood. But we can see behind your word magic, and it is rendered feeble, and nothing protects you against the chaos other than acceptance” (p. 395).</p>

<p>192.In <em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious</em> (1928), Jung refers to a case of a man with paranoid dementia he encountered during his time at the Burghölzli who was in telephonic communication with the Mother of God (<em>CW</em> 7, §229).</p>
<p>193.Image legend: “This man of matter rises up too far in the world of the spirit, there the spirit bores through his heart with the golden ray. He falls with joy and disintegrates. The serpent, who is the evil one, could not remain in the world of the spirit.”</p>
<p>194.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “22.3.1919.” This seems to refer to when this passage was transcribed into the calligraphic volume.</p>
<p>195.In <em>Psychology and Religion</em> (1938), Jung commented on the symbolism of the world clock (<em>CW</em> 11, §110ff).</p>
<p>196.In Dante’s <em>Commedia</em>, the following lines are inscribed over the gates of Hell: “Abandon every hope, you who enter” (canto 3, line 9). See <em>The Divine Comedy of Dante Aligheri</em>, vol. 1., ed. and tr. Robert Durling (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 55.</p>
<p>197.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “For words are not merely words, but have meanings for which they are set. They attract these meanings like daimonic shadows” (p. 403).</p>
<p>198.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Once you have seen the chaos, look at your face: you saw more than death and the grave, you saw beyond and your face bears the mark of one who has seen chaos and yet was a man. Many cross over, but they do not see the chaos; however the chaos sees them, stares at them, and imprints its features on them. And they are marked forever. Call such a one mad, for that is what he is; he has become a wave and has lost his human side, his constancy” (p. 404).</p>
<p>199.The preceding sentence is crossed out in the <em>Corrected Draft</em>, and Jung has written in the margin: “ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ identification” (p. 405).</p>
<p>200.Jung elaborated on this issue many years later in <em>Answer to Job</em> (1952), where he studied the historical transformation of Judeo-Christian God images. A major theme in this is the continued incarnation of God after Christ. Commenting on the Book of Revelation, Jung argued that: “Ever since John the apocalyptist experienced for the first time (perhaps unconsciously) the conflict into which Christianity inevitably leads, mankind is burdened with this: God wanted and wants to become man” (<em>CW</em> 11, §739). In Jung’s view, there was a direct link between John’s views and Eckhart’s views: “This disturbing invasion engendered in him the image of the divine consort, whose image lives in every man: of the child, whom Meister Eckhart also saw in the vision. It was he who knew that God alone in his Godhead is not in a state of bliss, but must be born in the human soul. The incarnation in Christ is the prototype which is continually being transferred to the creature by the Holy Ghost” (Ibid., §741). In contemporary times, Jung gave great importance to the papal bull of the <em>Assumptio Maria</em>. He held that it “points to the <em>hieros gamos</em> in the Pleroma, and this in turn implies, as we have said, the future birth of the divine child, who, in accordance with the divine trend toward incarnation, will choose as his birthplace the empirical man. This metaphysical process is known as the <em>individuation process</em> in the psychology of the unconscious” (Ibid., §755). Through being identified with the continued incarnation of God in the soul, the process of individuation found its ultimate significance. On May 3, 1958, Jung wrote to Morton Kelsey: “The real history of the world seems to be the progressive incarnation of the deity” (<em>Letters</em> 2, p. 436).</p>
<p>201.Image legend: “The serpent fell dead unto the earth. And that was the umbilical cord of a new birth.” The serpent is similar to the serpent in Image 109. In <em>Black Book</em> 7 on January 27, 1922, Jung’s soul refers to images 109 and 111. His soul says: “the giant cloud of eternal night is awful. I see a yellow shining stroke on this cloud from the top left-hand corner in the irregular shape of a streak of lightning, and behind it an indeterminate reddish light in the cloud. It does not move. I see a dead black serpent lying beneath the cloud and the lightning. It does not move. Beneath the cloud I see a dead black serpent and the thunderbolt stuck in its head like a spear. A hand, as large as that of a God, has thrown the spear and everything has frozen to a gloomy image. What is it trying to say. Do you recall that image that you painted years ago, the one in which the black and red man with the black and white serpent is struck by the ray of God [i.e., image 109]? This image seems to follow that one, because afterward you also painted the dead serpent [i.e., image 111] and did you not behold a gloomy image this morning, of that man in the white robe and a black face, like a mummy?” I: “How now, what is this supposed to mean?” Soul: “It is an image of your self” (p. 57).</p>
<p>202.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “But who does this under the law of love will move beyond suffering, sit at the table with the anointed and behold God’s glory” (p. 406).</p>
<p>203.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “But God will come to those who take their suffering upon themselves under the law of love, and he will establish a new bond with them. For it is predicted that the anointed is supposed to return, but no longer in the flesh, but in the spirit. And just as Christ guided the flesh upward through the torment of salvation, the anointed of this time will guide the spirit upward through the torment of salvation” (p. 407).</p>
<p>204.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The lowest in you is the stone that the builders discarded. It will become the cornerstone. The lowest in you will grow like a grain of rice from dry soil, shooting up from the sand of the most barren desert, and rise and stand very tall. Salvation comes to you from the discarded. Your sun will rise from muddy swamps. Like all others, you are annoyed at the lowest in you because its guise is uglier than the image of yourself that you love. The lowest in you is the most despised and least valued, full of pain and sickness. He is despised so much that one hides one’s face from him, that he is held in no respect whatsoever, and it is even said that he does not exist because one is ashamed for his sake and despises oneself. In truth, it carries our sickness and is ridden with our pain. We consider him the one who is plagued and punished by God on account of his despicable ugliness. But he is wounded, and exposed to madness, for the sake of our own justice; he is crucified and suppressed for the sake of our own beauty. We leave him to punishment and martyrdom that we might have peace. But we will take his sickness upon ourselves, and salvation will come to us through our own wounds” (pp. 407–8). The first lines refer to Psalm 118:22. The passage echoes Isaiah 53, which Jung cited above, p. 118.</p>
<p>205.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Why should our spirit not take upon itself torment and restlessness for the sake of sanctification? But all this will come over you, for I already hear the steps of those who bear the keys to open the gates of the depths. The valleys and mountains that resound with the noise of battles, the lamentation arising from innumerable inhabited sites is the omen of what is to come. My visions are truth for I have beheld what is to come. But you are not supposed to believe me, because otherwise you will stray from your path, the right one, that leads you safely to your suffering that I have seen ahead. May no faith mislead you, accept your utmost unbelief, it guides you on your way. Accept your betrayal and infidelity, your arrogance and your better knowledge, and you will reach the safe and secure route that leads you to your lowest; and what you do to your lowest, you will do to the anointed. Do not forget this: Nothing of the law of love is abrogated, but much has been added to it. Cursed unto himself is he who kills the one capable of love in himself, for the horde of the dead who died for the sake of love is immeasurable, and the mightiest among these dead is Christ the Lord. Holding these dead in reverence is wisdom. Purgatory awaits those who murder the one in themselves who is capable of love. You will lament and rave against the impossibility of uniting the lowest in you with the law of those who love. I say to you: Just as Christ subjugated the nature of the physical to the spirit under the law of the word of the father, the nature of the spirit shall be subjugated to the physical under the law of Christ’s completed work of salvation through love. You are afraid of the danger; but know that where God is nearest, the danger is greatest. How can you recognize the anointed one without any danger? Will one ever acquire a precious stone with a copper coin? The lowest in you is what endangers you. Fear and doubt guard the gates of your way. The lowest in you is the unforeseeable for you cannot see it. Thus shape and behold it. You will thus open the floodgates of chaos. The sun arises from the darkest, dampest, and coldest. The unknowing people of this time only see the one; they never see the other approaching them. But if the one exists, so does the other” (pp. 409–10). Jung here implicitly cites the opening lines of Friedrich Hölderlin’s “Patmos,” which was one of his favorite poems: “Near is / the God, and hard to grasp. / But where danger is, / salvation also grows.” Jung discussed this in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912, CW B, §651f).</p>
<p>206.These lines actually cite Isaiah 63:2–6.</p>
<p>207.Matthew 10:34: “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.”</p>
<p>208.In <em>Answer to Job</em> (1952), Jung wrote of Christ on the cross: “This picture is completed by the two thieves, one whom goes down to hell, the other into paradise. One could hardly imagine a better representation of the oppositeness of the central Christian symbol” (<em>CW</em> 11, §659).</p>
<p>209.Dieterich notes that in Plato’s <em>Gorgias</em>, there is the motif that transgressors hang in Hades (<em>Nekyia</em>, p. 117). In Jung’s list of references at the back of his copy of <em>Nekyia</em>, he noted: “117 hanging.”</p>
<p>210.Matthew 10:16: “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”</p>
<p>211.Image legend: “This is the image of the divine child. It means the completion of a long path. Just as the image was finished in April 1919, and work on the next image had already begun, the one who brought the <img src="images/00007.jpeg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> came, as ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ [Philemon] had predicted to me. I called him ΦΑΝΗΣ [Phanes], because he is the newly appearing God.” <img src="images/00007.jpeg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> may be the astrological sign for the sun. In the Orphic theogony, Aither and Chaos are born from Chronos. Chronos makes an egg in Aither. The egg splits into two, and Phanes, the first of the Gods, appears. Guthrie writes that “he is imagined as marvelously beautiful, a figure of shining light, with golden wings on his shoulders, four eyes, and the heads of various animals. He is of both sexes, since he is to create the race of the gods unaided” (<em>Orpheus and Greek Religion: A Study of the Orphic Movement</em> [London: Methuen, 1935, p. 80). In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912) while discussing mythological conceptions of creative force, Jung drew attention to the “Orphic figure of Phanes, the ‘Shining One,’ the first-born, the ‘Father of Eros.’ In Orphic terms, Phanes also denotes Priapos, a god of love, androgynous, and equal to the Theban Dionysus Lysios. The Orphic meaning of Phanes is the same as that of the Indian Kâma, the God of love, which is also a cosmogonic principle” (<em>CW</em> B, §223). Phanes appears in <em>Black Book</em> 6 in the autumn of 1916. His attributes match the classical depictions, and he is described as the brilliant one, a God of beauty and light. Jung’s copy of Isaac Cory’s <em>Ancient Fragments of the Phoenician, Chaldean, Egyptian, Tryian, Carthaginian, Indian, Persian, and Other Writers; With an Introductory Dissertation; And an Inquiry into the Philosophy and Trinity of the Ancients</em> has underlinings in the section containing the Orphic theogony, and a slip of paper and mark by the following statement: “they imagine as the god a conceiving and conceived egg, or a white garment, or a cloud, because Phanes springs forth from these” ([London: William Pickering, 1832], p. 310). Phanes is Jung’s God. On September 28, 1916, Phanes is described as a golden bird (<em>Black Book</em> 6, p. 119). On February 20, 1917, Jung addresses Phanes as the messenger of Abraxas (Ibid., p. 167). On May 20, 1917, Philemon says that he will become Phanes (Ibid., p. 195). On September 11, Philemon describes him as follows: “Phanes is the God who rises agleam from the waters. / Phanes is the smile of dawn. / Phanes is the resplendent day. / He is the immortal present. / He is the gushing streams. / He is the soughing wind. / He is hunger and satiation. / He is love and lust. / He is mourning and consolation. / He is promise and fulfillment. / He is the light that illuminates every darkness. / He is the eternal day. / He is the silver light of the moon. / He is the flickering stars. / He is the shooting star that flashes and falls and lapses. / He is the stream of shooting stars that returns every year. / He is the returning sun and moon. / He is the trailing star that brings wars and noble wine. / He is the good and fullness of the year. / He fulfills the hours with life-filled enchantment. / He is love’s embrace and whisper. / He is the warmth of friendship. / He is the hope that enlivens the void. / He is the magnificence of all renewed suns. / He is the joy at every birth. / He is the blooming flowers. / He is the velvety butterfly’s wing. / He is the scent of blooming gardens that fills the nights. / He is the song of joy. / He is the tree of light. / He is perfection, everything done better. / He is everything euphonious. / He is the well-measured. / He is the sacred number. / He is the promise of life. / He is the contract and the sacred pledge. / He is the diversity of sounds and colors. / He is the sanctification of morning, noon, and evening. / He is the benevolent and the gentle. / He is salvation. . . / In truth, Phanes is the happy day. . . / In truth, Phanes is work and its accomplishment and its remuneration. / He is the troublesome task and the evening calm. / He is the step on the middle way, its beginning, its middle, and its end. / He is foresight. / He is the end of fear. / He is the sprouting seed, the opening bud. / He is the gate of reception, of acceptance and deposition. / He is the spring and the desert. / He is the safe haven and the stormy night. / He is the certainty in desperation. / He is the solid in dissolution. / He is the liberation from imprisonment. / He is counsel and strength in advancement. / He is the friend of man, the light emanating from man, the bright glow that man beholds on his path. / He is the greatness of man, his worth, and his force” (<em>Black Book</em> 7, pp. 16–9). On July 31, 1918, Phanes himself says: “The mystery of the summer morning, the happy day, the completion of the moment, the fullness of the possible, born from suffering and joy, the treasure of eternal beauty, the goal of the four paths, the spring and the ocean of the four streams, the fulfillment of the four sufferings and of the four joys, father and mother of the Gods of the four winds, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, and man’s divine enhancement, highest effect and nonbeing, world and grain, eternity and instance, poverty and abundance, evolution, death and the rebirth of God, borne by eternally creative power, resplendent in eternal effect, loved by the two mothers and sisterly wives, ineffable pain-ridden bliss, unknowable, unrecognizable, a hair’s breadth between life and death, a river of worlds, canopying the heavens—I give you philanthropy, the opal jug of water; he pours water and wine and milk and blood, food for men and Gods. / I give you the joy of suffering and suffering of joy. / I give you what has been found: the constancy in change and the change in constancy. / The jug made of stone, the vessel of completion. Water flowed in, wine flowed in, milk flowed in, blood flowed in. / The fours winds precipitated into the precious vessel. / The Gods of the four heavenly realms hold its curvature, the two mothers and the two fathers guard it, the fire of the North burns above its mouth, the serpent of the South encircles its bottom, the spirit of the East holds one of its sides and the spirit of the West the other. / Forever denied it exists forever. Recurring in all forms, forever the same, this one precious vessel, surrounded by the circle of animals, denying itself, and arising in new splendor through its self-denial. / The heart of God and of man. / It is the One and the Many. A path leading across mountains and valleys, a guiding star on the oceans, in you and always ahead of you. / Perfected, indeed truly perfected is he who knows this. / Perfection is poverty. But poverty means gratitude. Gratitude is love (2 August). / In truth, perfection is sacrifice. / Perfection is joy and anticipation of the shadow. / Perfection is the end. The end means the beginning, and hence perfection is both smallness and the smallest possible beginning. / Everything is imperfect, and perfection is hence solitude. But solitude seeks community. Hence perfection means community. / I am perfection, but perfected is only he who has attained his limits. / I am the eternal light, but perfect is he who stands between day and night. I am eternal love, but perfect is he who has placed the sacrificial knife beside his love. / I am beauty, but perfect is he who sits against the temple wall and mends shoes for money. / He who is perfect is simple, solitary, and unanimous. Hence he seeks diversity, community, ambiguity. Through diversity, community, and ambiguity he advances toward simplicity, solitude, and unanimousness. / He who is perfect knows suffering and joy, but I am the bliss beyond joy and suffering. / He who is perfect knows light and dark, but I am the light beyond day and darkness. / He who is perfect knows up and down, but I am the height beyond high and low. / He who is perfect knows the creating and the created, but I am the parturient image beyond creation and creature. / He who is perfect knows love and being loved, but I am the love beyond embrace and mourning. / He who is perfect knows male and female, but I am the One, his father and son beyond masculine and feminine, beyond child and the aged. / He who is perfect knows rise and fall, but I am the center beyond dawn and dusk. / He who is perfect knows me and hence he is different from me” (<em>Black Book</em> 7, pp. 76–80).</p>

<p>217.In the first act of the second part of Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, Faust has to descend to the realm of the Mothers. There has been much speculation concerning the meaning of this term in Goethe. To Eckermann, Goethe stated that the source for the name was from Plutarch. In all likelihood, this was Plutarch’s discussion of the Mother Goddesses in Engyon. (See Cryus Hamlin, ed., <em>Faust</em> [New York: W. W. Norton, 1976], pp. 328–29.) In 1958, Jung identified the realm of the Mothers with the collective unconscious (<em>A Modern Myth: Of Things That Were Seen in the Skies, CW</em> 10, §714).</p>

<p>221.In <em>Parsifal</em>, Wagner presented his reworking of the Grail legend. The plot runs as follows: Titurel and his Christian knights have the Holy Grail in their keeping in their castle, with a sacred spear to guard it. Klingsor is a sorcerer who seeks the Grail. He has enticed the keepers of the Grail into his magic garden, where there are flower maidens and the enchantress, Kundry. Amfortas, Titurel’s son, goes into the castle to destroy Klingsor but is enchanted by Kundry and lets the sacred spear fall, and Klingsor wounds him with it. Amfortas needs the touch of the spear to heal his wound. Gurnemanz, the oldest of the knights, looks after Kundry, not knowing her role in Amfortas’s wounding. A voice from the Grail sanctuary prophesies that only a youth who is guileless and innocent can regain the spear. Parsifal enters, having killed a swan. Not knowing his name or the name of his father, the knights hope that he is this youth. Gurnemanz takes him to Klingsor’s castle. Klingsor orders Kundry to seduce Parsifal. Parsifal defeats Klingsor’s knights. Kundry is transformed into a beautiful woman, and she kisses him. From this, he realizes that Kundry seduced Amfortas, and he resists her. Klingsor hurls the spear at him, and Parsifal seizes it. Klingsor’s castle and garden disappear. After wandering, Parsifal finds Gurnemanz, now living as a hermit. Parsifal is covered in black armor, and Gurnemanz is offended that he is armed on Good Friday. Parsifal lays his spear before him, and removes his helmet and arms. Gurnemanz recognizes him, and anoints him king of the knights of the Grail. Parsifal baptizes Kundry. They go into the castle and ask Amfortas to uncover the Grail. Amfortas asks them to slay him. Parsifal enters and touches his wound with the spear. Amfortas is transfigured, and Parsifal radiantly holds up the Grail. On May 16, 1913, Otto Mensendieck gave a presentation to the Zürich Psychoanalytical Society on “The Grail-Parsifal Saga.” In the discussion, Jung said: “Wagner’s exhaustive treatment of the legend of the Holy Grail and Parsifal would need to be supplemented with the synthetic view that the various figures correspond to various artistic aspirations.—The incest barrier will not serve to explain that Kundry’s ensnarement fails; instead this has to do with the activity of the psyche to elevate human aspirations ever higher” (<em>MZS</em>, p. 20). In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), Jung put forward a psychological interpretation of <em>Parsifal</em> (<em>CW</em> 6, §§371–72).</p>
<p>222.Text in image: (Atmavictu); (iuvenis adiutor) [a youthful supporter]; (ΤΕΛΕΣΦΟΡΟΣ) [TELESPHORUS]; (spiritus malus in homnibus quibusdam) [evil spirit in some men]. Image legend: “The dragon wants to eat the sun and the youth beseeches him not to. But he eats it nevertheless.” Atmaviktu (as spelled there) first appears in <em>Black Book</em> 6 in 1917. Here is a paraphrase of the fantasy of April 25, 1917: The serpent says that Atmaviktu was her companion for thousands of years. He was first an old man, and then he died and became a bear. Then he died and became an otter. Then he died and became a newt. Then he died again and came into the serpent. The serpent is Atmaviktu. He made a mistake before then and became a man, while he was still an earth serpent. Jung’s soul says that Atmaviktu is a kobold, a serpent conjuror, a serpent. The serpent says that she is the kernel of the self. From the serpent, Atmaviktu transformed into Philemon (p. 179f). There is a sculpture of him in Jung’s garden in Küsnacht. In “From the earliest experiences of my life” Jung wrote: “When I was in England in 1920, I carved two similar figures out of thin branch without having the slightest recollection of that childhood experience. One of them I had reproduced on a larger scale in stone, and this figure now stands in my garden in Küsnacht. It was only at that time that the unconscious supplied me with a name. It called the figure Atmavictu—the ‘breath of life.’ It is a further development of that quasi-sexual object of my childhood, which turned out to be the ‘breath of life,’ the creative impulse. Basically, the manikin is a kabir” (<em>JA</em>, pp. 29–30; cf. <em>Memories</em>, pp. 38–39). The figure of Telesphorus is like Phanes in Image 113. Telesphorus is one of the Cabiri, and the daimon of Aesclepius (see fig. 77, <em>Psychology and Alchemy</em>, <em>CW</em> 12). He was also regarded as a God of healing, and had a temple at Pergamon in Asia Minor. In 1950, Jung carved an image of him in his stone at Bollingen, together with a dedication to him in Greek, combining lines from Heraclitus, the Mithraic Liturgy, and Homer (<em>Memories</em>, p. 254).</p>
<p>223.In Book 11 of the <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus makes a libation to the dead to enable them to speak. Walter Burkert notes: “The dead drink the pourings and indeed the blood—they are invited to come to the banquet, to the satiation with blood; as the libations seep into the earth, so the dead will send good things up above” (<em>Greek Religion</em>, tr. J. Raffar [Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987], pp. 194–95). Jung had used this motif in a metaphorical sense in 1912 in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>: “like Odysseus, I have sought to allow this shade [Miss Frank Miller] to drink only as much so as to make it speak so it can give away some of the secrets of the underworld” (<em>CW</em> B, §57n). Around 1910, Jung went on a sailing trip with his friends Albert Oeri and Andreas Vischer, during which Oeri read aloud the chapters from the Odyssey dealing with Circe and the nekyia. Jung noted that shortly after this, he “like Odysseus, was presented by fate with a nekyia, the descent into the dark Hades” (Jung/Jaffé, <em>Erinnerungen, Träume, Gedanken</em>, p. 104). The passage which follows depicting the prophet’s revival of the child paraphrases Elisha’s revival of the son of the Shunammite widow in 2 Kings 4:32–36.</p>

<p>225.See above, note 135, p. 167.</p>
<p>226.Image legend: “The accursed dragon has eaten the sun, its belly being cut open and he must not hand over the gold of the sun, together with his blood. This is the turning back of Atmavictu, of the old one. He who destroyed the proliferating green covering is the youth who helped me to kill Siegfried.” The reference is to <em>Liber Primus</em>, ch. 7, “Murder of the Hero.”</p>
<p>227.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “I put many people, books, and thoughts aside for his sake; but even more, I withdrew from the current world and did the plain and simple, and what suggested it most immediately, to serve his secret purpose. By serving him, the dark one, I encounter another on the path of mercy. If intentions and wishes torment me, I think, feel, and do what lies closest. Thus what is most remote reaches me” (p. 434).</p>
<p>228.In 1944 in <em>Psychology und Alchemy</em>, Jung referred to an alchemical representation of a circle quadrated by four “rivers” in the context of a discussion of mandala symbolism (<em>CW</em> 12, §167n). Jung commented on the four rivers of paradise on a number of occasions—see, for instance, <em>Aion, CW</em> §§2, 9, 311, 353, 358, 372.</p>
<p>229.Inscription: “XI. MCMXIX. [11. 1919: This date seems to refer to when this image was painted.] This stone, set so beautifully, is certainly the Lapis Philosophorum. It is harder than diamond. But it expands into space through four distinct qualities, namely breadth, height, depth, and time. It is hence invisible and you can pass through it without noticing it. The four streams of Aquarius flow from the stone. This is the incorruptible seed that lies between the father and the mother and prevents the heads of both cones from touching: it is the monad which countervails the Pleroma.” On the pleroma, see below p. 509f. Concerning the reference to the incorruptible seed, see the dialogue with Ha in the note to image 94, p. 326, n. 157 above.</p>
<p>230.On June 3, 1918, Jung’s soul described Philemon as the joy of the earth: “The daimons become reconciled in the one who has found himself, who is the source of all four streams, of the source-bearing earth. From his summit waters flow in all four directions. He is the sea that bears the sun; he is the mountain that carries the sun; he is the father of all four great streams; he is the cross that binds the four great daimons. He is the incorruptible seed of nothingness, which falls accidentally through space. This seed is the beginning, younger than all other beginnings, older than all endings” (<em>Black Book</em> 7, p. 61). Some of the motifs in this statement may have some connections with this image. There is a gap between July 1919 and February 1920 in <em>Black Book</em> 7, during which time Jung was presumably writing <em>Psychological Types</em>. On February 23 he made the following entry: “What lies between appears in the book of dreams, but even more in the images of the red book” (p. 88). In “Dreams” Jung noted around eight dreams during this period, and a vision at night in August 1919 of two angels, a dark transparent mass, and a young woman. This suggests that the symbolic process continues in the paintings in the calligraphic volume, which do not appear to have direct cross-references to either the text in <em>Liber Novus</em> or the <em>Black Books</em>. In 1935, Jung put forward a psychological interpretation of the symbolism of medieval alchemy, viewing the philosopher’s stone—the goal of the alchemical opus—as a symbol of the self (<em>Psychology and Alchemy</em>, CW 12).</p>
<p>231.Inscription: “4 December MCMXIX. [December 4, 1919: This date seems to refer to when the image was painted.] This is the back side of the gem. He who is in the stone has this shadow. This is Atmavictu, the old one, after he has withdrawn from the creation. He has returned to endless history, where he took his beginning. Once more he became stony residue, having completed his creation. In the form of Izdubar he has outgrown and delivered ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and Ka from him. ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ gave the stone, Ka the <img src="images/00007.jpeg" alt="image" loading="lazy">.” The final character appears to be the astrological symbol for the sun.</p>
<p>232.On Atmavictu, see note to image 117. On May 20, 1917, Philemon said: “As Atmavictu I committed the error and became human. My name was Izdubar? I approached him as just that. He paralyzed me. Yes, man paralyzed me and turned me into a dragon’s serpent. Fortunately, I recognized my error, and the fire consumed the serpent. And thus Philemon came into being. My form is appearance. Previously, my appearance was form” (<em>Black Book</em> 7, p. 195). In <em>Memories</em>, Jung said: “Later, Philemon became relativized by yet another figure, whom I called Ka. In ancient Egypt the ‘King’s Ka’ was his earthly form, the embodied soul. In my fantasy the ka-soul came from below, out of the earth as out of a deep shaft. I did a painting of him, showing him in his earth-bound form, as a herm with base of stone and upper part of bronze. High up in the painting appears a kingfisher’s wing, and between it and the head of Ka floats a round, glowing nebula of stars. Ka’s expression has something demonic about it—one might also say Mephistophelian. In one hand he holds something like a colored pagoda, or a reliquary, and in the other a stylus with which he is working on the reliquary. He is saying, ‘I am he who buries the Gods in gold and gems.’ Philemon has a lame foot, but was a winged spirit, whereas Ka represented a kind of earth demon or metal demon. Philemon was the spiritual aspect, ‘the meaning,’ Ka, on the other hand was a spirit of nature like the Anthroparion of Greek alchemy—with which at that time I was still unfamiliar. Ka was he who made everything real, but who also obscured the kingfisher spirit, the meaning, or replaced it by beauty, the ‘eternal reflection.’ In time I was able to integrate both figures through the study of alchemy” (pp. 209–10). Wallace Budge notes that “The ka was an abstract individuality or personality which possessed the form and attributes of the man to whom it belonged, and, though its normal dwelling place was in the tomb with the body, it could wander at will; it was independent of the man and could go and dwell in any statue of him” (<em>Egyptian Book of the Dead</em>, p. lxv). In 1928, Jung commented: “At a rather higher stage of development, where the idea of the soul already exists, not all the images continue to be projected. . . but one or the other complex has come near enough to consciousness to be felt as no longer strange, but as somehow belonging. Nevertheless, the feeling that it belongs is not at first sufficiently strong for the complex to be sensed as a subjective content of consciousness. It remains in a sort of no-man’s-land between consciousness and the unconscious, in the half-shadow, in part belonging or akin to the conscious subject, in part an autonomous being, and meeting consciousness as such. At all events it is not necessarily obedient to the subject’s intentions, it may even be of a higher order, more often than not a source of inspiration or warning, or of supernatural information. Psychologically such a content could be explained as a partly autonomous complex that is not yet fully integrated. The primitive souls, the Egyptian Ba and Ka, are complexes of this kind” (<em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious, CW</em> 7, §295). In 1955/56, Jung described the Anthroparion in alchemy as “a type of goblin, that as πνευμα παρεδρον [devoted spirit], spiritus familiaris, stands by the adept in his work and helps the physician to heal” (<em>Mysterium Coniunctionis, CW</em> 14, §304). The Anthroparion was seen to represent the alchemical metals (“On the psychology of the Child archetype,” <em>CW</em> 9, 1, §268) and appeared in the visions of Zosimos (<em>CW</em> 13, pp. 60–62). The painting of Ka that Jung refers to has not come to light. Ka appeared to Jung in a fantasy on October 22, 1917, where he introduced himself as the other side of Ha, his soul. It was Ka who had given Ha the runes and the lower wisdom (see note 155, pp. 325–26). His eyes are of pure gold and his body is of black iron. He tells Jung and his soul that they need his secret, which is the essence of all magic. This is love. Philemon says that Ka is Philemon’s shadow (<em>Black Book</em> 7, p. 25ff). On November 20, Ka calls Philemon his shadow, and his herald. Ka says that he is eternal and remains, while Philemon is fleeting and passes on (p. 34). On February 10, 1918, Ka says that he has built a temple as a prison and grave for the Gods (p. 39). Ka features in <em>Black Book</em> 7 until 1923. During this period, Jung attempts to understand the connection among Ka, Philemon, and the other figures, and to establish the right relation to them. On October 15, 1920, Jung discussed an unidentified picture with Constance Long, who was in analysis with him. Some of the comments she noted shed light on his understanding of the relation of Philemon and Ka: “The 2 figures on either side are personifications of dominants ‘fathers.’ The one is the creative father, Ka, the other, Philemon that one whom gives form and law (the formative instinct) Ka would equal Dionysus &amp; P = Apollo. Philemon gives formulation to the things within elements of the collective unc. . . Philemon gives the idea (maybe of a god) but it remains floating, distant &amp; indistinct because all the things he invents are winged. But Ka gives substance &amp; is called the one who buries the gods in gold &amp; marble. He has a tendency to misprison them in matter, &amp; so they are in danger of losing their spiritual meaning, &amp; becoming buried in stone. So the temple maybe the grave of God, as the church has become the grave of Xt. The more the church develops, the more Xt dies. Ka must not be allowed to produce too much—you must not depend on substantiation; but if too little substance is produced the creature floats. The transcendent function is the whole. Not this picture, nor my rationalization of it, but the new and vivifying creative spirit that is the result of the intercourse between the consc. intelligence and the creative side. Ka is sensation, P is intuition, he is too supra-human (he is Zarathustra, extravagantly superior in what he says &amp; cold. [CGJ has not printed the questions he addressed to P nor his answers]. . . Ka &amp; Philemon are bigger than the man, they are supra-human (Disintegrated into them one is in the Col. Unc)” (Diary, Countway Library of Medicine, pp. 32–33).</p>
<p>233.Inscription: “IV Jan, MCMXX [January 4, 1920: This date seems to refer to when the image was painted.] This is the holy caster of water. The Cabiri grow out of the flowers which spring from the body of the dragon. Above is the temple.”</p>
<p>234.In <em>Black Book</em> 4, Jung noted: “Thereafter I walk on like a man who is tense, and who expects something new that he has never suspected before. I listen to the depths—warned, instructed, and undaunted—outwardly striving to lead a full human life” (p. 42).</p>
<p>235.These lines refer to the end of <em>Voltaire’s Candide</em>: “All that is well said—but we must cultivate our garden” (<em>Candide and Other Stories</em>, tr. R. Pearson [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1759/1998], pp. 392–93). Jung kept a bust of Voltaire in his study.</p>
<p>236.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “How can I fathom what will happen during the next eight hundred years, up to the time when the One begins his rule? I am speaking only of what is to come” (p. 440).</p>
<p>237.The scene in the landscape resembles one of Jung’s waking fantasies during his childhood in which Alsace is submerged by water, Basle is turned into a port, there is a ship with sails and a steamer, a medieval town, a castle with cannons and soldiers and inhabitants of the town, and a canal (<em>Memories</em>, p. 100).</p>
<p>238.January 23, 1914.</p>
<p>239.In <em>Ecce Homo</em>, Nietzsche wrote: “Every acquisition, every step forward in knowledge is the <em>result</em> of courage, of severity toward oneself, of cleanliness with respect to oneself” (tr. R. J. Hollingdale [Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1979], foreword 3, p. 34).</p>
<p>240.Inscription on top: “Amor triumphat.” Inscription at bottom: “This image was completed on 9 January 1921, after it had waited incomplete for 9 months. It expresses I know not what kind of grief, a fourfold sacrifice. I could almost choose not to finish it. It is the inexorable wheel of the four functions, the essence of all living beings imbued with sacrifice.” The functions are those of thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition, which Jung wrote about in <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921). On February 23, 1920, Jung noted in <em>Black Book</em> 7: “What occurs between the lover and the beloved is the entire fullness of the Godhead. Both are unfathomable riddles to each other. For who understands the Godhead? / But the God is born in solitude, from the secret / mystery of the individual. / The separation between life and love is the contradiction between solitude and togetherness” (p. 88). The next entry in <em>Black Book</em> 7 is on September 5, 1921. On March 4, 1920, Jung went to North Africa with his friend Hermann Sigg, returning on April 17.</p>
<p>241.In <em>Black Book</em> 4, Jung noted: [Soul:] “Tame your impatience. Only waiting will help you here.” [I:] “Waiting—I know this word. Hercules also found waiting troublesome when he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders.” [Soul:] “He had to await Atlas’s return and carried the weight of the world for the sake of the apples” (p. 60). The reference is to the eleventh labor of Hercules, in which he has to get the golden apples, which confer immortality. Atlas offered to get them for him, if he held up the world in the interim.</p>
<p>242.In Greek mythology, the Moirae, or three fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropus, spun and controlled the threads of human life. In Norse mythology, the norns spun the threads of fate at the foot of Yggsdrasil, the world tree.</p>
<p>243.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The power of the way is so great that it carries away others and ignites them. You do not know how this happens; hence it is best you call this effect magical” (p. 453).</p>
<p>244.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “which is represented as a serpent precisely on account of its particular nature” (p. 453).</p>
<p>245.This appears to refer to the magical circle, in which ritual acts are performed.</p>

<p>248.Inscription: “Completed on 25 November 1922. The fire comes out of Muspilli and grasps the tree of life. A cycle is completed, but it is the cycle within the world egg. A strange God, the unnameable God of the solitary, is incubating it. New creatures form from the smoke and ashes.” In Norse mythology Muspilli (or Muspelheim) is the abode of the Fire Gods.</p>

<p>251.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “the serpent of my way” (p. 460).</p>
<p>252.In <em>Black Book</em> 4, this is spoken by his soul. In this chapter and in <em>Scrutinies</em>, we find a shift in the attribution of some statements in the <em>Black Books</em> from the soul to the other characters. This textual revision marks an important psychological process of differentiating the characters, separating them out from one another, and disidentifying from them. Jung discussed this process in general in 1928, in <em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious</em>, ch. 7, “The technique for differentiation between the I and the figures of the unconscious” (<em>CW</em> 7). In <em>Black Book</em> 6, the soul explains to Jung in 1916: “If I am not conjoined through the uniting of the Below and the Above, I break down into three parts: the <em>serpent</em>, and in that or some other animal form I roam, living nature daimonically, arousing fear and longing. The <em>human soul</em>, living forever within you. The celestial soul, as such dwelling with the Gods, far from you and unknown to you, appearing in the form of a bird.” (Appendix C, p. 577). The textual changes that Jung makes among the soul, the serpent, and the bird from the <em>Black Books</em> in this chapter and in <em>Scrutinies</em> can be seen to be the recognition and differentiation of the threefold nature of the soul. Jung’s notion of the unity and multiplicity of the soul resembles Eckhart’s. In Sermon 52, Eckhart wrote: “the soul with her higher powers touches eternity, which is God, while her lower powers being in touch with time make her subject to change and biased toward bodily things, which degrade her” (<em>Sermons &amp; Treatises</em>, vol. 2, tr. M. O’C. Walshe [London: Watkins, 1981], p. 55). In Sermon 85, he wrote: “Three things prevent the soul from uniting with God. The first is that she is too scattered, and that she is not unitary: for when the soul is inclined toward creatures, she is not unitary. The second is when she is involved with temporal things. The third is when she is turned toward the body, for then she cannot unite with God” (Ibid., p. 264).</p>
<p>253.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “ ‘Why,’ you ask, ‘does man not want to reach himself?’ The raging prophet who preceded this time wrote a book about this and embellished it with a proud name. The book is about how and why man does not want to reach himself” (p. 461). The reference is to Nietzsche’s <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>.</p>
<p>254.See “The Last Supper,” <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, p. 294f.</p>
<p>255.In the last chapter of <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, “The sign,” when the higher men come to meet Zarathustra in his cave, “the lion started violently, suddenly turned away from Zarathustra, and leaped up to the cave, roaring fiercely” (p. 407). In 1926 Jung noted: “The roaring of the Zarathustrian lion drove all the ‘higher’ men who were clamoring for experience back again into the cavern of the unconscious. Hence his life does not convince us of his teaching” (<em>The Unconscious in Normal and Sick Psychic Life, CW</em> 7, §37).</p>
<p>256.Nietzsche ends <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> with the lines: “Thus spoke Zarathustra and left his cave, glowing and strong, like a morning sun emerging from behind dark clouds” (p. 336).</p>
<p>257.In Zarathustra’s prologue, a tightrope walker falls from a rope. Zarathustra says to the injured tightrope walker: “Your soul will be dead even before your body: therefore fear nothing any more!” (<em>Zarathustra</em>, §6, 48; as underlined in Jung’s copy, p. 22). In 1926 Jung argued that this was prophetic of Nietzsche’s own fate (<em>The Unconscious in Normal and Sick Psychic Life</em>,” <em>CW</em> 7, §36–44).</p>
<p>258.For Jung’s differentiation of the significance of signs and symbols, see <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921, <em>CW</em> 6, §814ff).</p>
<p>259.The mandrake is a plant whose roots bear some resemblance to the human figure, hence they have been used in magical rites. According to legend, they shriek when they are pulled from the ground. In “The philosophical tree” (1945), Jung noted that the magical mandrake “when tied to the tail of a black dog, shrieks when it is torn out of the earth” (<em>CW</em> 13, §410).</p>
<p>260.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Everything is forever the same and yet not, for the wheel rolls along on a long road. But the way leads through valleys and across mountains. The movement of the wheel and the eternal recurrence of its parts is essential to the carriage, but meaning lies in the way. Meaning is attained only through the wheel’s constant revolution and forward movement. The recurrence of the past is inherent in forward movement. This can only baffle the ignorant person. Ignorance makes us resist the necessary recurrence of the same, or greed allows the wheel to toss us up and away in its upward movement because we believe that we will rise ever higher with this part of the wheel. But we will not rise higher, but deeper; ultimately we will be at the very bottom. Thus praise standstill, since it shows you that you are not bound to the spokes like Ixion, but sit alongside the charioteer who will interpret the meaning of the way to you” (pp. 469–70). In Greek mythology, Ixion was the son of Ares. He tried to seduce Hera, and Zeus punished him by binding him to a fiery wheel that rolled unceasingly.</p>
<p>261.The notion that everything recurs is found in various traditions, such as Stoicism and Pythagoreanism, and features prominently in Nietzsche’s work. There has been much debate in Nietzsche studies as to whether it should primarily be understood as an ethical imperative of life affirmation or as cosmological doctrine. See Karl Löwith, <em>Nietzsche’s Doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence of the Same</em>, tr. J. Lomax (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997). Jung discusses this in 1934, <em>Nietzsche’s Zarathustra</em>, vol. 1, pp. 191–92.</p>
<p>262.The <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has instead: “<em>Tenth Adventure</em>” (p. 1061).</p>
<p>263.January 27, 1914.</p>
<p>264.In the <em>Metamorphoses</em>, Ovid tells the tale of Philemon and Baucis. Jupiter and Mercury wandered disguised as mortals, in the hill country of Phyrgia. They searched for somewhere to rest but were barred by a thousand homes. An old couple finally took them in. The couple had been married in their cottage in their youth, grew old together, and contentedly accepted their poverty. They prepared a meal for their guests. During the meal, the couple saw that the flagon automatically refilled itself as soon as it was emptied. In honor of their guests, the couple offered to kill their sole goose. The goose took refuge with the Gods, who said that it should not be killed. Jupiter and Mercury then revealed themselves and told the couple that their neighborhood would be punished, but that they would be spared. They asked the couple to climb the mountain with them. When they reached the top, the couple saw that the country surrounding their cottage had been flooded and only their cottage remained; it had been transformed into a temple with marble columns and a gold roof. The Gods asked what the couple would like, and Philemon replied that they would like to be their priests and serve in their shrine, and also that they could die at the same time. Their wish was granted, and as they died, they transformed into trees side by side. In Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> 2, act V, a wanderer, who had previously been saved by them, calls upon Philemon and Baucis. Faust was in the process of building a city on land reclaimed from the sea. Faust proceeds to tell Mephistopheles that he wants Philemon and Baucis moved. Mephistopheles and three mighty men go and burn the cottage, with Philemon and Baucis in it. Faust replies that he had only intended to exchange their dwelling. To Eckermann, Goethe recounted that “My Philemon and Baucis. . . have nothing to do with that renowned ancient couple or the tradition connected with them. I gave this couple the names merely to elevate the characters. The persons and relations are similar, and hence the use of the names has a good effect” (June 6, 1831, cited in Goethe, <em>Faust</em>, tr. W. Arndt [New York: Norton Critical Edition, 1976], p. 428). On June 7, 1955, Jung wrote a letter to Alice Raphael which refers to Goethe’s comments to Eckermann: “Ad <em>Philemon and Baucis</em>: a typical Goethean answer to Eckermann! trying to conceal his vestiges. <em>Philemon</em> (Φιλημα [philema] = kiss), the loving one, the simple old loving couple, close to the earth and aware of the Gods, the complete opposite to the Superman Faust, the product of the devil. Incidentally: in my tower at Bollingen is a hidden inscription: <em>Philemon sacrum Fausti poenitentia</em> [Philemon’s Sanctuary, Faust’s Repentance]. When I first encountered the archetype of the old wise man, he called himself <em>Philemon</em>. / In Alchemy Ph. and B. represented the artifex or vir sapiens and the soror mystica (Zosimos-Theosebeia, Nicolas Flamel-Péronelle, Mr. South and his daughter in the XIXth Cent.) and the pair in the <em>mutus liber</em> (about 1677)” (Beinecke Library, Yale University). On Jung’s inscription, see also his letter to Hermann Keyserling, January 2, 1928 (<em>Letters</em> 1, p. 49). On January 5, 1942, Jung wrote to Paul Schmitt, “I have taken over <em>Faust as my heritage</em>, and moreover as the advocate of Philemon and Baucis, who, unlike Faust the superman, are the hosts of the gods in a ruthless and godforsaken age” (<em>Letters</em> 1, pp. 309–10).</p>
<p>265.In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), in the course of a discussion of Faust, Jung wrote: “The magician has preserved in himself a trace of primordial paganism, he possesses a nature that is still unaffected by the Christian splitting, which means he has access to the unconscious, which is still pagan, where the opposites still lie in their original naïve state, beyond all sinfulness, but, if assimilated into conscious life, produce evil and good with the same primordial and consequently daimonic force. . . Therefore he is a destroyer as well as savior. This figure is therefore pre-eminently suited to become the symbol carrier for an attempt at unification” (<em>CW</em> 6, §316).</p>
<p>266.The sixth and seventh books of Moses (i.e., in addition to the five contained in the Torah) were published in 1849 by Johann Schiebel, who claimed that they came from ancient Talmudic sources. The work is a compendium of Kabbalistic magical spells, which has been enduringly popular.</p>
<p>267.The figure of Hermes Trismegistus was formed through the amalgamation of Hermes with the Egyptian God Thoth. <em>The Corpus Hermeticum</em>, a collection of largely alchemical and magical texts dating from the early Christian era but initially thought to have been much older, was ascribed to him.</p>
<p>268.In Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, Philemon speaks of his declining powers: “Older, I could not lend a hand [to the building of the dyke] / as once I did full well, / and with my powers ebbing / the waters were pushed back” (Ll. 11087–9).</p>
<p>269.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “Jan. 1924.” This seems to refer to when this passage was transcribed into the calligraphic volume. The writing at this point gets larger, with more space between the words. At this time, Cary Baynes commenced her transcription.</p>
<p>270.In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921) Jung wrote: “Reason can only give one equilibrium if one’s reason is already an equilibrating organ. . . As a rule, man needs the opposite of his actual condition to force him to find his place in the middle” (<em>CW</em> 6, §386).</p>
<p>271.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Magical practice hence falls into two parts: first, developing an understanding of chaos; and second, translating the essence into what can be understood” (p. 484).</p>
<p>272.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Reason takes up only a very small share of magic. This will offend you. Age and experience are needed. The rash desirousness and fear of youth, as well as its necessary virtuousness, disturb the secret interplay of God and the devil. You are then all too easily torn to one side or the other, blinded or paralyzed” (p. 484).</p>
<p>273.The reference is to the astrological conception of the Platonic month, or aeon, of Pisces, which is based on the precession of the equinoxes. Each Platonic month consists of one zodiacal sign, and lasts approximately 2,300 years. Jung discusses the symbolism attached to this in <em>Aion</em> (1951, <em>CW</em> 6, ch. 6). He notes that around 7 BC there was a conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, representing a union of extreme opposites, which would place the birth of Christ under Pisces. Pisces (Latin for “fishes” ) is known as the sign of the fish and is often represented by two fish swimming in opposite directions. On the Platonic months, see Alice Howell, <em>Jungian Synchronicity in Astrological Signs and Ages</em> (Wheaton, IL: Quest Books, 1990), p. 125f. Jung started studying astrology in 1911, in the course of his study of mythology, and learned to cast horoscopes (Jung to Freud, May 8, 1911, <em>The Freud/Jung Letters</em>, p. 421). In terms of Jung’s sources for the history of astrology, he cited Auguste Bouché-Leclercq’s <em>L’Astrologie Grecque</em> on nine occasions in his later work (Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1899).</p>
<p>274.This refers to the end of the Platonic month of Pisces and the beginning of the Platonic month of Aquarius. The precise dating of this is uncertain. In <em>Aion</em> (1951), Jung noted: “Astrologically the beginning of the next aeon, according to the starting point you select, falls between AD 2000 and 2200” (<em>CW</em> 9, 2, §149, note 88).</p>
<p>275.In <em>Aion</em> (1951), Jung wrote: “If, as seems probable, the aeon of the fishes is ruled by the archetypal motif of the ‘hostile brothers,’ then the approach of the next Platonic month, namely Aquarius, will constellate the problem of the union of opposites. It will then no longer be possible to write off evil as a mere <em>privatio boni</em>; its real existence will have to be recognized” (<em>CW</em> 9, §142).</p>
<p>276.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “The hibernal rains began with Christ. He taught mankind the way to Heaven. We teach the way to earth. Hence nothing has been removed from the Gospel, but only added to it” (p. 486).</p>
<p>277.The <em>Draft</em> continues: “Our striving focused on sagacity and intellectual superiority, and we hence developed all our cleverness. But the extraordinary extent of stupidity inherent in all men was disregarded and denied. But if we accept the other in us, we also evoke the particular stupidity of our nature. Stupidity is one of man’s strange hobbyhorses. There is something divine about it, and yet something of the megalomania of the world. Which is why stupidity is really large. It keeps away everything that could induce us to intelligence. It leaves everything not understood which is not naturally supposed to demand understanding. This particular stupidity occurs in thought and in life. Somewhat deaf, somewhat blind, it brings about necessary fate and keeps from us the virtuousness coupled with rationality. It is what separates and isolates the mixed seeds of life, affording us thus with a clear view of good and evil, and of what is reasonable and what not. But many people are logical in their lack of reason” (p. 487).</p>
<p>278.In this paragraph, Jung refers to the classical account of Philemon and Baucis from the <em>Metamorphoses</em>.</p>
<p>279.Contrast with John 1:5, where Christ is described as follows: “The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.”</p>
<p>280.Cf. Jung’s fantasy of June 1, 1916, where Philemon’s guest was Christ (see below, p. 551).</p>
<p>281.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “The bhagavadgita says: whenever there is a decline of the law and an increase in iniquity, then I put forth myself. For the rescue of the pious and for the destruction of the evildoers, for the establishment of the law I am born in every age.” The citation is from chapter 4, verses 7–8 of the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>. Krishna is instructing Arjuna concerning the nature of truth.</p>
<p>282.The text in the image reads: “Father of the Prophet, beloved Philemon.” Jung subsequently painted another version of this painting as a mural in one of the bedrooms in his tower at Bollingen. He added an inscription in Latin from the <em>Rosarium Philosophorum</em>, in which Hermes describes the stone as saying: “defend me and I will defend thee, give me my right that I may help thee, for Sol is mine and the beams thereof are my inward parts; but Luna is proper to me, and my light excelleth all light, and my goods are higher than all goods. I give many riches and delights to men desiring them, and when I seek after anything they acknowledge it, I make them understand and I cause them to possess divine strength. I engender light, but my nature is darkness. Unless my metal should be dry, all bodies have need of me, because I moisten them. I blot out their rustiness and extract their substance. Therefore I and my son being joined together, there can be nothing made better nor more honorable in the whole world.” Jung cited some of these lines in <em>Psychology and Alchemy</em> (1944, <em>CW</em> 12, §§99, 140, 155). The <em>Rosarium</em>, first published in 1550, was one of the most important texts of European alchemy, and concerns the means of producing the philosopher’s stone. It contained a series of woodcuts of symbolic figures, which was Jung’s exemplar in <em>Psychology of the Transference. Explained through an Alchemical Series of Pictures. For Doctors and Practical Psychologists</em> (1946, <em>CW</em> 16).</p>
<p>283.In “The psychological aspects of the Kore” (1951), Jung anonymously described this image as “xi. Then she [the anima] appears in a church, taking the place of the altar, still over-life-size but with veiled face.” He commented: “Dream xi restores the anima to the Christian church, not as an icon but as the altar itself. The altar is the place of sacrifice and also the receptacle for consecrated relics” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §369, 380). On the left-hand side, there is the Arabic word for “daughters.” On the border of the image is the following inscription: “Dei sapientia in mysterio quae abscondita est, quam praedestinavit ante secula in gloriam nostrum quam nemo princip[i]um huius seculi cognovit. Spiritus enim omnia scrutatur etiam profundo dei.” This is a citation from 1 Corinthians 2:7–10. (Jung has omitted “Deus” before “ante secula.” ) The portions cited are marked here in italics: “But we speak <em>the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of the world knew</em>: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: <em>for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</em>” On either side of the arch is the following inscription: “Spiritus et sponsa dicunt veni et qui audit dicat veni et qui sitit veniat qui vult accipiat aquam vitae gratis.” The text is from Revelation 22:17: “the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” Above the arch is the following inscription: “ave virgo virginum [Hail, virgin of virgins].” This is the title of a medieval hymn.</p>
<p>284.January 29, 1914.</p>
<p>285.From this point in the calligraphic volume, Jung’s coloring of red and blue initials becomes less consistent. Some have been added here for consistency.</p>
<p>286.This line is not in <em>Black Book</em> 4, where the voice is not identified as the serpent.</p>
<p>287.January 31, 1914.</p>
<p>288.In <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em> (1955/56), Jung noted: “If the projected conflict is to be healed, it must return into the soul of the individual, where it had its beginnings in an unconscious manner. He who wants to be the master of this descent must celebrate a Last Supper with himself, and eat his own flesh and drink his own blood; which means that he must recognize and accept the other in himself” (<em>CW</em> 14, §512).</p>
<p>289.Cf. Isaiah 11:6: “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.”</p>
<p>290.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “XIV AUG. 1925.” This appears to refer to when this passage was transcribed into the calligraphic volume. In the autumn of 1925, Jung went to Africa, together with Peter Baynes and George Beckwith. They left England on October 15, and he arrived back in Zürich on March 14, 1926.</p>
<p>291.The twelfth-century tale of the adulterous romance between the Cornish knight Tristan and the Irish princess Isolde has been retold in many versions, up to Wagner’s opera, which Jung referred to as an example of the visionary mode of artistic creation (“Psychology and poetry,” 1930, <em>CW</em> 15, §142).</p>

<p>295.Cf. <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), <em>CW</em> B, §585.</p>
<p>296.Image legend: “9 January 1927 my friend Hermann Sigg died age 52.” Jung described this as “A luminous flower in the center, with stars rotating about it. Around the flower, walls with eight gates. The whole conceived as a transparent window.” This mandala was based on a dream noted on January 2, 1927 (see above, p. 85). From the “town map” that Jung drew, the relation between the dream and the painting is clear. He anonymously reproduced this in 1930 in “Commentary to the ‘Secret of the Golden Flower,’ ” from which this description is taken. He reproduced it again in 1952, and added the following commentary: “The rose in the center is depicted as a ruby, its outer ring being conceived as a wheel or a wall with gates (so that nothing can come out from inside or go in from outside). The mandala was a spontaneous product from the analysis of a male patient.” After narrating the dream, Jung added: “The dreamer went on: ‘I tried to paint this dream. But as so often happens, it came out rather different. The magnolia turned into a sort of rose made of ruby-colored glass. It shone like a four-rayed star. The square represents the wall of the park and at the same time a street leading round the park in a square. From it there radiate eight main streets, and from each of these eight side-streets, which meet in a shining red central point, rather like the Étoile in Paris. The acquaintance mentioned in the dream lived in a house at the corner of one of these stars.’ The mandala thus combines the classic motifs of flower, star, circle, precinct (temenos), and plan of city divided into quarters with citadel. ‘The whole thing seemed like a window opening on to eternity,’ wrote the dreamer” (“Concerning mandala symbolism,” <em>CW</em> 9, 1, §654–55). In 1955/56 he used this same expression to denote the illustration of the self (<em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em>, <em>CW</em> 14, §763). On October 7, 1932, Jung showed this mandala in a seminar, and commented on it the next day. In this account, he states that the painting of the mandala <em>preceded</em> the dream: “You remember possibly the picture that I showed you last evening, the central stone and the little jewels round it. It is perhaps interesting if I tell you about the dream in connection with it. I was the perpetrator of that mandala at a time when I had not the slightest idea what a mandala was, and in my extreme modesty I thought, I am the jewel in the center and those little lights are surely very nice peosple who believe that they are also jewels, but smaller ones. . . I thought very well of myself that I was able to express myself like that: my marvelous center here and I am right in my heart.” He added that at first he did not recognize that the park was the same as the mandala which he had painted, and commented: “Now Liverpool is the center of life—liver is the center of life—and I am not the center, I am the fool who lives in a dark place somewhere, I am one of those little side lights. In that way my Western prejudice that I was the center of the mandala was corrected—that I am everything, the whole show, the king, the god” (<em>The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga</em>, p. 100). In <em>Memories</em>, Jung added some further details (pp. 223–24).</p>

<p>307.Image legend: “1928. When I painted this image, which showed the golden well-fortified castle, Richard Wilhelm sent me from Frankfurt the Chinese, thousand-year-old text of the golden castle, the embryo of the immortal body. Ecclesia catholic et protestantes et seclusi in secreto. Aeon finitus. (The Catholic church and the Protestants and those secluded in secret. The end of an aeon.) Jung described this as: A mandala as a fortified city with wall and moat. Within, a broad moat surrounding a wall fortified with sixteen towers and with another inner moat. This moat encloses a central castle with golden roofs whose centre is a golden temple. He anonymously reproduced this in 1930 in “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower,’ ” from which this description is taken. He reproduced it again in 1952 in “Concerning mandala symbolism” and added the following commentary: “Painting of a medieval city with walls and moats, streets and churches, arranged quadratically. The inner city is again surrounded by walls and moats, like the Imperial City in Peking. The buildings all open inward, toward the center, represented by a castle with a golden roof. It too is surrounded by a moat. The ground round the castle is laid with black and white tiles, representing the united opposites. This mandala was done by a middle-aged man. . . A picture like this is unknown in Christian symbolism. The Heavenly Jerusalem of Revelation is known to everybody. Coming to the Indian world of ideas, we find the city of Brahma on the world mountain, Meru. We read in the <em>Golden Flower: ‘The Book of the Yellow Castle</em> says: “In the square inch field of the square foot house, life can be regulated.” The square foot house is the face. The square inch field in the face: what could that be other than the heavenly heart? In the middle of the square inch dwells the splendor. In the purple hall of the city of Jade dwells the God of Utmost Emptiness and Life.’ The Taoists call this center ‘the land of ancestors or golden castle’ ” (<em>CW</em> 9, 1, §691). On this mandala, see John Peck, <em>The Visio Dorothei: Desert Context, Imperial Setting, Later Alignments: Studies in the Dreams and</em> <em>Visions of Saint Pachomius and Dorotheus, Son of Quintus,</em> Thesis, C.

Friedrich Creuzer and Schelling held them to be the primal deities of Greek mythology, from which all others developed (<em>Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker</em> [Leipzig: Leske, 1810–23]; <em>The Deities of Samothrace</em> [1815], introduced and translated by R. F. Brown [Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1977]). Jung had copies of both of these works. They appear in Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, part 2, act 2. Jung discussed the Cabiri in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912, CW B §209–11). In 1940 Jung wrote: “The Cabiri are, in fact, the mysterious creative powers, the gnomes who work under the earth, i.e., below the threshold of consciousness, in order to supply us with lucky ideas. As imps and hobgoblins, however, they also lay all sorts of nasty tricks, keeping back names and dates that were ‘on the tip of the tongue,’ making us say the wrong thing, etc. They give an eye to everything that has not already been anticipated by consciousness and the functions at its disposal. . . deeper insight will show that the primitive and archaic qualities of the inferior function conceal all sorts of significant relationships and symbolic meanings, and instead of laughing off the Cabiri as ridiculous Tom Thumbs he may begin to suspect that they are a treasure-house of hidden wisdom” (“Attempt at a psychological interpretation of the dogma of the trinity,” <em>CW</em> 11, §244). Jung commented on the Cabiri scene in <em>Faust</em> in <em>Psychology and Alchemy</em> (1944, <em>CW</em> 12, §203f). The dialogue with the Cabiri that takes place here is not found in <em>Black Book</em> 4, but is in the <em>Handwritten Draft</em>. It may have been written separately; if so it would have been written prior to the summer of 1915.</p>
<p>311.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “Thereupon I laid this matter aside for three weeks.”</p>
<p>312.In “Transformation symbolism in the mass” (1941), Jung noted that the motif of the sword played an important role in alchemy and discussed its significance as an instrument of sacrifice, its divisive and separative functions. He noted that “The alchemical sword brings about the solutio or separatio elementorum, thereby restoring the original condition of chaos, so that a new and more perfect body can be produced by a new impressio formae or imaginatio” (<em>CW</em> 11, §357 &amp; ff.).</p>
<p>313.The notion here of overcoming madness is close to Schelling’s distinction between the person who is overcome by madness and the person who manages to govern madness (see note 89, p. 149).</p>
<p>314.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “accipe quod tecum est. in collect. Mangeti in ultimis paginis” (Accept what is present. In the last pages of the Mangeti collection). It seems that this refers to the <em>Bibliotheca chemica curiosa, seu rerum ad alchemiam pertinentium thesaurus instructissimus</em> of J. J. Manget (1702), a collection of alchemical texts. Jung possessed a copy of this work, which has some slips of paper in it and some underlinings. Jung’s note possibly refers to the last woodcut of the <em>Mutus Liber</em>, which concludes volume one of the <em>Bibliotheca chemica curiosa</em>, a representation of the completion of the alchemical opus, with a man being lifted upward by angels, while another lies prostrate.</p>
<p>315.In <em>Psychological Types</em>, Jung commented on the symbolism of the tower in his discussion of the vision of the tower in <em>The Shepherd of Hermas</em> (<em>CW</em> 6, §390ff). In 1920, Jung began planning his tower at Bollingen.</p>
<p>316.February 2, 1914.</p>
<p>317.<em>Black Book</em> 4 has: “soul” (p. 110).</p>
<p>318.In Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, Mephistopheles makes a pact with Faust that he will serve him in life on condition that Faust will serve him in the beyond (l. 1655).</p>
<p>319.The <em>Corrected</em> <em>Draft</em> has instead: “me with the serpent” (p. 521).</p>
<p>320.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “I still did not realize that I myself was this murderer.”</p>
<p>321.February 9, 1914. <em>Black Book</em> 4 has: “soul” (p. 114).</p>
<p>322.Polygamy used to be practiced in Turkey. It was officially banned by Ataturk in 1926.</p>
<p>323.Jung’s marginal note to the calligraphic volume: “In XI Cap. of the mystery play” (see above, p. 194).</p>
<p>324.<em>Black Book</em> 4 continues: “I: My principles—it sounds stupid—forgive me—but I have principles. Do not think these are stale moral principles, for these are insights that life has imposed on me. / Serpent: What principles are these?” (pp. 121–22).</p>
<p>325.The issue of master and slave morality featured prominently in the first essay of Nietzsche’s <em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em> (tr. D. Smith [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996]).</p>
<p>326.In the calligraphic volume, there is a blank space for a historiated initial.</p>
<p>327.February 11, 1914.</p>
<p>328.In <em>Black Book</em> 4, this figure is identified as “soul” (p. 131).</p>
<p>329.This sentence is added in the <em>Draft</em>, p. 533.</p>
<p>330.The transcription in the calligraphic volume of <em>Liber Novus</em> ends at this point. What follows here is transcribed from the <em>Draft</em>, pp. 533–56.</p>
<p>331.This is a quotation from I Corinthians 13:8. Near the end of his life, Jung cited it again in his reflections on love at the end of <em>Memories</em> (p. 387). In <em>Black Book</em> 4, the inscription is first given in Greek letters (p. 134).</p>
<p>332.This sentence is added in the <em>Draft</em> (p. 534).</p>
<p>333.This figure is not identified as the serpent in <em>Black Book</em> 4.</p>
<p>334.In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung commented on the motif of hanging in folklore and mythology (<em>CW</em> B, §358).</p>
<p>335.There is a passage missing in <em>Black Book</em> 4, covering the end of this dialogue and the next paragraph.</p>
<p>336.Swedenborg described heavenly love as “loving uses for the sake of uses, or goods for the sake of goods, which a man performs for the Church, his country, human society, and a fellow-citizen,” differentiating it from self love and love of the world (<em>Heaven and Its Wonders and Hell: From Things Heard and Seen</em>, tr. J. Rendell [London: Swedenborg Society, 1920], §554f).</p>
<p>337.In the biblical account of creation, the sea and the land were separated on the third day.</p>
<p>338.John Keats’s poem “Ode to a Grecian Urn” ends with these lines: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”</p>
<p>339.In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912, <em>CW</em> B), Jung argued that in the course of psychological development, the individual had to free himself from the figure of the mother, as depicted in heroic myths (see ch. 6, “The battle for deliverance from the mother” ).</p>
<p>340.In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), while discussing his concept of libido, Jung referred to the cosmogonic significance of Eros in Hesiod’s <em>Theogony</em>, which he linked with the figure of Phanes in Orphism and with Kama, the Hindu God of love (<em>CW</em> B, §223).</p>
<p>341.In his later work, Jung gave importance to “enantiodromia,” the principle that everything turns into its opposite, which he attributed to Heraclitus. See <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), <em>CW</em> 6, §708f.</p>
<p>342.In the biblical account of the flood, the ark came to rest on Mount Ararat (Genesis 8:4). Ararat is a dormant volcanic cone formerly in Armenia (now Turkey).</p>
<p>343.In Norse mythology, Odin was pierced by a spear and hung from the world tree, Yggdrasill, where he hung for nine nights until he found the runes, which gave him power.</p>
<p>344.February 23, 1914. In <em>Black Book</em> 4, the dialogue is with the soul, and this section begins with Jung asking her what is stopping him from getting back to his work, and she tells him that it is his ambition, He thought he had overcome it, but she said that he had simply negated it, and thus tells him the tale that follows (p. 171). On February 13, 1914, Jung gave a talk, “On dream symbolism,” to the Zürich Psychoanalytical Society. From March 30 to April 13, Jung vacationed in Italy.</p>
<p>345.<em>Black Book</em> 4 has: “ambition” (p. 180).</p>
<p>346.<em>Black Book</em> 4 has “work” instead of “son” in the next few lines (p. 180).</p>
<p>347.April 19, 1914. The preceding paragraph was added in the <em>Draft</em>.</p>
<p>348.In <em>Black Book</em> 5, this dialogue is with his soul (p. 29f).</p>
<p>349.<em>Black Book</em> 5 has instead “Soul” (p. 37).</p>
<p>350.<em>Black Book</em> 5 has instead “with my soul” (p. 38).</p>
<p>351.This paragraph was added in the <em>Draft</em>.</p>
<p>352.The <em>Corrected Draft</em> has instead: “to myself” (p. 555).</p>
<p>353.The remainder is added in the <em>Draft</em> (p. 555f).</p>
<p>354.In 1930, Jung stated: “A movement back into the Middle Ages is a sort of regression, but it is not personal. It is a historical regression, a regression into the past of the collective unconscious. This always takes place when the way ahead is not free, when there is an obstacle from which you recoil; or when you need to get something out of the past in order to climb over the wall ahead” (<em>Visions</em>, vol. 1, p. 148). Around this time, Jung began working intensively on medieval theology (see <em>Psychological Types</em> [1921], <em>CW</em> 6, ch. 1, “The type problem in the history of the mind in antiquity and the Middle Ages” ).</p>
<p>355.At this point, the <em>Handwritten Draft</em> has: “Finis,” surrounded by a box (p. 1205).</p>
<p>Scrutinies</p>
<p>Scrutinies</p>
<p>{1} I resist, I cannot accept this hollow nothing that I am. What am I? What is my I? I always presuppose my I. Now it stands before me—I before my I. I speak now to you, my I:</p>
<p>1We are alone and our being together threatens to become unbearably boring. We must do something, devise a pastime; for example, I could educate you. Let us begin with your main flaw, which strikes me first: you have no correct self-esteem. Have you no good qualities that you can be proud of? You believe that being capable is an art. But one can also learn such skills to some extent. Please, do so. You find it difficult—well, all beginnings are difficult.2 Soon you will be able to do it better. Do you doubt this? That is of no use; you must be able to do it, or else I cannot live with you. Ever since the God has arisen and spreads himself in whichever fiery heavens, to do whatever he does, what exactly I do not know, we have depended upon one another. Therefore you must think about improving, or else our life together will become wretched. So pull yourself together and value yourself! Don’t you want to?</p>
<p>Pitiful creature! I will torment you a bit if you do not make an effort. What are you moaning about? Perhaps the whip will help?</p>
<p>Now that gets under your skin, doesn’t it? Take that—and that. What does it taste of? Of blood, presumably? Of the Middle Ages <em>in majorem Dei gloriam</em>?3</p>
<p>Or do you want love, or what goes by that name? One can also teach with love, if blows do not bear fruit. So should I love you? Press you tenderly to myself?</p>
<p>I truly believe that you are yawning.</p>
<p>How now, you want to speak? But I won’t let you, otherwise in the end you will claim that you are my soul. But my soul is with the fire worm, with the son of the frog who has flown to the heavens above, to the upper sources. Do I know what he is doing there? But you are not my soul, you are my bare, empty nothing—I, this disagreeable being, whom one cannot even deny the right to consider itself worthless.</p>
<p>One could despair over you: your sensitivity and desirousness exceed any reasonable measure. And I should live with you, of all people? I must, since the strange misfortune occurred that gave me a son and took him away.</p>
<p>I regret that I must speak such truths to you. Yes, you are laughably sensitive, self-righteous, unruly, mistrustful, pessimistic, cowardly, dishonest with yourself, venomous, vengeful; one can hardly speak about your childish pride, your craving for power, your desire for esteem, your laughable ambition, your thirst for fame without feeling sick. The playacting and pomposity become you badly and you abuse them to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>Do you believe that it is a pleasure rather than a horror to live together with you? No, three times no! But I promise you that I will tighten the vise around you and slowly pull off your skin. I will give you the chance to be flayed.</p>
<p>You, you of all people wanted to tell other people what to do?</p>
<p>Come here, I will stitch a cloth of new skin onto you, so that you can feel its effect.</p>
<p>You want to complain about others, and that one has done an injustice to you, not understood you, misinterpreted you, hurt your feelings, ignored you, not recognized you, falsely accused you, and what else? Do you see your vanity in this, your eternally ridiculous vanity?</p>
<p>You complain that the torment has not yet come to an end?</p>
<p>Let me tell you: it has only just begun. You have no patience and no seriousness. Only when it concerns your pleasure do you praise your patience. I will double the torment so that you learn patience.</p>
<p>You find the pain unbearable, but there are other things that hurt even more, and you can inflict them on others with the greatest naivety and absolve yourself all unknowingly.</p>
<p>But you will learn silence. For this I will pull out your tongue—with which you have ridiculed, blasphemed and—even worse—joked. I will pin all your unjust and depraved words one by one to your body with needles so that you can feel how evil words stab.</p>
<p>Do you admit that you also derive pleasure from this torment? I will increase this pleasure until you vomit with joy so that you know what taking pleasure in self-torment means.</p>
<p>You rise against me? I am screwing the vise tighter, that’s all. I will break your bones until there is no longer a trace of hardness there.</p>
<p>For I want to get along with you—I must—damn you—you are my I, which I must carry around with me to the grave. Do you think that I want to have such foolishness around me all my life? If you were not my I, I would have torn you to pieces long ago.</p>
<p>But I am damned to haul you through a purgatory so that you too will become somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p>You call on God for help?</p>
<p>The dear old God has died,4 and it is good that way, otherwise he would have had pity on your repentant sinfulness and spared me the execution by granting mercy. You must know that neither a God of love nor a loving God has yet arisen, but instead a worm of fire crawled up, a magnificent frightful entity that lets fire rain on the earth, producing lamentations.5 So cry to the God, he will burn you with fire for the forgiveness of your sins. Coil yourself and sweat blood. You have needed this cure for a long time. Yes—others always do wrong—and you? You are the innocent, the correct, you must defend your good right and you have a good, loving God on your side, who always forgives sins with pity. Others must reach insight, not you, since you have a monopoly on all insight from the start and are always convinced that you are right. And so cry really loudly to your dear God—he will hear you and let fire fall on you. Have you not noticed that your God has become a fiery worm with a flat skull who crawls red-hot on the earth?</p>
<p>You wanted to be superior! How laughable. You were, and are, inferior. Who are you, then? Scum that disgusts me.</p>
<p>Are you perhaps somewhat powerless? I place you in a corner where you can remain lying until you come to your senses again. If you no longer feel anything, the procedure is of no use. After all, we must proceed skillfully. It really says a lot about you that one needs such barbaric means for your amendment. Your progress since the early Middle Ages appears to be minuscule.</p>
<p>6Did you feel dejected today, inferior, debased? Shall I tell you why?</p>
<p>Your inordinate ambition is boundless. Your grounds are not focused on the good of the matter but on your vanity. You do not work for humanity but for your self-interest. You do not strive for the completion of the thing but for the general recognition and safeguarding of your own advantage. I want to honor you with a prickly crown of iron; it has teeth inside that bore themselves into your flesh.</p>
<p>And now we come to the vile swindle that you pursue with your cleverness. You speak skillfully and abuse your capability and discolor, tone down, strengthen, apportion light and shade, and loudly proclaim your honorableness and upright good faith. You exploit the good faith of others, you gloatingly catch them in your snares and speak of your benevolent superiority and the prize that you are for others. You play at modesty and do not mention your merit, in the certain hope that someone else will do it for you; you are disappointed and hurt if this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>You preach hypocritical composure. But when it really matters, are you calm? No, you lie. You consume yourself in rage and your tongue speaks cold daggers and you dream of revenge.</p>
<p>You are gloating and resentful. You begrudge the other the sunshine, since you would like to assign it to those whom you favor because they favor you. You are envious of all well-being around you and you impertinently assert the opposite.</p>
<p>Inside yourself you think unsparingly and coarsely only what always suits you, and with this you feel yourself above humanity and not in the least responsible. But you are responsible to humanity in everything that you think, feel, and do. Do not pretend there is a difference between thinking and doing. You rely only on your undeserved advantage, not to be compelled to say or do what you think and feel.</p>
<p>But you are shameless in everything where no one sees you. If another said that to you, you would be mortally offended, despite knowing that it is true. You want to reproach others for their failings? So that they better themselves? Yes, confess, have you bettered yourself? From where do you get the right to have opinions of others? What is your opinion about yourself? And what are the good grounds that support it? Your grounds are webs of lies covering a dirty corner. You judge others and charge them with what they should do. You do this because you have no order within yourself, because you are unclean.</p>
<p>And then—how do you really think? It appears to me that you even think with men, regardless of their human dignity; you dare think by means of them, and use them as figures on your stage, as if they were how you conceive them? Have you ever considered that you thus commit a shameful act of power, as bad as that for which you condemn others, namely that they love their fellow men, as they claim, but in reality exploit them to their own ends. Your sin flourishes in seclusion, but it is no less great, remorseless, and coarse.</p>
<p>What is concealed in you I will drag out into the light, shameless one! I will crush your superiority under my feet.</p>
<p>Do not speak to me about your love. What you call love oozes with self-interest and desirousness. But you speak about it with great words, and the greater your words are, the more pathetic your so-called love is. Never speak to me of your love, but keep your mouth shut. It lies.</p>
<p>I want you to speak about your shame, and that instead of speaking great words, you utter a discordant clamor before those whose respect you wanted to exact. You deserve mockery, not respect.</p>
<p>I will burn out of you the contents of which you were proud, so that you will become empty like a poured-out vessel. You should be proud of nothing more than your emptiness and wretchedness. You should be a vessel of life, so kill your idols.</p>
<p>Freedom does not belong to you, but form; not power, but suffering and conceiving.</p>
<p>You should make a virtue out of your self-contempt, which I will spread out before men like a carpet. They should walk over it with dirty feet and you should see to it that you are dirtier than all the feet that step on you.</p>
<p>7If I tame you, beast, I give others the opportunity to tame their beasts. The taming begins with you, my I, nowhere else. Not that you, stupid brother I, had been particularly wild. There are some who are wilder. But I must whip you until you endure the wildness of the others. Then I can live with you. If someone does you wrong, I will torment you to death, until you have forgiven the wrong suffered, yet not just by paying lip service, but also in your heavy heart with its heinous sensitivity. Your sensitivity is your particular form of violence.</p>
<p>Therefore listen, brother in my solitude, I have prepared every kind of torture for you, if it should ever occur to you again to be sensitive. You should feel inferior. You should be able to bear the fact that one calls your purity dirty and that one desires your dirtiness, that one praises your wastefulness as miserliness and your greed as a virtue.</p>
<p>Fill your beaker with the bitter drink of subjugation, since you are not your soul. Your soul is with the fiery God who flamed up to the roof of the heavens.</p>
<p>Should you still be sensitive? I notice that you are forging secret plans for revenge, plotting deceitful tricks. But you are an idiot, you cannot take revenge on fate. Childish one, you probably even want to lash the sea. Build better bridges instead; that is a better way to squander your wit.</p>
<p>You want to be understood? That’s all we needed! Understand yourself, and you will be sufficiently understood. You will have quite enough work in hand with that. Mothers’ little dears want to be understood. Understand yourself, that is the best protection against sensitivity and satisfies your childish longing to be understood. I suppose you want to turn others into slaves of your desirousness again? But you know that I must live with you and that I will no longer tolerate such abject plaintiveness.8</p>
<p>{2} After I had spoken these and many more angry words to my I, I noticed that I began to bear being alone with myself. But the touchiness still stirred in me frequently and I had to lash myself just as often. And I did this until even the pleasure in self-torment faded.9</p>
<p>10Then I heard a voice one night; it came from afar and was the voice of my soul. She spoke: “How distant you are!”</p>
<p>I: “Is that you my soul, from which height and distance do you speak?”</p>
<p>S: “I am above you. I am a world apart. I have become sunlike. I received the seeds of fire. Where are you? I can hardly find you in your mists.”</p>
<p>I: “I am down on the murky earth, in the dark smoke that the fire left us, and my gaze does not reach you. But your voice sounds closer.”</p>
<p>S: “I feel it. The heaviness of the earth penetrates me, damp cold enshrouds me, gloomy memories of former pain overcome me.”</p>
<p>I: “Do not lower yourself into the smoke and the darkness of the earth. I would like that which I am still working on to remain sunlike. Otherwise I will lose the courage to live further down in the darkness of the earth. Let me just hear your voice. I will never want to see you in the flesh again. Say something! Take it from the depths, from which fear perhaps flows to me.”</p>
<p>S: “I cannot, since your creative source flows from there.”</p>
<p>I: “You see my uncertainty.”</p>
<p>S: “The uncertain way is the good way. Upon it lie possibilities. Be unwavering and create.”</p>
<p>I heard the rushing of wings. I knew that the bird rose higher, above the clouds in the fiery brilliance of the outspread Godhead.</p>
<p>11I turned to my brother, the I; he stood sadly and looked at the ground and sighed, and would rather have been dead, since the burden of enormous suffering burdened him. But a voice spoke from me and said:</p>
<p>“It is hard—the sacrificed fall left and right—and you will be crucified for the sake of life.”</p>
<p>And I said to my I: “My brother, how do you like this speech?”</p>
<p>But he sighed deeply and moaned: “It is bitter, and I suffer much.”</p>
<p>To which I answered: “I know, but it is not to be altered.” But I did not know what that was, since I still did not know what the future held (this happened on the 21st May of the year 1914). In the excess of suffering I looked up to the clouds and called out to my soul and asked her. And I heard her voice, happy and bright, and she answered:</p>
<p>“Much happiness has happened to me. I rise higher, my wings grow.”</p>
<p>I was seized with bitterness at these words and I cried: “You live from the blood of the human heart.”</p>
<p>I heard her laughing—or was she not laughing? “No drink is dearer to me than red blood.”</p>
<p>Powerless anger seized me and I called out: “If you were not my soul who followed the God to the eternal realm, I would call you the most terrible scourge of men. But who moves you? I know that divinity is not humanity. The divine consumes the human. I know that this is the severity, this is the cruelty; he who has felt you with his hands can never remove the blood from his hands. I have become enslaved to you.”</p>
<p>She answered: “Do not be angry, do not complain. Let the bloody victims fall at your side. It is not your severity, it is not your cruelty, but necessity. The way of life is sown with fallen ones.”</p>
<p>I: “Yes, I see, it is a battlefield. My brother, what is with you? Are you groaning?”</p>
<p>Then my I answered: “Why should I not groan and moan? I load myself with the dead and cannot haul their number.”</p>
<p>But I did not understand my I and therefore spoke to him: “You are a pagan, my friend! Have you not heard that it is said, let the dead bury their dead?12 Why do you want to be burdened with the dead? You do not help them by hauling them.”</p>
<p>Then my I wailed: “But I pity the poor fallen ones, they cannot reach the light. Perhaps if I haul them—?”</p>
<p>I: “What is this? Their souls have accomplished as much as they could. Then they encountered fate. It will also happen to us. Your compassion is sick.”</p>
<p>But my soul called from afar: “Leave him compassion, compassion binds life and death.”</p>
<p>These words of my soul stung me. She spoke of compassion, she, who rose up following the God without compassion, and I asked her:</p>
<p>13“Why did you do that?”</p>
<p>For my human sensitivity could not grasp the hideousness of that hour. She answered:</p>
<p>“It is not meant for me to be in your world. I besmirch myself on the excrement of your earth.”</p>
<p>I: “Am I not earth? Am I not excrement? Did I commit an error that forced you to follow the God into the upper realms?”</p>
<p>S: “No, it was inner necessity. I belong to the Above.”</p>
<p>I: “Has no one suffered an irreplaceable loss through your disappearance?”</p>
<p>S: “On the contrary, you have enjoyed utmost benefit.”</p>
<p>I: “If I heed my human feeling about this, doubt could come over me.”</p>
<p>S: “What have you noticed? Why should what you see always be untrue? It is your particular wrong that you cannot stop making a fool of yourself. Can you not remain on your way for once?”</p>
<p>I: “You know that I doubt, because of my love for men.”</p>
<p>S: “No, for the sake of your weakness, for the sake of your doubt and disbelief. Stay on your way and do not run away from yourself. There is a divine and a human intention. They cross each other in stupid and godforsaken people, to whom you also belong from time to time.”</p>
<p>Since what my soul spoke about referred to nothing that I could see, nor could I see what my I suffered from (since this happened two months before the outbreak of the war), I wanted to understand it all as personal experiences within me, and consequently I could neither understand nor believe it all, since my belief is weak. And I believe that it is better in our time if belief is weak. We have outgrown that childhood where mere belief was the most suitable means to bring men to what is good and reasonable. Therefore if we wanted to have a strong belief again today, we would thus return to that earlier childhood. But we have so much knowledge and such a thirst for knowledge in us that we need knowledge more than belief. But the strength of belief would hinder us from attaining knowledge. Belief certainly may be something strong, but it is empty, and too little of the whole man can be involved, if our life with God is grounded only on belief. Should we simply believe first and foremost? That seems too cheap to me. Men who have understanding should not just believe, but should wrestle for knowledge to the best of their ability. Belief is not everything, but neither is knowledge. Belief does not give us the security and the wealth of knowing. Desiring knowledge sometimes takes away too much belief. Both must strike a balance.</p>
<p>But it is also dangerous to believe too much, because today everyone has to find his own way and encounters in himself a beyond full of strange and mighty things. He could easily take everything literally with too much belief and would be nothing but a lunatic. The childishness of belief breaks down in the face of our present necessities. We need differentiating knowledge to clear up the confusion which the discovery of the soul has brought in. Therefore it is perhaps much better to await better knowledge before one accepts things all too believingly.14</p>
<p>From these considerations I spoke to my soul:</p>
<p>“Is all that to be accepted? You know in what sense I ask this. It is not stupid and unbelieving to ask thus, but is doubting of a higher type.”</p>
<p>To this she answered: “I understand you—but it is to be accepted.”</p>
<p>To which I replied: “The solitude of this acceptance terrifies me. I dread the madness that befalls the solitary.”</p>
<p>She answered: “As you already know, I have long predicted solitude for you. You need not be afraid of madness. What I predict is valid.”</p>
<p>These words filled me with disquiet, since I felt that I could almost not accept what my soul predicted, because I did not understand it. I always wanted to understand it with regard to myself. Therefore I said to my soul: “What misunderstood fear torments me?”</p>
<p>“That is your disbelief, your doubt. You do not want to believe in the size of the sacrifice that is required. But it will go on to the bitter end. Greatness requires greatness. You still want to be too cheap. Did I not speak to you of abandonment, of leaving be? Do you want to have it better than other men?”</p>
<p>“No,” I replied. “No, that is not it. But I fear committing an injustice to men if I go my own way.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to avoid?” she said; “there is no avoidance. You must go your way, unconcerned about others, no matter whether they are good or bad. You have laid your hand on the divine, which those have not.”</p>
<p>I could not accept these words since I feared deception. Therefore I also did not want to accept this way that forced me into dialogue with my soul. I preferred to speak with men. But I felt compelled toward solitude and I feared at the same time the solitude of my thinking which departed from accustomed paths.15 As I pondered this, my soul spoke to me: “Did I not predict dark solitude for you?”</p>
<p>“I know,” I answered, “but I did not really think that it would happen. Must it be so?”</p>
<p>“You can only say yes. There is nothing to do other than for you to take care of your cause. If anything should happen, it can only happen on this way.”</p>
<p>“So it is hopeless,” I cried, “to resist solitude?”</p>
<p>“It is utterly hopeless. You should be forced into your work.”</p>
<p>As my soul spoke thus, an old man with a white beard and a haggard face approached me.16 I asked him what he wanted with me. To which he replied:</p>
<p>“I am a nameless one, one of the many who lived and died in solitude. The spirit of the times and the acknowledged truth required this from us. Look at me—you must learn this. Things have been too good for you.”17</p>
<p>“But,” I replied, “is this another necessity in our so very different time?”</p>
<p>“It is as true today as it was yesterday. Never forget that you are a man and therefore you must bleed for the goal of humanity. Practice solitude assiduously without grumbling so that everything will in time become ready. You should become serious, and hence take your leave from science. There is too much childishness in it. Your way goes toward the depths. Science is too superficial, mere language, mere tools. But you must set to work.”18 I did not know what work was mine, since everything was dark. And everything became heavy and doubtful and an endless sadness seized me and lasted for many days. Then, one night, I heard the voice of an old man. He spoke slowly, heavily, and his sentences appeared to be disconnected and terribly absurd, so that the fear of madness seized me again.19 For he spoke the following words:</p>
<p>20“It is not yet the evening of days. The worst comes last.</p>
<p>The hand that strikes first, strikes best.</p>
<p>Nonsense streams from the deepest wells, amply like the Nile.</p>
<p>Morning is more beautiful than night.</p>
<p>Flowers smell until they fade.</p>
<p>Ripeness comes as late as possible in spring, or else it misses its purpose.”</p>
<p>These sentences that the old man spoke to me on the night of the 25 May of the year 1914 appeared to me dreadfully meaningless. I felt my I squirm in pain. It moaned and wailed about the burden of the dead that rested on it. It seemed as if it had to carry a thousand dead.</p>
<p>This sadness did not leave until the 24th June 1914.21 In the night my soul spoke to me: “The greatest comes to the smallest.” After this nothing further was said. And then the war broke out. This opened my eyes about what I had experienced before, and it also gave me the courage to say all of that which I have written in the earlier part of this book.</p>
<p>{3} From there on the voices of the depths remained silent for a whole year. Again in summer, when I was out on the water alone, I saw an osprey plunge down not far from me; he seized a large fish and rose up into the skies again clutching it.22 I heard the voice of my soul, and she spoke: “That is a sign that what is below is borne upward.”</p>
<p>Soon after this on an autumn night I heard the voice of an old man (and this time I knew that it was ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ).23 He said:24 “I want to turn you around. I want to master you. I want to emboss you like a coin. I want to do business with you. One should buy and sell you.25 You should pass from hand to hand. Self-willing is not for you. You are the will of the whole. Gold is no master out of its own will and yet it rules the whole, despised and greedily demanded, an inexorable ruler: it lies and waits. He who sees it longs for it. It does not follow one around, but lies silently, with a brightly gleaming countenance, self-sufficient, a king that needs no proof of its power. Everyone seeks after it, few find it, but even the smallest piece is highly esteemed. It neither gives nor squanders itself. Everyone takes it where he finds it, and anxiously ensures that he doesn’t lose the smallest part of it. Everyone denies that he depends on it, and yet he secretly stretches out his hand longingly toward it. Must gold prove its necessity? It is proven through the longing of men. Ask it: who takes me? He who takes it, has it. Gold does not stir. It sleeps and shines. Its brilliance confuses the senses. Without a word, it promises everything that men deem desirable. It ruins those to be ruined and helps those on the rise to ascend.26</p>
<p>“A blazing hoard is piled up, it awaits the taker. What tribulations do men not take upon themselves for the sake of gold? It waits and does not shorten their tribulations—the greater the tribulations, the greater the trouble, the more esteemed it is. It grows from underground, from the molten lava. It slowly exudes, hidden in veins and rocks. Man exerts all cunning to dig it out, to raise it.”</p>
<p>But I called out dismayed: “What ambiguous speech, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ!”</p>
<p>27But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ continued: “Not only to teach, but also to disavow, or why then did I teach? If I do not teach, I do not have to disavow. But if I have taught, I must disavow thereafter. For if I teach, I must give others what they should have taken. What he acquires is good, but the gift that was not acquired is bad. To waste oneself means: to want to suppress many. Deceitfulness surrounds the giver because his own enterprise is deceitful. He is forced to revoke his gift and to deny his virtue.</p>
<p>“The burden of silence is not greater than the burden of my self that I would like to load onto you. Therefore I speak and I teach. May the listener defend himself against my ruse, by means of which I burden him.</p>
<p>“The best truth is also such a skillful deception that I also entangle myself in it as long as I do not realize the worth of a successful ruse.”</p>
<p>And I was startled again and cried: “Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, men have deceived themselves about you, therefore you deceive them. But he who fathoms you, fathoms himself.”</p>
<p>28But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ fell silent and retired into the shimmering cloud of uncertainty. He left me to my thoughts. And it occurred to me that high barriers would still need to be erected between men, less to protect them against mutual burdens than against mutual virtues. It seemed to me as if the so-called Christian morality of our time made for mutual enchantment. How can anyone bear the burden of the other, if it is still the highest that one can expect from a man, that he at least bears his own burden.</p>
<p>But sin probably resides in enchantment. If I accept self-forgetting virtue, I make myself the selfish tyrant of the other, and I am thus also forced to surrender myself again in order to make another my master, which always leaves me with a bad impression and is not to the other’s advantage. Admittedly, this interplay underpins society, but the soul of the individual becomes damaged since man thus learns always to live from the other instead of from himself. It appears to me that, if one is capable, one should not surrender oneself, as that induces, indeed even forces, the other to do likewise. But what happens if everyone surrenders themselves? That would be folly.</p>
<p>Not that it would be a beautiful or a pleasant thing to live with one’s self, but it serves the redemption of the self. Incidentally, can one give oneself up? With this one becomes one’s own slave. That is the opposite of accepting oneself. If one becomes one’s own slave—and this happens to everyone who surrenders himself—one is lived by the self. One does not live one’s self; it lives itself.29</p>
<p>The self-forgetting virtue is an unnatural alienation from one’s own essence, which is thus deprived of development. It is a sin to deliberately alienate the other from his self by means of one’s own virtuousness, for example, through saddling oneself with his burden. This sin rebounds on us.30</p>
<p>It is submission enough, amply enough, if we subjugate ourselves to our self. The work of redemption is always first to be done on ourselves, if one dare utter such a great word. This work cannot be done without love for ourselves. Must it be done at all? Certainly not, if one can endure a given condition and does not feel in need of redemption. The tiresome feeling of needing redemption can finally become too much for one. Then one seeks to rid oneself of it and thus enters into the work of redemption.</p>
<p>It appears to me that we benefit in particular from removing every sense of beauty from the thought of redemption, and even need to do so, or else we will deceive ourselves again because we like the word and because a beautiful shimmer spreads out over the thing through the great word. But one can at least doubt whether the work of redemption is in itself a beautiful thing. The Romans did not find the hanged Jew exactly tasteful, and the gloomy excessive enthusiasm for catacombs around which cheap, barbaric symbols gathered probably lacked a pleasant shimmer in their eyes, given that their perverse curiosity for everything barbaric and subterranean had already been aroused.</p>
<p>I think it would be most correct and most decent to say that one blunders into the work of redemption unintentionally, so to speak, if one wants to avoid what appears to be the unbearable evil of an insurmountable feeling of needing redemption. This step into the work of redemption is neither beautiful nor pleasant nor does it divulge an inviting appearance. And the thing itself is so difficult and full of torment that one should count oneself as one of the sick and not as one of the overhealthy who seek to impart their abundance to others.</p>
<p>Consequently we should also not use the other for our own supposed redemption. The other is no stepping stone for our feet. It is far better that we remain with ourselves. The need for redemption rather expresses itself through an increased need for love with which we think we can make the other happy. But meanwhile we are brimming with longing and desire to alter our own condition. And we love others to this end. If we had already achieved our purpose, the other would leave us cold. But it is true that we also need the other for our own redemption. Perhaps he will lend us his help voluntarily, since we are in a state of sickness and helplessness. Our love for him is, and should not be, selfless. That would be a lie. For its goal is our own redemption. Selfless love is true only as long as the demand of the self can be pushed to one side. But someday comes the turn of the self. Who would want to lend himself to such a self for love? Certainly only one who does not yet know what excess of bitterness, injustice, and poison the self of a man harbors who has forgotten his self and made a virtue of it.</p>
<p>In terms of the self, selfless love is a veritable sin.</p>
<p>31We must presumably often go to ourselves to re-establish the connection with the self, since it is torn apart all too often, not only by our vices but also by our virtues. For vices as well as virtues always want to live outside. But through constant outer life we forget the self and through this we also become secretly selfish in our best endeavors.32 What we neglect in ourselves blends itself secretly into our actions toward others.</p>
<p>Through uniting with the self we reach the God.33</p>
<p>I must say this, not with reference to the opinions of the ancients or this or that authority, but because I have experienced it. It has happened thus in me. And it certainly happened in a way that I neither expected nor wished for. The experience of the God in this form was unexpected and unwanted. I wish I could say it was a deception and only too willingly would I disown this experience. But I cannot deny that it has seized me beyond all measure and steadily goes on working in me. So if it is a deception, then deception is my God. Moreover, the God is in the deception. And if this were already the greatest bitterness that could happen to me, I would have to confess to this experience and recognize the God in it. No insight or objection is so strong that it could surpass the strength of this experience. And even if the God had revealed himself in a meaningless abomination, I could only avow that I have experienced the God in it. I even know that it is not too difficult to cite a theory that would sufficiently explain my experience and join it to the already known. I could furnish this theory myself and be satisfied in intellectual terms, and yet this theory would be unable to remove even the smallest part of the knowledge that I have experienced the God. I recognize the God by the unshakeableness of the experience. I cannot help but recognize him by the experience. I do not want to believe it, I do not need to believe it, nor could I believe it. How can one believe such? My mind would need to be totally confused to believe such things. Given their nature, they are most improbable. Not only improbable but also impossible for our understanding. Only a sick brain could produce such deceptions. I am like those sick persons who have been overcome by delusion and sensory deception. But I must say that the God makes us sick. I experience the God in sickness. A living God afflicts our reason like a sickness. He fills the soul with intoxication. He fills us with reeling chaos. How many will the God break?</p>
<p>The God appears to us in a certain state of the soul. Therefore we reach the God through the self.34 35 Not the self is God, although we reach the God through the self. The God is behind the self, above the self, the self itself, when he appears. But he appears as our sickness, from which we must heal ourselves.36We must heal ourselves from the God, since he is also our heaviest wound.</p>
<p>For in the first instance the God’s power resides entirely in the self, since the self is completely in the God, because we were not with the self. We must draw the self to our side. Therefore we must wrestle with the God for the self. Since the God is an unfathomable powerful movement that sweeps away the self into the boundless, into dissolution.</p>
<p>Hence when the God appears to us we are at first powerless, captivated, divided, sick, poisoned with the strongest poison, but drunk with the highest health.</p>
<p>Yet we cannot remain in this state, since all the powers of our body are consumed like fat in the flames. Hence we must strive to free the self from the God, so that we can live.37</p>
<p>38It is certainly possible and even quite easy for our reason to deny the God and to speak only of sickness. Thus we accept the sick part and can also heal it. But it will be a healing with loss. We lose a part of life. We go on living, but as ones lamed by the God. Where the fire blazed dead ashes lie.</p>
<p>I believe that we have the choice: I preferred the living wonders of the God. I daily weigh up my whole life and I continue to regard the fiery brilliance of the God as a higher and fuller life than the ashes of rationality. The ashes are suicide to me. I could perhaps put out the fire but I cannot deny to myself the experience of the God. Nor can I cut myself off from this experience. I also do not want to, since I want to live. My life wants itself whole.</p>
<p>Therefore I must serve my self. I must win it in this way. But I must win it so that my life will become whole. For it seems to me to be sinful to deform life where there is yet the possibility to live it fully. The service of the self is therefore divine service and the service of mankind. If I carry myself I relieve mankind of myself and heal my self from the God.</p>
<p>I must free my self from the God,39 since the God I experienced is more than love; he is also hate, he is more than beauty, he is also the abomination, he is more than wisdom, he is also meaninglessness, he is more than power, he is also powerlessness, he is more than omnipresence, he is also my creature.</p>
<p>In the following night, I heard the voice of ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ again and he said:40</p>
<p>“Draw nearer, enter into the grave of the God. The place of your work should be in the vault. The God should not live in you, but you should live in the God.”</p>
<p>41These words disturbed me since I had thought before precisely to free myself from the God. But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ advised me to enter even deeper into the God.</p>
<p>Since the God has ascended to the upper realms, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ also has become different. He first appeared to me as a magician who lived in a distant land, but then I felt his nearness and, since the God has ascended, I knew that ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had intoxicated me and given me a language that was foreign to me and of a different sensitivity. All of this faded when the God arose and only ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ kept that language. But I felt that he went on other ways than I did. Probably the most part of what I have written in the earlier part of this book was given to me by ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ.42 Consequently I was as if intoxicated. But now I noticed that ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ assumed a form distinct from me.</p>
<p>{4}43Several weeks later, three shades approached me. I noticed from their chilly breath that they were dead. The first figure was that of a woman. She drew near and made a soft whirring sound, the whirring of the wings of the sun beetle. Then I recognized her. When she was still alive, she recovered the mysteries of the Egyptians for me, the red sun disk and the song of the golden wings. She remained shadowy and I could hardly understand her words. She said:</p>
<p>“It was night when I died—you still live in the day—there are still days, years ahead of you—what will you begin—Let me have the word—oh, that you cannot hear! How difficult—give me the word!”</p>
<p>I answered dismayed: “I do not know the word that you seek.”</p>
<p>But she cried: “The symbol, the mediator, we need the symbol, we hunger for it, make light for us.”</p>
<p>“Wherefrom? How can I? I do not know the symbol that you demand.”</p>
<p>But she insisted: “You can do it, reach for it.”</p>
<p>And precisely at this moment the sign was placed in my hand and I looked at it filled with boundless astonishment. Then she spoke loudly and joyfully to me:44</p>
<p>“That is it, that is HAP, the symbol that we desired, that we needed. It is terribly simple, initially stupid, naturally godlike, the God’s other pole. This is precisely the pole we needed.”</p>
<p>“Why do you need HAP?”45 I replied.</p>
<p>“He is in the light, the other God is in the night.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” I answered, “what’s that, beloved? The God of the spirit is in the night? Is that the son? The son of the frogs? Woe betide us, if he is the God of our day!”</p>
<p>But the dead one spoke full of triumph:</p>
<p>“He is the flesh spirit, the blood spirit, he is the extract of all bodily juices, the spirit of the sperm and the entrails, of the genitals, of the head, of the feet, of the hands, of the joints, of the bones, of the eyes and ears, of the nerves and the brain; he is the spirit of the sputum and of excretion.”</p>
<p>“Are you of the devil?” I exclaimed full of horror. “Where does my flashing godly light remain?”</p>
<p>But she said: “Your body remains with you, my beloved, your living body. The enlightening thought comes from the body.”</p>
<p>“What thought are you talking about? I recognize no such thought,” I said.</p>
<p>“It crawls around like a worm, like a serpent, soon there, soon here, a blind newt of Hell.”</p>
<p>“Then I must be buried alive. Oh horror! Oh rottenness! Must I attach myself completely, like a leech?”</p>
<p>“Yes, drink blood,” she said, “suck it up, get your fill from the carcass, there is juice inside, certainly disgusting, but nourishing. You should not understand, but suck!”</p>
<p>“Damned horror! No, three times no,” I cried in outrage.</p>
<p>But she said: “It should not irritate you, we need this meal, the life juices of men, since we want to share in your life. Thus we can draw closer to you. We want to give you tidings of what you need to know.”</p>
<p>“That is horribly absurd! What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>46But she looked at me as she had done on the day I had last seen her among the living, and on which she showed me, unaware of its meaning, something of the mystery of what the Egyptians had left behind. And she said to me:</p>
<p>“Do it for me, for us. Do you recall my legacy, the red sun disk, the golden wings and the wreath of life and duration? Immortality, of this there are things to know.”</p>
<p>“The way that leads to this knowledge is Hell.”</p>
<p>47From this I sank into gloomy brooding since I suspected the heaviness and incomprehension and the immeasurable solitude of this way. And after a long struggle with all the weakness and cowardice in me, I decided to take upon myself this solitude of the holy error and the eternally valid truth.48 And in the third night I called to my dead beloved and asked her:</p>
<p>“Teach me the knowledge of the worms and the crawling creatures, open to me the darkness of the spirits!”</p>
<p>She whispered: “Give blood, so that I may drink and gain speech. Were you lying when you said that you would leave the power to the son?”</p>
<p>“No, I was not lying. But I said something that I did not understand.”</p>
<p>“You are fortunate,” she said, “if you can say what you do not understand. So listen: HAP49 is not the foundation but the summit of the church that still lies sunken. We need this church since we can live in it with you and take part in your life. You have excluded us to your own detriment.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, is HAP for you the sign of the church in which you hope for community with the living? Speak, why do you hesitate?”</p>
<p>She moaned and whispered with a weak voice: “Give blood, I need blood.”50</p>
<p>“So take blood from my heart,” I spoke.</p>
<p>“I thank you,” she said, “that is fullness of life. The air of the shadow world is thin since we hover on the ocean of the air like birds above the sea. Many went beyond limits, fluttering on indeterminate paths of outer space, bumping at hazard into alien worlds. But we, we who are still near and incomplete, would like to immerse ourselves in the sea of the air and return to earth, to the living. Do you not have an animal form into which I can enter?”</p>
<p>“What,” I exclaimed horrified, “you would like to be my dog?”</p>
<p>“If possible, yes,” she replied, “I would even like to be your dog. To me you are of unspeakable worth, all my hope, that still clings to earth. I would still like to see completed what I left too soon. Give me blood, much blood!”</p>
<p>“So drink,” I said despairingly, “drink, so that what should be will be.”</p>
<p>She whispered with a hesitant voice: “Brimo51—I guess that’s what you call her—the old one—which is how it begins—the one who bore the son—the powerful HAP, who grew out of her shame and strove after the wife of Heaven, who arches over earth, for Brimo, above and below, envelops the son.52 She bears and raises him. Born from below, he fertilizes the Above, since the wife is his mother, and the mother is his wife.”</p>
<p>“Accursed teaching! Is this still not enough of the horrifying Mysterium?” I cried full of outrage and abhorrence.</p>
<p>“If Heaven becomes pregnant and can no longer hold its fruit, it gives birth to a man who carries the burden of sin—that is the tree of life and of unending duration. Give me your blood! Listen! This riddle is terrible: when Brimo, the heavenly, was pregnant, she gave birth to the dragon, first the afterbirth and then the son, HAP, and the one who carried HAP. HAP is the rebellion of the Below, but the bird comes from the Above and places itself on the head of HAP. That is peace. You are a vessel. Speak, Heaven, pour out your rain. You are a shell. Empty shells do not spill, they catch. May it stream in from all the winds. Let me tell you that another evening is approaching. A day, two days, many days have come to an end. The light of day goes down and illumines the shadow, itself a shadow of the sun. Life becomes a shadow, and the shadow enlivens itself, the shadow that is greater than you. Do you think that your shadow is your son? He is small at midday, and fills the sky at midnight.”53</p>
<p>But I was exhausted and desperate and could hear no more, and so I said to the dead one:</p>
<p>54“So you introduce the terrible son who lived beneath me, under the trees on the water? Is he the spirit that the heavens pour out, or is he the soulless worm that the earth bore? Oh Heaven—Oh most sinister womb! Do you want to suck the life out of me for the sake of the shadow? Should humanity thus completely go to waste for divinity?55 Should I live with shadows, instead of with the living? Should all the longing for the living belong to you, the dead? Did you not have your time to live? Did you not use it? Should a living person give his life for your sake, you who did not live the eternal? Speak, you mute shadows, who stand at my door and demand my blood!”</p>
<p>The shadow of the dead one raised its voice and said: “You see—or do you still not see, what the living do with your life. They fritter it away. But with me you live yourself, since I belong to you. I belong to your invisible following and community. Do you believe that the living see you? They see only your shadow, not you—you servant, you bearer, you vessel—”</p>
<p>“How you hold forth! Am I at your mercy? Should I no longer see the light of day? Should I become a shadow with a living body? You are formless and beyond grasp, and you emanate the coldness of the grave, a breath of emptiness. To let myself be buried alive—what are you thinking of? Too soon, it seems to me, I must die first. Do you have the honey that pleases my heart and the fire that warms my hands? What are you, you mournful shadows? You specters of children! What do you want with my blood? Truly, you are even worse than men. Men give little, yet what do you give? Do you make the living? The warm beauty? Or joy perhaps? Or should all this go to your gloomy Hell? What do you offer in return? Mysteries? Will the living live from these? I regard your mysteries as tricks if the living cannot live from them.”</p>
<p>But she interrupted me and cried: “Impetuous one, stop, you take my breath away. We are shadows; become a shadow and you will grasp what we give.”</p>
<p>“I do not want to die to descend into your darkness.”</p>
<p>“But,” she said, “you need not die. You must only let yourself be buried.”</p>
<p>“In the hope of resurrection? No joking now!”</p>
<p>But she spoke calmly: “You suspect what will happen. Triple walls before you and invisibility—to Hell with your longing and feeling! At least you do not love us, so we will cost you less dearly than the men who roll in your love and patience and have you make a fool of yourself.”</p>
<p>“My dead one, I think you are speaking my language.”</p>
<p>She replied to me scornfully: “Men love—and you! What an error! All this means is that you want to run away from yourself. What do you do to men? You tempt and coax them into megalomania, to which you fall victim.”</p>
<p>“But it grieves me, pains me, howls at me; I feel a great longing, everything soft complains, and my heart yearns.”</p>
<p>But she was unsparing. “Your heart belongs to us,” she said. “What do you want with men? Self-defense against men—so that you walk on your own two feet, not on human crutches. Men need the undemanding, but they are always wanting love to be able to run away from themselves. This ought to stop. Why do fools go out and preach the gospel to the negroes, and then ridicule it in their own country? Why do these hypocritical preachers speak of love, divine and human love, and use the same gospel to justify the right to wage war and commit murderous injustice? Above all, what do they teach others when they themselves stand up to their necks in the black mud of deception and self-deceit? Have they cleaned their own house, have they recognized and driven out their own devil? Because they do none of this, they preach love to be able to run away from themselves, and to do to others what they should do to themselves. But this greatly prized love, given to one’s own self, burns like fire. These hypocrites and liars have noticed this—as you have—and prefer to love others. Is that love? It is false hypocrisy.56 It always begins in yourself and in all things and above all with love. Do you believe that one who wounds himself unsparingly does the other a good deed with his love? No, of course you don’t believe it. You even know that he only teaches the other how one must wound oneself, so that he can compel others to express sympathy. Therefore you should be a shadow since this is what men need. How can they get away from the hypocrisy and foolishness of your love if you yourself cannot? For everything begins with yourself. But your horse still cannot refrain from whinnying. Even worse, your virtue is a wagging dog, a growling dog, a licking dog, a barking dog—and you call that human love! But love is: to bear and endure oneself. It begins with this. It is truly about you; you are not yet tempered; other fires must yet come over you until you have accepted your solitude and learned to love.</p>
<p>“What do you ask about love? What is love? To live, above all, that is more than love. Is war love? You are bound to see what human love is still good enough for—a means like other means. Therefore, above all, solitude, until every softness toward yourself has been burnt out of you. You should learn to freeze.”57</p>
<p>“I see only graves before me,” I answered, “what cursed will is above me?”</p>
<p>“The will of the God, that is stronger than you, you slave, you vessel. You have fallen into the hands of the greater. He knows no pity. Your Christian shrouds have fallen, the veils that blinded your eyes. The God has become strong again. The yoke of men is lighter than the yoke of the God; therefore everyone seeks to yoke the other out of mercy. But he who does not fall into the hands of men falls into those of the God. May he be well and may woe betide him! There is no escape.”</p>
<p>“Is that freedom?” I cried.</p>
<p>“The highest freedom. Only the God above you, through yourself. Comfort yourself with this and that as well as you can. The God bolts doors that you cannot open. Let your feelings whimper like puppies. The ears on high are deaf.”</p>
<p>“But,” I answered, “is there no outrage for the sake of the human?”</p>
<p>“Outrage? I laugh at your outrage. The God knows only power and creation. He commands and you act. Your anxieties are laughable. There is only one road, the military road of the Godhead.”</p>
<p>The dead one spoke these unsparing words to me.58 As I did not want to obey anyone, I had to obey this voice. And she spoke unsparing words about the power of the God. I had to accept these words.59 We have to greet a new light, a blood-red sun, a painful wonder. No one forces me to; only the foreign will in me commands and I cannot escape since I find no grounds to do so.</p>
<p>The sun, appearing to me, swam in a sea of blood and wailing; therefore I said to the dead one:</p>
<p>“Should it be the sacrifice of joy?”</p>
<p>But the dead one replied: “The sacrifice of all joy, provided that you do it yourself. Joy should neither be made nor sought; it should come, if it must come. I demand your service. You should not serve your personal devil. That leads to superfluous pain. True joy is simple: it comes and exists from itself, and is not to be sought here and there. At the risk of encountering black night, you must devote yourself to me and seek no joy. Joy can never ever be prepared, but exists of its own accord or exists not at all. All you must do is fulfill your task, nothing else. Joy comes from fulfillment, but not from longing. I have the power. I command, you obey.”</p>
<p>“I fear that you will destroy me.”</p>
<p>But she answered: “I am life that destroys only the unfit. Therefore take care that you are no unapt tool. You want to rule yourself? You steer your ship onto the sand. Build your bridge, stone upon stone, but don’t think of wanting to take the helm. You go astray if you want to escape my service. There is no salvation without me. Why are you dreaming and hesitating?”</p>
<p>“You see,” I answered, “that I am blind and do not know where to begin.”</p>
<p>“It always begins with the neighbor. Where is the church? Where is the community?”</p>
<p>“This is pure madness,” I cried out indignantly, “why do you speak of a church? Am I a prophet? How can I claim such for myself? I am just a man who is not entitled to know any better than others.”</p>
<p>But she replied: “I want the church, it is necessary for you and for others. Otherwise what are you going to do with those whom I force to your feet? The beautiful and natural will nestle into the terrible and dark and will show the way. The church is something natural. The holy ceremony must be dissolved and become spirit. The bridge should lead out beyond humanity,60 inviolable, far, of the air. There is a community of spirits founded on outer signs with a solid meaning.”</p>
<p>“Cease,” I cried, “that doesn’t bear thinking about, it’s incomprehensible.”</p>
<p>But she continued: “Community with the dead is what both you and the dead need. Do not commingle with any of the dead, but stand apart from them and give to each his due. The dead demand your expiatory prayers.”</p>
<p>And when she spoke these words, she raised her voice and evoked the dead in my name:</p>
<p>“You dead, I call you.</p>
<p>“You shades of the departed, who have cast off the torment of living, come here!</p>
<p>“My blood, the juice of my life, will be your meal and your drink.</p>
<p>“Sustain yourself from me, so that life and speech will be yours.</p>
<p>“Come, you dark and restless ones, I will refresh you with my blood, the blood of a living one so that you will gain speech and life, in me and through me.</p>
<p>“The God forces me to address this prayer to you so that you come to life. Too long have we left you alone.</p>
<p>“Let us build the bond of community so that the living and the dead image will become one and the past will live on in the present.</p>
<p>“Our desire pulls us to the living world and we are lost in our desire.</p>
<p>“Come drink the living blood, drink your fill so that we will be saved from the inextinguishable and unrelenting power of vivid longing for visible, graspable, and present being.</p>
<p>“Drink from our blood the desire that begets evil, as quarrel, discord, ugliness, violent deed, and famishment.</p>
<p>“Take, eat, this is my body, that lives for you. Take, eat, drink, this is my blood, whose desire flows for you.</p>
<p>“Come, celebrate a Last Supper with me for your redemption and mine.</p>
<p>“I need community with you so that I fall prey neither to the community of the living nor to my desire and yours, whose envy is insatiable and therefore begets evil.</p>
<p>“Help me, so that I do not forget that my desire is a sacrificial fire for you.</p>
<p>“You are my community. I live what I can live for the living. But the excess of my longing belongs to you, you shades. We need to live with you.</p>
<p>“Be auspicious to us and open our closed spirit so that we become blessed with the redeeming light. May it happen thus!”</p>
<p>When the dead one had ended this prayer, she turned to me again and said:</p>
<p>“Great is the need of the dead. But the God needs no sacrificial prayer. He has neither goodwill nor ill will. He is kind and fearful, though not actually so, but only seems to you thus. But the dead hear your prayers since they are still of human nature and not free of goodwill and ill will. Do you not understand? The history of humanity is older and wiser than you. Was there a time when there were no dead? Vain deception! Only recently have men begun to forget the dead and to think that they have now begun the real life, sending them into a frenzy.”</p>
<p>{5} When the dead one had uttered all these words, she disappeared. I sank into gloominess and dull confusion. When I looked up again, I saw my soul in the upper realms, hovering irradiated by the distant brilliance that streamed from the Godhead.61 And I called out:</p>
<p>“You know what has taken place. You see that it surpasses the power and understanding of a man. But I accept it for your sake and mine. To be crucified on the tree of life, Oh bitterness! Oh painful silence! If it weren’t you, my soul, who touched the fiery Heaven and the eternal fullness, how could I?</p>
<p>“I cast myself before human animals—Oh most unmanly torment! I must let my virtues, my best ability be torn apart, because they are still thorns in the side of the human animal. Not death for the sake of the best, but befouling and rending of the most beautiful for the sake of life.</p>
<p>“Alas, is there nowhere a salutary deception to protect me from having the Last Supper with my carcass? The dead want to live from me.</p>
<p>“Why did you see me as the one to drink the cess of humanity that poured out of Christendom? Haven’t you had enough of beholding the fiery fullness, my soul? Do you still want to fly entire into the glaring white light of the Godhead? Into what shades of horror are you plunging me? Is the devil’s pool so deep that its mud sullies even your glowing robe?</p>
<p>“Where do you get the right to do me such a foul deed? Let the beaker of disgusting filth pass from me.62 But if this be not your will, then climb past fiery Heaven and lodge your charges and topple the throne of God, the dreadful, proclaim the right of men also before the Gods and take revenge on them for the infamous deed of humanity, since only Gods are able to spur on the human worm63 to acts of colossal atrocity. Let my fate suffice and let men manage human destiny.</p>
<p>“Oh my mother humanity, thrust the terrible worm of God, the strangler of men, from you. Do not venerate him for the sake of his terrible poison—a drop suffices—and what is a drop to him—who at the same time is all emptiness and all fullness?”</p>
<p>As I proclaimed these words, I noticed that ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ stood behind me and had given them to me. He came alongside me invisibly, and I felt the presence of the good and the beautiful. And he spoke to me with a soft deep voice:</p>
<p>64“Remove, Oh man, the divine, too, from your soul, as far as you can manage. What a devilish farce she carries on with you, as long as she still arrogates divine power over you! She’s an unruly child and a bloodthirsty daimon at the same time, a tormentor of humans without equal, precisely because she has divinity. Why? Where from? Because you venerate her. The dead too want the same thing. Why don’t they stay quiet? Because they have not crossed over to the other side. Why do they want sacrifice? So they can live. But why do they still want to live with men? Because they want to rule. They have not come to an end with their craving for power, since they died still lusting for power. A child, an old man, an evil woman, a spirit of the dead, and a devil are beings who need to be humored. Fear the soul, despise her, love her, just like the Gods. May they be far from us! But above all never lose them! Because when lost they are as malicious as the serpent, as bloodthirsty as the tiger that pounces on the unsuspecting from behind. A man who goes astray becomes an animal, a lost soul becomes a devil. Cling to the soul with love, fear, contempt, and hate, and don’t let her out of your sight. She is a hellish-divine treasure to be kept behind walls of iron and in the deepest vault. She always wants to get out and scatter glittering beauty. Beware, because you have already been betrayed! You’ll never find a more disloyal, more cunning and heinous woman than your soul. How should I praise the miracle of her beauty and perfection? Does she not stand in the brilliance of immortal youth? Is her love not intoxicating wine and her wisdom the primordial cleverness of serpents?</p>
<p>“Shield men from her, and her from men. Listen to what she wails and sings in prison but don’t let her escape, as she will immediately turn whore. As her husband you are blessed through her, and therefore cursed. She belongs to the daimonic race of the Tom Thumbs and giants, and is only distantly related to humankind. If you seek to grasp her in human terms you will be beside yourself. The excess of your rage, your doubt, and your love belong to her, but only the excess. If you give her this excess, humanity will be saved from the nightmare. For if you do not see your soul, you see her in fellow men and this will drive you mad, since this devilish mystery and hellish spook can hardly be seen through.</p>
<p>“Look at man, the weak one in his wretchedness and torment, whom the Gods have singled out as their quarry—tear to pieces the bloody veil that the lost soul has woven around man, the cruel nets woven by the death-bringing, and take hold of the divine whore who still cannot recover from her fall from grace and craves filth and power in raving blindness. Lock her up like a lecherous bitch who would like to mingle her blood with every dirty cur. Capture her, may enough at last be enough. Let her for once taste your torment so that she will get to feel man and his hammer, which he has wrested from the Gods.65</p>
<p>“May man rule in the human world. May his laws be valid. But treat the souls, daimons, and Gods in their way, offering what is demanded. But burden no man, demand and expect nothing from him, with what your devil-souls and God-souls lead you to believe, but endure and remain silent and do piously what befits your kind. You should act not on the other but on yourself, unless the other asks for your help or opinion. Do you understand what the other does? Never—how should you? Does the other understand what you do? Whence do you take the right to think about the other and act on him? You have neglected yourself, your garden is full of weeds, and you want to teach your neighbor about order and provide evidence for his shortcomings.</p>
<p>“Why should you keep silent about the others? Because there would be plenty to discuss concerning your own daimons. But if you act on and think about the other without him soliciting your opinion or advice, you do so because you cannot distinguish yourself from your soul. Therefore you fall victim to her presumption and help her into whoring. Or do you believe that you must lend your human power to the soul or the Gods, or even that it will be useful and pious work if you want to bring the Gods to bear on others? Blinded one, that is Christian presumptuousness. The Gods don’t need your help, you laughable idolater, who seem to yourself like a God and want to form, improve, rebuke, educate, and create men. Are you perfect yourself?—therefore remain silent, mind your business, and behold your inadequacy every day. You are most in need of your own help; you should keep your opinions and good advice ready for yourself and not run to others like a whore with understanding and the desire to help. You don’t need to play God. What are daimons, who don’t act out of themselves? So let them go to work, but not through you, or else you yourself will become a daimon to others; leave them to themselves and don’t pre-empt them with awkward love, concern, care, advice, and other presumptions. Otherwise you would be doing the work of the daimons; you yourself would become a daimon and therefore go into a frenzy. But the daimons are pleased at the raving of helpless men advising and striving to help others. So stay quiet, fulfill the cursed work of redemption on yourself, for then the daimons must torment themselves and in the same way all your fellow men, who do not distinguish themselves from their souls and let themselves be mocked by daimons. Is it cruel to leave your blinded fellow human beings to their own devices? It would be cruel if you could open their eyes. But you could open their eyes only if they solicited your opinion and help. Yet if they do not, they do not need your help. If you force your help on them nonetheless, you become their daimon and increase their blindness, since you set a bad example. Draw the coat of patience and silence over your head, sit down, and leave the daimon to accomplish his work. If he brings something about, he will work wonders. Thus will you sit under fruit-bearing trees.</p>
<p>“Know that the daimons would like to inflame you to embrace their work, which is not yours. And, you fool, you believe that it is you and that it is your work. Why? Because you can’t distinguish yourself from your soul. But you are distinct from her, and you should not pursue whoring with other souls as if you yourself were a soul, but instead you are a powerless man who needs all his force for his own completion. Why do you look to the other? What you see in him lies neglected in yourself. You should be the guard before the prison of your soul. You are your soul’s eunuch, who protects her from Gods and men, or protects the Gods and men from her. Power is given to the weak man, a poison that paralyzes even the Gods, like a poison sting bestowed upon the little bee whose force is far inferior to yours. Your soul could seize this poison and thereby endanger even the Gods. So put the soul under wraps, distinguish yourself from her, since not only your fellow men but also the Gods must live.”</p>
<p>When ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had finished, I turned to my soul, who had come nearer from above during ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ’s speech, and spoke to her:</p>
<p>“Have you heard what ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ has been saying? How does this tone strike you? Is his advice good?”</p>
<p>But she said, “Do not mock, or else you strike yourself. Do not forget to love me.”</p>
<p>“It is difficult for me to unite hate and love,” I replied.</p>
<p>“I understand,” she said, “yet you know that it is the same. Hate and love mean the same to me. Like all women of my kind, form matters less to me than that everything belong to me or else to no one. I am also jealous of the hate you give others. I want everything, since I need everything for the great journey that I intend to begin after your disappearance. I must prepare in good time. Until then I must make timely provision and much is still lacking.”</p>
<p>“And do you agree that I throw you into prison” I asked.</p>
<p>“Of course,” she answered, “there I have peace and can collect myself. Your human world makes me drunk—so much human blood—I could get intoxicated on it to the point of madness. Doors of iron, walls of stone, cold darkness and the rations of penance—that is the bliss of redemption. You do not suspect my torment when the bloody intoxication seizes me, hurls me again and again into living matter from a dark fearful creative urge that formerly brought me close to the lifeless and ignited the terrible lust for procreation in me. Remove me from conceiving matter, the rutting feminine of yawning emptiness. Force me into confinement where I can find resistance and my own law. Where I can think about the journey, the rising sun the dead one spoke of, and the buzzing, melodious golden wings. Be thankful—don’t you want to thank me? You are blinded. You deserve my highest thanks.”</p>
<p>Filled with delight at these words, I cried:</p>
<p>“How divinely beautiful you are!” And at the same time fury seized me:</p>
<p>66“Oh bitterness! You have dragged me through sheer and utter Hell, you have tormented me nearly to death—and I long for your thanks. Yes, I am moved that you thank me. The hound’s nature lies in my blood. Therefore I am bitter—for my sake, since how does it move you! You are divine and devilishly great, wherever and howsoever you are. As yet I am only your eunuch doorkeeper, no less imprisoned than you. Speak, you concubine of Heaven, you divine monster! Have I not fished you from the swamp? How do you like the black hole? Speak without blood, sing from your own force, you have gorged yourself on men.”</p>
<p>Then my soul writhed and like a downtrodden worm turned and cried out, “Pity, have compassion.”</p>
<p>“Compassion? Have you ever had compassion for me? You brute bestial tormentor! You’ve never gotten past compassionate moods. You lived on human food and drank my blood. Has it made you fat? Will you learn to revere the torment of the human animal? What would you souls and Gods want without man? Why do you long for him? Speak, whore!”</p>
<p>She sobbed, “My speech stops. I’m horrified at your accusation.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to get serious? Are you going to have second thoughts? Are you going to learn modesty or perhaps even some other human virtue, you soulless soul-being? Yes, you have no soul, because you are the thing itself, you fiend. Would you like a human soul? Should I perhaps become your earthly soul so that you will have a soul? You see, I’ve gone to your school. I’ve learned how one behaves as a soul, perfectly ambiguous, mysteriously untruthful and hypocritical.”</p>
<p>While I spoke to my soul in this way, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ stood silently a little distance off. But now he stepped forward, laid his hand on my shoulder, and spoke in my name:</p>
<p>“You are blessed, virgin soul, praised be your name. You are the chosen one among women. You are the God-bearer. Praise be to you! Honor and fame be yours in eternity.</p>
<p>“You live in the golden temple. The peoples come from afar and praise you.</p>
<p>“We, your vassals, wait on your words.</p>
<p>“We drink red wine, dispensing a sacrificial drink in recollection of the meal of blood that you celebrated with us.</p>
<p>“We prepare a black chicken for a sacrificial meal in remembrance of the man who fed you.</p>
<p>“We invite our friends to the sacrificial meal, carrying wreaths of ivy and roses in remembrance of the farewell you took from your saddened vassals and maids.</p>
<p>“Let this day be a festival celebrating joy and life—the day upon which you, blessed one, commence the return journey from the land of men where you have learned how to be a soul.</p>
<p>“You follow the son who ascended and passed over.</p>
<p>“You carry us up as your soul and set yourself before the son of God, maintaining your immortal right as an ensouled being.</p>
<p>“We are joyful, good things will follow you. We lend you strength. We are in the land of men and we are alive.”</p>
<p>After ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had ended, my soul looked saddened and pleased, and hesitated and yet hurried to prepare herself to leave us and to ascend again, happy at the regained freedom. But I suspected something secret in her, something that she sought to hide from me. Therefore I did not let her make off, but spoke to her:67</p>
<p>“What holds you back? What are you hiding? Probably a golden vessel, a jewel that you have stolen from men? Isn’t that a gem, a piece of gold, shining through your robe? What is the beautiful thing that you robbed when you drank the blood of men and ate their sacred flesh? Speak the truth, for I see the lie on your face.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t taken anything,” she answered annoyed.</p>
<p>“You are lying, you want to cast suspicion on me, where you are lacking. Those times when you could rob men unpunished are over. Surrender everything that is his sacred inheritance and that you have rapaciously claimed. You have stolen from the vassal and the beggar. God is rich and powerful, you can steal from him. His kingdom knows no loss. Shameful liar, when will you finally stop plaguing and robbing your humanity?”</p>
<p>But she looked at me as innocently as a dove and said gently:</p>
<p>“I do not suspect you. I wish you well. I respect your right. I acknowledge your humanity. I do not take anything away from you. I do not withhold anything from you. You possess everything, I, nothing.”</p>
<p>“Yet,” I exclaimed, “you lie insufferably. You possess not only that marvelous thing that belongs to me, but you also have access to the Gods and eternal fullness. Therefore surrender what you have stolen, liar.”</p>
<p>Now she was vexed and replied:</p>
<p>“How can you? I no longer recognize you. You are crazy, even more: you are laughable, a childish ape, who extends his paw toward everything that glitters. But I will not allow what is mine to be taken from me.”</p>
<p>Then I cried enraged, “You’re lying, you’re lying; I saw the gold, I saw the sparkling light of the jewel; I know it belongs to me. You ought not take that away from me. Give it back!”</p>
<p>Then she broke out in defiant tears and said, “I don’t want to part with it, it’s too precious to me. Do you want to rob me of the last ornament?”</p>
<p>“Embellish yourself with the gold of the Gods, but not with the meager treasures of earthbound human beings. May you taste heavenly poverty after you have preached earthly poverty and necessity to your humankind, like a true and proper cleric full of lies, who fills his belly and purse and preaches poverty.”</p>
<p>“You torment me awfully,” she wailed, “leave me just this one thing. You men still have enough. I cannot be without this very one, this incomparable one, for whose sake even the Gods envy men.”</p>
<p>“I will not be unjust,” I replied, “But give me what belongs to me and beg for what you need from it. What is it? Speak!”</p>
<p>“Alas, that I can neither keep it nor conceal it! It is love, warm human love, blood, warm red blood, the holy source of life, the unification of everything separated and longed for.”</p>
<p>“So,” I said, “it is love that you claim as a natural right and property, although you still ought to beg for it. You get drunk on the blood of man and let him starve. Love belongs to me. I want to love, not you through me. You’ll crawl and beg for it like a dog. You’ll raise your hands and fawn like hungry hounds. I possess the key. I will be a more just administrator than you godless Gods. You will gather around the source of blood, the sweet miracle, and you will come bearing gifts so that you may receive what you need. I protect the holy source so that no God can seize it for himself. The Gods know no measure and no mercy. They get drunk on the most precious of draughts. Ambrosia and nectar68 are the flesh and blood of men, truly a noble meal. They waste the drink in drunkenness, the goods of the poor, since they have neither God nor soul presiding over them as their judges. Presumptuousness and excessiveness, severity and callousness are your essence. Greed for the sake of greed, power for the sake of power, pleasure for the sake of pleasure, immoderation and insatiableness: this is how one recognizes you, you daimons.</p>
<p>“Yes, you have yet to learn, you devils and Gods, you daimons and souls, to crawl in the dust for the sake of love so that from someone somewhere you snatch a drop of the living sweetness. Learn humility and pride from men for the sake of love.</p>
<p>“You Gods, your first born son is man. He bore a terribly beautiful-ugly son of God who is renewal to you all. But this mystery, too, fulfills you: you bore a son of men who is my renewal, no less splendid-terrible, and his rule also will serve you.”</p>
<p>Then ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ approached me, raised his hand, and spoke:69</p>
<p>“Both God and man are disappointed victims of deception, blessedly blessed, powerlessly powerful. The eternally rich universe unfolds again in the earthly Heaven and the Heaven of the Gods, in the underworlds and in the worlds above. Separation once more comes to the agonizingly united and yoked. Endless multiplicity takes the place of what has been forced together, since only diversity is wealth, blood, and harvest.”</p>
<p>A night and a day passed, and when night came again and I looked around I saw that my soul hesitated and waited. So I addressed her:70</p>
<p>“What, you’re still here? Didn’t you find the way or didn’t you find the words, which belong to me? How do you honor humankind, your earthly soul? Recall what I bore and suffered for you, how I wasted myself, how I lay before you and writhed, how I gave my blood to you! I have an obligation to lay on you: learn to honor humankind, for I saw the land that is promised to man, the land where milk and honey flows.71</p>
<p>“I saw the land of the promised love.</p>
<p>“I saw the splendor of the sun on that land.</p>
<p>“I saw the green forests, the golden vineyards and the villages of man.</p>
<p>“I saw the towering mountains with hanging fields of eternal snow.</p>
<p>“I saw the fruitfulness and fortune of the earth.</p>
<p>“None but I saw the fortune of man.</p>
<p>“You, my soul, force mortal men to labor and suffer for your salvation. I demand that you do this for the earthly fortune of humankind. Pay heed! I speak in both my name and the name of mankind, since our power and glory are yours, thine is the kingdom and our promised land. So bring it about, employing your abundance! I will remain silent, yes, I will leave you be, it depends on you; you can bring about what man is denied to create. I stand waiting. Torment yourself, so that you come to find it. Where is your own salvation, if you fail in your duty to bring about that of man? Pay heed! You will be working for me, and I will remain silent.”</p>
<p>“Now then,” she said, “I want to set to work. But you must build the furnace. Throw the old, the broken, the worn out, the unused, and the ruined into the melting pot, so that it will be renewed for fresh use.</p>
<p>“It is the custom of the ancients, the tradition of the ancestors, observed since days of old. It is to be adapted for new use. It is practice and incubation in a smelter, a taking-back into the interior, into the hot accumulation where rust and brokenness are taken away through the heat of the fire. It is a holy ceremony, help me so that my work may succeed.</p>
<p>“Touch the earth, press your hand into matter, shape it with care. The power of matter is great. Did HAP not come from matter? Is matter not the filling of emptiness? By forming matter, I shape your salvation. If you do not doubt the power of HAP, how can you doubt the power of its mother, matter? Matter is stronger than HAP, since HAP is the son of the earth. The hardest matter is the best; you should form the most durable matter. This strengthens thought.”</p>
<p>{6} I did as my soul advised, and formed in matter the thoughts that she gave me. She spoke often and at length to me about the wisdom that lies behind us.72 But one night she suddenly came to me with a sense of unease and anxiety and exclaimed:73 “What am I seeing? What does the future harbor? Blazing fire? A fire hovers in the air—it draws near—a flame—many flames—a searing miracle—how many lights burn? My beloved, it is the mercy of the eternal fire—the breath of fire descends on you!”</p>
<p>But I cried out in horror, “I fear something terrible and dreadful, I am deeply afraid, since the things that you announced beforehand were awful—must everything be broken, burned, and destroyed?”</p>
<p>“Patience,” she said and stared into the distance, “fire surrounds you—an immeasurable sea of embers.”</p>
<p>“Don’t torture me—what dreadful mysteries do you possess? Speak, I implore you. Or are you lying again, damned tormenting spirit, deceiving fiend? What are your treacherous specters supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>But she answered calmly, “I also want your fear.”</p>
<p>“What for? To torment me?”</p>
<p>But she continued, “To bring it before the ruler of this world.74 He demands the sacrifice of your fear. He appreciates your sacrifice. He75 has mercy upon you.”</p>
<p>“Mercy upon me? What is that supposed to mean? I want to hide myself from him. My face shrinks from the ruler of this world, for it is branded, it bears a mark, it beheld the forbidden. Therefore I avoid the ruler of this world.”</p>
<p>“But you should come before him,” she said, “he has heard about your fear.”</p>
<p>“You instilled this fear in me. Why did you give me away?”</p>
<p>“You have been summoned to serve him.”</p>
<p>But I moaned and exclaimed: “Thrice damned fate! Why can’t you leave me in seclusion? Why has he chosen me for sacrifice? Thousands would gladly throw themselves before him! Why must it be me? I cannot, I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>But the soul said, “You possess the word that should not be allowed to remain concealed.”</p>
<p>“What is my word?” I answered. “It is the stammering of a minor; it is my poverty and my incapacity, my inability to do otherwise. And you want to drag this before the ruler of this world?”</p>
<p>But she looked straight into the distance and said, “I see the surface of the earth and smoke sweeps over it—a sea of fire rolls close in from the north, it is setting the towns and villages on fire, plunging over the mountains, breaking through the valleys, burning the forests—people are going mad—you go before the fire in a burning robe with singed hair, a crazy look in your eyes, a parched tongue, a hoarse and foul-sounding voice—you forge ahead, you announce what approaches, you scale the mountains, you go into every valley and stammer words of fright and proclaim the fire’s agony. You bear the mark of the fire and men are horrified at you. They do not see the fire, they do not believe your words, but they see your mark and unknowingly suspect you to be the messenger of the burning agony. What fire? they ask, what fire? You stutter, you stammer, what do you know about a fire? I looked at the embers, I saw the blazing flames. May God save us.”</p>
<p>“My soul,” I cried in despair, “speak, explain, what should I proclaim? The fire? Which fire?”</p>
<p>“Look up, see the flames that blaze over your head—look up, the skies redden.”</p>
<p>With these words my soul vanished.</p>
<p>But I remained anxious and confused for many days. And my soul remained silent and was not to be seen.76 But one night a dark crowd knocked at my door, and I trembled with fear. Then my soul appeared and said in haste, “They are here and will tear open your door.”</p>
<p>“So that the wicked herd can break into my garden? Should I be plundered and thrown out onto the street? You make me into an ape and a child’s plaything. When, Oh my God, shall I be saved from this Hell of fools? But I want to hack to pieces your cursed webs, go to Hell, you fools. What do you want with me?”</p>
<p>But she interrupted me and said, “What are you talking about? Let the dark ones speak.”</p>
<p>I retorted, “How can I trust you? You work for yourself, not for me. What good are you, if you can’t even protect me from the devil’s confusion?”</p>
<p>“Be quiet,” she replied, “or else you’ll disturb the work.”</p>
<p>And as she spoke these words, behold, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ came up to me, dressed in the white robe of a priest, and lay his hand on my shoulder.77 Then I said to the dark ones, “So speak, you dead.” And immediately they cried in many voices,78 “We have come back from Jerusalem, where we did not find what we sought.79 We implore you to let us in. You have what we desire. Not your blood, but your light. That is it.”</p>
<p>Then ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ lifted his voice and taught them, saying80 (and this is the first sermon to the dead)81:</p>
<p>“Now hear: I begin with nothingness. Nothingness is the same as the fullness. In infinity full is as good as empty. Nothingness is empty and full. You might just as well say anything else about nothingness, for instance, that it is white, or black, or that it does not exist, or that it exists. That which is endless and eternal has no qualities, since it has all qualities.</p>
<p>“We call this nothingness or fullness the <em>Pleroma</em>.82 Therein both thinking and being cease, since the eternal and endless possess no qualities. No one is in it, for he would then be distinct from the Pleroma, and would possess qualities that would distinguish him as something distinct from the Pleroma.</p>
<p>“In the Pleroma there is nothing and everything. It is fruitless to think about the Pleroma, for this would mean self-dissolution.</p>
<p>“<em>Creation</em> is not in the Pleroma, but in itself. The Pleroma is the beginning and end of creation.83 It pervades creation, just as the sunlight pervades the air. Although the Pleroma is altogether pervasive, creation has no share in it, just as a wholly transparent body becomes neither light nor dark through the light pervading it.</p>
<p>“We are, however, the Pleroma itself, for we are a part of the eternal and the endless. But we have no share therein, as we are infinitely removed from the Pleroma; not spatially or temporally, but <em>essentially</em>, since we are distinguished from the Pleroma in our essence as creation, which is confined within time and space.</p>
<p>“Yet because we are parts of the Pleroma, the Pleroma is also in us. Even in the smallest point the Pleroma is endless, eternal, and whole, since small and great are qualities that are contained in it. It is nothingness that is whole and continuous throughout. Only figuratively, therefore, do I speak of creation as part of the Pleroma. Because, actually, the Pleroma is nowhere divided, since it is nothingness. We are also the whole Pleroma, because, figuratively, the Pleroma is the smallest point in us, merely assumed, not existing, and the boundless firmament about us. But why then do we speak of the Pleroma at all, if it is everything and nothing?</p>
<p>“I speak about it in order to begin somewhere, and also to free you from the delusion that somewhere without or within there is something fixed or in some way established from the outset. Every so-called fixed and certain thing is only relative. That alone is fixed and certain that is subject to change.</p>
<p>“Creation, however, is subject to change; therefore it alone is fixed and determined because it has qualities: indeed, it is quality itself.</p>
<p>“Thus we ask: how did the creation come into being? Creatures came into being, but not creation: since creation is the very quality of the Pleroma, as much as noncreation, eternal death. Creation is ever-present, and so is death. The Pleroma has everything, differentiation and nondifferentiation.</p>
<p>“Differentiation84 is creation. It is differentiated. Differentiation is its essence, and therefore it differentiates. Therefore man differentiates, since his essence is differentiation. Therefore he also differentiates the qualities of the Pleroma that do not exist. He differentiates them on account of his own essence. Therefore he must speak of those qualities of the Pleroma that do not exist.</p>
<p>“You say: ‘what use is there in speaking about it at all?’ Did you yourself not say that it is not worth thinking about the Pleroma?</p>
<p>“I mentioned that to free you from the delusion that we are able to think about the Pleroma. When we distinguish the qualities of the Pleroma, we are speaking from the ground of our own differentiated state and about our own differentiation, but have effectively said nothing about the Pleroma. Yet we need to speak about our own differentiation, so that we may sufficiently differentiate ourselves. Our very nature is differentiation. If we are not true to this nature we do not differentiate ourselves enough. We must therefore make distinctions between qualities.</p>
<p>“You ask: ‘what harm is there in not differentiating oneself?’ If we do not differentiate, we move beyond our essence, beyond creation, and we fall into nondifferentiation, which is the other quality of the Pleroma. We fall into the Pleroma itself and cease to be created beings. We lapse into dissolution in nothingness. This is the death of the creature. Therefore we die to the same extent that we do not differentiate. Hence the creature’s essence strives toward differentiation and struggles against primeval, perilous sameness. This is called the <em>principium individuationis</em>.85 This principle is the essence of the creature. From this you can see why nondifferentiation and nondistinction pose a great danger to the creature.</p>
<p>“We must, therefore, distinguish the qualities of the Pleroma. These qualities are <em>pairs of opposites</em>, such as</p>
<p>“the effective and the ineffective,</p>
<p>the fullness and the emptiness,</p>
<p>the living and the dead,</p>
<p>the different and the same,</p>
<p>light and darkness,</p>
<p>hot and cold,</p>
<p>force and matter,</p>
<p>time and space,</p>
<p>good and evil,</p>
<p>the beautiful and the ugly,</p>
<p>the one and the many, etc.</p>
<p>“The pairs of opposites are the qualities of the Pleroma that do not exist, because they cancel themselves out. As we are the Pleroma itself, we also have all these qualities in us. Since our nature is grounded in differentiation, we have these qualities in the name and under the sign of differentiation, which means:</p>
<p>“First: these qualities are differentiated and separate in us; therefore they do not cancel each other out, but are effective. Thus we are the victims of the pairs of opposites. The Pleroma is rent within us.</p>
<p>“Second: these qualities belong to the Pleroma, and we must possess and live them only in the name and under the sign of differentiation. We must differentiate ourselves from these qualities. They cancel each other out in the Pleroma, but not in us. Distinction from them saves us.</p>
<p>“When we strive for the good or the beautiful, we forget our essence, which is differentiation, and we fall subject to the spell of the qualities of the Pleroma, which are the pairs of opposites. We endeavor to attain the good and the beautiful, yet at the same time we also seize the evil and the ugly, since in the Pleroma these are one with the good and the beautiful. But if we remain true to our essence, which is differentiation, we differentiate ourselves from the good and the beautiful, and hence from the evil and ugly. And thus we do not fall under the spell of the Pleroma, namely into nothingness and dissolution.86</p>
<p>“You object: you said that difference and sameness are also qualities of the Pleroma. What is it like if we strive for distinctiveness? Are we, in so doing, not true to our own nature? And must we nonetheless fall into sameness when we strive for distinctiveness?</p>
<p>“You must not forget that the Pleroma has no qualities. We create these through thinking. If, therefore, you strive for distinctiveness or sameness, or any qualities whatsoever, you pursue thoughts that flow to you out of the Pleroma: thoughts, namely, concerning the non-existing qualities of the Pleroma. Inasmuch as you run after these thoughts, you fall again into the Pleroma, and attain distinctiveness and sameness at the same time. Not your thinking, but your essence, is differentiation. Therefore you must not strive for what you conceive as distinctiveness, but for <em>your own essence</em>. At bottom, therefore, there is only one striving, namely the striving for one’s own essence. If you had this striving, you would not need to know anything about the Pleroma and its qualities, and yet you would attain the right goal by virtue of your own essence. Since, however, thought alienates us from our essence, I must teach you that knowledge with which you can bridle your thoughts.”</p>
<p>87The dead faded away grumbling and moaning and their cries died away in the distance.</p>
<p>88But I turned to ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and said, “My father, you utter strange teachings. Did not the ancients teach similar things? And was it not a reprehensible heresy, removed equally from love and the truth? And why do you lay out such a teaching to this horde, which the night wind swirled up from the dark bloodfields of the West?”</p>
<p>“My son,” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied, “these dead ended their lives too early. These were seekers and therefore still hover over their graves. Their lives were incomplete, since they knew no way beyond the one to which belief had abandoned them. But since no one teaches them, I must do so. That is what love demands, since they wanted to hear, even if they grumble. But why do I impart this teaching of the ancients? I teach in this way because their Christian faith once discarded and persecuted precisely this teaching. But they repudiated Christian belief and hence were rejected by that faith. They do not know this and therefore I must teach them, so that their life may be fulfilled and they can enter into death.”</p>
<p>“But do you, Oh wise ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, believe what you teach?”</p>
<p>“My son,” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied, “why do you raise this question? How could I teach what I believe? Who would give me the right to such belief? It is what I know how to say, not because I believe it, but because I know it. If I knew better, I would teach better. But it would be easy for me to believe more. Yet should I teach a belief to those who have discarded belief? And, I ask you, is it good to believe something even more, if one does not know better?”89</p>
<p>“But,” I retorted, “are you certain that things really are as you say?”</p>
<p>To this ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered, “I do not know whether it is the best that one can know. But I know nothing better and therefore I am certain these things are as I say. If they were otherwise I would say something else, since I would know them to be otherwise. But these things are as I know them, since my knowledge is precisely these things themselves.”</p>
<p>“My father, is that your guarantee that you are not mistaken?”</p>
<p>“There are no mistakes in these things,” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied, “there are only different levels of knowledge. These things are as you know them. Only in your world are things always other than you know them, and therefore there are only mistakes in your world.”</p>
<p>After these words ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ bent down and touched the earth with his hands and disappeared.</p>
<p>{7} That night ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ stood beside me and the dead drew near and lined the walls and cried out,90 “We want to know about God. Where is God? Is God dead?”91</p>
<p>But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ rose and said (and this is the second sermon to the dead):</p>
<p>“God is not dead. He is as alive as ever. God is creation, for he is something definite, and therefore differentiated from the Pleroma. God is a quality of the Pleroma, and everything I have said about creation also applies to him.</p>
<p>“But he is distinct from creation in that he is much more indefinite and indeterminable. He is less differentiated than creation, since the ground of his essence is effective fullness. Only insofar as he is definite and differentiated is he creation, and as such he is the manifestation of the effective fullness of the Pleroma.</p>
<p>“Everything that we do not differentiate falls into the Pleroma and is cancelled out by its opposite. If, therefore, we do not differentiate God, effective fullness is canceled out for us.</p>
<p>“Moreover, God is the Pleroma itself, just as each smallest point in the created and uncreated is the Pleroma itself.</p>
<p>“Effective emptiness is the essence of the devil. God and devil are the first manifestations of nothingness, which we call the Pleroma. It makes no difference whether the Pleroma exists or not, since it cancels itself out completely. Not so creation. Insofar as God and the devil are created beings, they do not cancel each other out, but stand one against the other as effective opposites. We need no proof of their existence. It is enough that we have to keep speaking about them. Even if both were not, creation would forever distinguish them anew out of the Pleroma on account of their distinct essences.</p>
<p>“Everything that differentiation takes out of the Pleroma is a pair of opposites, therefore the devil always belongs to God.92</p>
<p>“This inseparability is most intimate and, as you know from experience, as indissoluble in your life as the Pleroma itself, since both stand very close to the Pleroma in which all opposites are canceled out and united.</p>
<p>“Fullness and emptiness, generation and destruction, are what distinguish God and the devil. <em>Effectiveness</em> is common to both. Effectiveness joins them. Effectiveness, therefore, stands above both, and is a God above God, since it unites fullness and emptiness through its effectuality.</p>
<p>“This is a God you knew nothing about, because mankind forgot him. We call him by his name <em>ABRAXAS</em>.93 He is even more indefinite than God and the devil.</p>
<p>“To distinguish him from God, we call God <em>HELIOS</em> or sun.94 Abraxas is effect. Nothing stands opposed to him but the ineffective; hence his effective nature unfolds itself freely. The ineffective neither exists nor resists. Abraxas stands above the sun and above the devil. He is improbable probability, that which takes unreal effect. If the Pleroma had an essence, Abraxas would be its manifestation.</p>
<p>“He is the effectual itself, not any particular effect, but effect in general.</p>
<p>“He takes unreal effect, because he has no definite effect.</p>
<p>“He is also creation, since he is distinct from the Pleroma.</p>
<p>“The sun has a definite effect, and so does the devil. Therefore they appear to us more effective than the indefinite Abraxas.</p>
<p>“He is force, duration, change.”</p>
<p>95The dead now raised a great tumult, for they were Christians.</p>
<p>But when ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had ended his speech, one after another the dead also stepped back into the darkness once more and the noise of their outrage gradually died away in the distance. When all the clamor had passed, I turned to ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Pity us, wisest one! You take from men the Gods to whom they could pray. You take alms from the beggar, bread from the hungry, fire from the freezing.”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered and said, “My son, these dead have had to reject the belief of the Christians and therefore they can pray to no God. So should I teach them a God in whom they can believe and to whom they can pray? That is precisely what they have rejected. Why did they reject it? They had to reject it because they could not do otherwise. And why did they have no other choice? Because the world, without these men knowing it, entered into that month of the great year where one should believe only what one knows.96 That is difficult enough, but it is also a remedy for the long sickness that arose from the fact that one believed what one did not know. I teach them the God whom both I and they know of without being aware of him, a God in whom one does not believe and to whom one does not pray, but of whom one knows. I teach this God to the dead since they desired entry and teaching. But I do not teach him to living men since they did not desire my teaching. Why, indeed, should I teach them? Therefore, I take away from them no kindly hearer of prayers, their father in Heaven. What concern is my foolishness to the living? The dead need salvation, since they are a great waiting flock hovering over their graves, and long for the knowledge that belief and the rejection of belief have breathed their last. But whoever has fallen ill and is near death wants knowledge, and he sacrifices pardon.”</p>
<p>“It appears,” I replied, “as if you teach a terrible and dreadful God beyond measure, to whom good and evil and human suffering and joy are nothing.”</p>
<p>“My son,” said ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, “did you not see that these dead had a God of love and rejected him? Should I teach them a loving God? They had to reject him after already having long since rejected the evil God whom they call the devil. Therefore they must know a God to whom everything created is nothing, because he himself is the creator and everything created and the destruction of everything created. Have they not rejected a God who is a father, a lover, good and beautiful? One whom they thought to have particular qualities and a particular being? Therefore I must teach a God to whom nothing can be attributed, who has all qualities and therefore none, because only I and they can know such a God.”</p>
<p>“But how, Oh my father, can men unite in such a God? Does the knowledge of such a God not amount to destroying human bonds and every society based on the good and the beautiful?”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered: “These dead rejected the God of love, of the good and the beautiful; they had to reject him and so they rejected unity and community in love, in the good and the beautiful. And thus they killed one another and dissolved the community of men. Should I teach them the God who united them in love and whom they rejected? Therefore I teach them the God who dissolves unity, who blasts everything human, who powerfully creates and mightily destroys. Those whom love does not unite, fear compels.”</p>
<p>And as ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ spoke these words, he bent down swiftly to the ground, touched it with his hand, and disappeared.</p>
<p>{8} The following night,97 the dead approached like fog from a swamp and exclaimed, “Tell us more about the highest God.”</p>
<p>And ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ stepped forward and began to speak (and this is the third sermon to the dead)98:</p>
<p>“Abraxas is the God who is difficult to grasp. His power is greatest, because man does not see it. From the sun he draws the <em>summum bonum</em>;99 from the devil the <em>infinum malum</em>; but from Abraxas <em>LIFE</em>, altogether indefinite, the mother of good and evil.100</p>
<p>“Life seems to be smaller and weaker than the <em>summum bonum</em>; therefore it is also hard to conceive that Abraxas’s power transcends even the sun’s, which is the radiant source of all vital force.</p>
<p>“Abraxas is the sun, and at the same time the eternally sucking gorge of emptiness, of the diminisher and dismemberer, of the devil.</p>
<p>The power of Abraxas is twofold; but you do not see it, because in your eyes the warring opposites of this power are canceled out.</p>
<p>“What the Sun God speaks is life, what the devil speaks is death.</p>
<p>“But Abraxas speaks that hallowed and accursed word that is at once life and death.</p>
<p>“Abraxas produces truth and lying, good and evil, light and darkness, in the same word and in the same act. Therefore Abraxas is terrible.</p>
<p>“He is as splendid as the lion in the instant he strikes down his victim. He is as beautiful as a spring day.</p>
<p>“He is the great and the small Pan alike.</p>
<p>“He is Priapos.</p>
<p>“He is the monster of the underworld, a thousand-armed polyp, a coiled knot of winged serpents, frenzy.</p>
<p>“He is the hermaphrodite of the earliest beginning.</p>
<p>“He is the lord of toads and frogs, which live in the water and go up on the land, whose chorus ascends at noon and at midnight.</p>
<p>“He is the fullness that seeks union with emptiness.</p>
<p>“He is holy begetting,</p>
<p>“He is love and its murder,</p>
<p>“He is the saint and his betrayer,</p>
<p>“He is the brightest light of day and the darkest night of madness.</p>
<p>“To look upon him, is blindness.</p>
<p>“To recognize him is sickness.</p>
<p>“To worship him is death.</p>
<p>“To fear him is wisdom.</p>
<p>“Not to resist him is redemption.</p>
<p>“God dwells behind the sun, the devil behind the night. What God brings forth out of the light, the devil sucks into the night. But Abraxas is the world, its becoming and its passing. Upon every gift that comes from the sun god the devil lays his curse.</p>
<p>“Everything that you request from the Sun God produces a deed from the devil. Everything that you create with the Sun God gives effective power to the devil.</p>
<p>“That is terrible Abraxas.</p>
<p>“He is the mightiest created being and in him creation is afraid of itself.</p>
<p>“He is the manifest opposition of creation to the Pleroma and its nothingness.</p>
<p>“He is the son’s horror of the mother.</p>
<p>“He is the mother’s love for the son.</p>
<p>“He is the delight of the earth and the cruelty of the heavens.</p>
<p>“At his sight man’s face congeals.</p>
<p>“Before him there is no question and no reply.</p>
<p>“He is the life of creation.</p>
<p>“He is the effect of differentiation.</p>
<p>“He is the love of man.</p>
<p>“He is the speech of man.</p>
<p>“He is the appearance and the shadow of man.</p>
<p>“He is deceptive reality.”101</p>
<p>102Now the dead howled and raged, for they were incomplete.</p>
<p>But when their noisy cries had faded away, I said to ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ: “How, Oh my father, should I understand this God?”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered and said:</p>
<p>“My son, why do you want to understand him? This God is to be known but not understood. If you understand him, then you can say that he is this or that and this and not that. Thus you hold him in the hollow of your hand and therefore your hand must throw him away. The God whom I know is this and that and just as much this other and that other. Therefore no one can understand this God, but it is possible to know him, and therefore I speak and teach him.”</p>
<p>“But,” I retorted, “does this God not bring despairing confusion into the minds of men?”</p>
<p>To this ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said, “These dead rejected the order of unity and community since they rejected the belief in the father in Heaven who ruled with just measure. They had to reject him. Therefore I teach them the chaos that is without measure and utterly boundless, to which justice and injustice, leniency and severity, patience and anger, love and hate, are nothing. For how can I teach anything other than the God whom I know and whom they know, without being conscious of him?”</p>
<p>I replied, “Why, Oh solemn one, do you call the eternally incomprehensible, the cruel contradictoriness of nature, God?”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said, “How should I name it otherwise? If the overpowering essence of events in the universe and in the hearts of men were law, I would call it law. Yet it is also no law, but chance, irregularity, sin, error, stupidity, carelessness, folly, illegality. Therefore I cannot call it law. You know that this must be so, and at the same time you know that it did not have to be so and that at some other time it will not be so. It is overpowering and occurs as if from eternal law, and at another time a slanting wind blows a speck of dust into the works and this void is a superior strength, harder than a mountain of iron. Therefore you know that the eternal law is also no law. So I cannot call it law. But how else should it be named? I know that human language has forever named the maternal womb of the incomprehensible God. Truly, this God is and is not, since from being and nonbeing everything emerged that was, is, and will be.”</p>
<p>But when ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had spoken the last word, he touched the earth with his hand and dissolved.</p>
<p>{9} The following night, the dead came running sooner, filling the place with their mutterings, and said:</p>
<p>“Speak to us about Gods and devils, accursed one.”</p>
<p>And ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ appeared and began to speak (and this is the fourth sermon to the dead)103:</p>
<p>“The Sun God is the highest good, the devil the opposite. Thus you have two Gods. But there are many high and good things and many great evils. Among these are two devil Gods; one is the <em>Burning One</em>, the other the <em>Growing One</em>.</p>
<p>“The burning one is <em>EROS</em>, in the form of a flame. It shines by consuming.104</p>
<p>“The growing one is the <em>TREE OF LIFE</em>. It greens by heaping up growing living matter.105</p>
<p>“Eros flames up and dies. But the tree of life grows with slow and constant increase through measureless periods of time.</p>
<p>“Good and evil unite in the flame.</p>
<p>“Good and evil unite in the growth of the tree. In their divinity life and love stand opposed.</p>
<p>“The number of Gods and devils is as innumerable as the host of stars.</p>
<p>“Each star is a God, and each space that a star fills is a devil. But the empty fullness of the whole is the Pleroma.</p>
<p>“Abraxas is the effect of the whole, and only the ineffective opposes him.</p>
<p>“Four is the number of the principal Gods, as four is the number of the world’s measurements.</p>
<p>“One is the beginning, the Sun God.</p>
<p>“Two is Eros, for he binds two together and spreads himself out in brightness.</p>
<p>“Three is the Tree of Life, for it fills space with bodies.</p>
<p>“Four is the devil, for he opens all that is closed. He dissolves everything formed and physical; he is the destroyer in whom everything becomes nothing.</p>
<p>“Happy am I who can recognize the multiplicity and diversity of the Gods. But woe unto you, who replace this incompatible multiplicity with a single God. In so doing you produce the torment of incomprehension, and mutilate the creation whose nature and aim is differentiation. How can you be true to your own nature when you try to turn the many into one? What you do unto the Gods is done likewise unto you. You all become equal and thus your nature106 is maimed.</p>
<p>“Equality prevails not for the sake of God, but only for the sake of man. For the Gods are many, while men are few. The Gods are mighty and endure their manifoldness. Like the stars they abide in solitude, separated by vast distances. Therefore they dwell together and need communion, so that they may bear their separateness.107 For redemption’s sake I teach you the reprehensible, for whose sake I was rejected.</p>
<p>“The multiplicity of the Gods corresponds to the multiplicity of men.</p>
<p>“Numberless Gods await the human state. Numberless Gods have been men. Man shares in the nature of the Gods. He comes from the Gods and goes unto the God.</p>
<p>“Thus, just as it is no use to reflect upon the Pleroma, it is not worthwhile to worship the multiplicity of the Gods. Least of all does it serve to worship the first God, the effective fullness, and the <em>summum bonum</em>. By our prayer we can add nothing to it, and take nothing from it; because effective emptiness gulps down everything.108 The bright Gods form the heavenly world. It is manifold and extends and increases infinitely. The Sun God is the supreme lord of the world.</p>
<p>“The dark Gods form the earthly world. It is simple and diminishes and declines infinitely. The devil is its nethermost lord, the moon spirit, satellite of the earth, smaller, colder, and more dead than the earth.</p>
<p>“There is no difference between the might of the heavenly and earthly Gods. The heavenly Gods magnify, the earthly Gods diminish. Both directions are immeasurable.”</p>
<p>109Here the dead interrupted ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ’s speech with angry laughter and mocking shouts, and as they withdrew, their discord, mockery, and laughter faded into the distance. I turned to ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and said to him:</p>
<p>“Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, I believe you are mistaken. It seems that you teach a raw superstition which the Fathers had successfully and gloriously overcome, that polytheism which a mind produces only when it cannot free its gaze from the force of compulsive desire chained to sensory things.”</p>
<p>“My son,” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied, “these dead have rejected the single and highest God. So how can I teach them about the one, only, and not multifarious God? They must of course believe me. But they have rejected their belief. So I teach them the God that I know, the multifarious and extended, who is both the thing and its appearance, and they also know him even if they are not conscious of him.</p>
<p>“These dead have given names to all beings, the beings in the air, on the earth and in the water. They have weighed and counted things. They have counted so and so many horses, cows, sheep, trees, segments of land, and springs; they said, this is good for this purpose, and that is good for that one. What did they do with the admirable tree? What happened to the sacred frog? Did they see his golden eye? Where is the atonement for the 7,777 cattle whose blood they spilled, whose flesh they consumed? Did they do penance for the sacred ore that they dug up from the belly of the earth? No, they named, weighed, numbered, and apportioned all things. They did whatever pleased them. And what did they do! You saw the powerful—but this is precisely how they gave power to things unknowingly. Yet the time has come when things speak. The piece of flesh says: how many men? The piece of ore says, how many men? The ship says, how many men? The coal says, how many men? The house says: how many men? And things rise and number and weigh and apportion and devour millions of men.</p>
<p>“Your hand grasped the earth and tore off the halo and weighed and numbered the bones of things. Is not the one and only, simpleminded God pulled down and thrown onto a heap, the massed seeming of separate things dead and living? Yes, this God taught you to weigh and number bones. But the month of this God is drawing to a close. A new month stands at the door. Therefore everything had to be as it is, and hence everything must become different.</p>
<p>“This is no polytheism that I have made up! But many Gods who powerfully raise their voices and tear humanity to bloody pieces. So and so many men, weighed, numbered, apportioned, hacked, and devoured. Therefore I speak of many Gods as I speak of many things, since I know them. Why do I call them Gods? For the sake of their superiority. Do you know about this superior strength? Now is the time when you can learn.</p>
<p>“These dead laugh at my foolishness. But would they have raised a murderous hand against their brothers if they had atoned for the ox with the velvet eyes? If they had done penance for the shiny ore? If they had worshiped the holy trees?110 If they had made peace with the soul of the golden-eyed frog? What say things dead and living? Who is greater, man or the Gods? Truly, this sun has become a moon and no new sun has arisen from the contractions of the last hour of the night.”</p>
<p>And when he had finished these words, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ bent down to the earth, kissed it, and said, “Mother, may your son be strong.” Then he stood, looked up at the heavens, and said, “How dark is your place of the new light.” Then he disappeared.</p>
<p>{10} When the following night came, the dead approached noisily, pushing and shoving; they were scoffing and exclaimed, “Teach us, fool, about the church and holy communion.”</p>
<p>But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ stepped before them, and began to speak:111 (and this is the fifth sermon to the dead):</p>
<p>“The world of the Gods is made manifest in spirituality and in sexuality. The celestial ones appear in spirituality, the earthly in sexuality.112</p>
<p>“Spirituality conceives and embraces. It is womanlike and therefore we call it <em>MATER COELESTIS</em>,113 the celestial mother. Sexuality engenders and creates. It is manlike, and therefore we call it <em>PHALLOS</em>,114 the earthly father.115 The sexuality of man is more earthly, that of woman is more spiritual. The spirituality of man is more heavenly, it moves toward the greater.</p>
<p>“The spirituality of woman is more earthly, it moves toward the smaller.</p>
<p>“Mendacious and devilish is the spirituality of man, and it moves toward the smaller.</p>
<p>“Mendacious and devilish is the spirituality of woman, and it moves toward the greater.</p>
<p>“Each shall go to its own place.</p>
<p>“Man and woman become devils to each other if they do not separate their spiritual ways, for the essence of creation is differentiation.</p>
<p>“The sexuality of man goes toward the earthly, the sexuality of woman goes toward the spiritual. Man and woman become devils to each other if they do not distinguish their sexuality.</p>
<p>“Man shall know the smaller, woman the greater.</p>
<p>“Man shall differentiate himself both from spirituality and sexuality. He shall call spirituality mother, and set her between Heaven and earth. He shall call sexuality Phallos, and set him between himself and earth. For the mother and the Phallos are superhuman daimons that reveal the world of the Gods. They affect us more than the Gods since they are closely akin to our essence.116 If you do not differentiate yourselves from sexuality and from spirituality, and do not regard them as an essence both above and beyond you, you are delivered over to them as qualities of the Pleroma. Spirituality and sexuality are not your qualities, not things you possess and encompass. Rather, they possess and encompass you, since they are powerful daimons, manifestations of the Gods, and hence reach beyond you, existing in themselves. No man has a spirituality unto himself, or a sexuality unto himself. Instead, he stands under the law of spirituality and of sexuality. Therefore no one escapes these daimons. You shall look upon them as daimons, and as a common task and danger, a common burden that life has laid upon you. Thus life, too, is for you a common task and danger, as are the Gods, and first and foremost terrible Abraxas.</p>
<p>“Man is weak, and community is therefore indispensable. If your community is not under the sign of the mother, it is under the sign of the Phallos. Absence of community is suffering and sickness. Community in everything is dismemberment and dissolution.</p>
<p>“Differentiation leads to singleness. Singleness is opposed to community. But because of man’s weakness with regard to the Gods and daimons and their invincible law, community is necessary, not for man’s sake, but because of the Gods. The Gods drive you to community. Insofar as the Gods impose community upon you, it is necessary; more is bad.</p>
<p>“In the community every man shall submit to others, so that the community be maintained, for you need it.</p>
<p>“In singleness every man shall place himself above the other, so that every man may come to himself and avoid slavery.</p>
<p>“Abstention shall hold good in community, extravagance in singleness.</p>
<p>“Community is depth, singleness is height.</p>
<p>“Right measure in community purifies and preserves.</p>
<p>“Right measure in singleness purifies and increases.</p>
<p>“Community gives us warmth, singleness gives us light.”117</p>
<p>{11}When ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had finished, the dead remained silent and did not move, but looked at ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ with expectation. But when ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ saw that the dead remained silent and waited, he continued (and this is the sixth sermon to the dead)118:</p>
<p>“The daimon of sexuality approaches our soul as a serpent. She is half human soul and is called thought-desire.</p>
<p>“The daimon of spirituality descends into our soul as the white bird. He is half human soul and is called desire-thought.</p>
<p>“The serpent is an earthly soul, half daimonic, a spirit, and akin to the spirits of the dead. Thus too, like these she swarms around in the things of earth, making us fear them or else having them arouse our craving. The serpent has a female nature, forever seeking the company of those dead who are spellbound by the earth, and who did not find a way across to singleness. The serpent is a whore. She courts the devil and evil spirits; she is a mischievous tyrant and tormentor, forever inveigling the most evil company. The white bird is a half-celestial soul of man. He abides with the mother, descending from time to time. The bird is manlike, and is effective thought. He is chaste and solitary, a messenger of the mother. He flies high above the earth. He commands singleness. He brings knowledge from the distant ones, who have departed before and attained perfection. He bears our word up to the mother. She intercedes, she warns, but she is powerless against the Gods. She is a vessel of the sun. The serpent descends and cunningly lames the phallic daimon, or else goads him on. She bears up the too-crafty thoughts of the earthly, those thoughts that creep through every hole and cleave to all things with craving. Although the serpent does not want to, she must be of use to us. She flees our grasp, thus showing us the way, which our human wits could not find.”</p>
<p>119When ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had finished, the dead looked on with contempt and said, “Cease this talk of Gods and daimons and souls. We have known this for a long time.”</p>
<p>But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ smiled and replied, “You poor souls, poor in flesh and rich in spirit, the meat was fat and the spirit thin. But how do you reach the eternal light? You mock my stupidity, which you too possess: you mock yourselves. Knowledge frees one from danger. But mockery is the other side of your belief. Is black less than white? You rejected faith and retained mockery. Are you thus saved from faith? No, you bound yourselves to mockery and hence again to faith. And therefore you are miserable.”</p>
<p>But the dead were outraged and cried, “We are not miserable, we are clever; our thinking and feeling is as pure as clear water. We praise our reason. We mock superstition. Do you believe that your old folly reaches us? A childish delusion has overcome you, old one, what good is it to us?”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied: “What can do you any good? I free you from what still holds you to the shadow of life. Take this wisdom with you, add this folly to your cleverness, this unreason to your reason, and you will find yourselves. If you were men, you would then begin your life and your life’s way between reason and unreason and live onward to the eternal light, whose shadow you lived in advance. But since you are dead, this knowledge frees you from life and strips you of your greed for men and it also frees your self from the shrouds that the light and the shadow lay on you, compassion with men will overcome you and from the stream you will reach solid ground, you will step forth from the eternal whirl onto the unmoving stone of rest, the circle that breaks flowing duration, and the flame will die down.</p>
<p>“I have fanned a glowing fire, I have given the murderer a knife, I have torn open healed-over wounds, I have quickened all movement, I have given the madman more intoxicating drink, I have made the cold colder, the heat hotter, falseness even falser, goodness even better, weakness even weaker.</p>
<p>“This knowledge is the axe of the sacrificer.”</p>
<p>But the dead cried, “Your wisdom is foolishness and a curse. You want to turn the wheel back? It will tear you apart, blinded one!”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied, “So this is what happened. The earth became green and fruitful again from the blood of the sacrifice, flowers sprouted, the waves crash into the sand, a silver cloud lies at the foot of the mountain, a bird of the soul came to men, the hoe sounds in the fields and the axe in the forests, a wind rushes through the trees and the sun shimmers in the dew of the risen morning, the planets behold the birth, out of the earth climbed the many-armed, the stones speak and the grass whispers. Man found himself, and the Gods wander through Heaven, the fullness gives birth to the golden drop, the golden seed, plumed and hovering.”</p>
<p>The dead now fell silent and stared at ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and slowly crept away. But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ bent down to the ground and said: “It is accomplished, but not fulfilled. Fruit of the earth, sprout, rise up—and Heaven, pour out the water of life.”</p>
<p>Then ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ disappeared.</p>
<p>120I was probably very confused when ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ approached me the following night, since I called to him saying, “What did you do, Oh ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ? What fires have you kindled? What have you broken asunder? Does the wheel of creations stand still?”</p>
<p>But he answered and said, “Everything is running its usual course. Nothing has happened, and yet a sweet and indescribable mystery has taken place: I stepped out of the whirling circle.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” I exclaimed. “Your words move my lips, your voice sounds from my ears, my eyes see you from within me. Truly, you are a magician! You stepped out of the whirling circle? What confusion! Are you I, am I you? Did I not feel as if the wheel of creation was standing still? And yet you say that you have stepped out of the whirling circle? I am truly bound to the wheel—I feel the rushing swaying of it—and yet the wheel of creation also stands still for me. What did you do, father, teach me!”</p>
<p>Then ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said, “I stepped onto what is solid and took it with me and saved it from the wave surge, from the cycle of births, and from the revolving wheel of endless happening. It has been stilled. The dead have received the folly of the teaching, they have been blinded by truth and see by mistake. They have recognized, felt, and regretted it; they will come again and will humbly inquire. Since what they rejected will be most valuable to them.”</p>
<p>I wanted to question ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, since the riddle distressed me. But he had already touched the earth and disappeared. And the darkness of the night was silent and did not answer me. And my soul stood silently, shaking her head, and did not know what to say about the mystery that ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had indicated and not given away.</p>
<p>{12} Another day passed and the seventh night fell.</p>
<p>And the dead came again, this time with pitiful gestures and said, “We forgot to mention one thing, that we would like you to teach us about men.”</p>
<p>And ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ stepped before me, and began to speak121 (and this is the seventh sermon to the dead)122:</p>
<p>“Man is a gateway, through which you pass from the outer world of Gods, daimons, and souls into the inner world, out of the greater into the smaller world. Small and inane is man, already he is behind you, and once again you find yourselves in endless space, in the smaller or inner infinity.</p>
<p>“At immeasurable distance a lonely star stands in the zenith.</p>
<p>“This is the one God of this one man, this is his world, his Pleroma, his divinity.</p>
<p>“In this world, man is Abraxas, the creator and destroyer of his own world.</p>
<p>“This star is the God and the goal of man.</p>
<p>“This is his one guiding God,</p>
<p>“in him man goes to his rest,</p>
<p>“toward him goes the long journey of the soul after death, in him everything that man withdraws from the greater world shines resplendently.</p>
<p>“To this one God man shall pray.</p>
<p>“Prayer increases the light of the star,</p>
<p>“it throws a bridge across death,</p>
<p>“it prepares life for the smaller world, and assuages the hopeless desires of the greater.</p>
<p>“When the greater world turns cold, the star shines.</p>
<p>“Nothing stands between man and his one God, so long as man can turn away his eyes from the flaming spectacle of Abraxas.</p>
<p>“Man here, God there.</p>
<p>“Weakness and nothingness here, eternally creative power there.</p>
<p>“Here nothing but darkness and clammy cold</p>
<p>there total sun.”123</p>
<p>124But when ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had finished, the dead remained silent. Heaviness fell from them, and they ascended like smoke above the shepherd’s fire, who watches over his flock by night.</p>
<p>But I turned to ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and said, “Illustrious one, you teach that man is a gateway? A gateway through which the procession of the Gods passes? Through which the stream of life flows? Through which the entire future streams into the endlessness of the past?”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered, saying, “These dead believed in the transformation and development of man. They were convinced of human nothingness and transitoriness. Nothing was clearer to them than this, and yet they knew that man even creates its Gods, and so they knew that the Gods were of no use. Therefore they had to learn what they did not know, that man is a gateway through which crowds the train of the Gods and the coming and passing of all times. He does not do it, does not create it, does not suffer it, since he is the being, the sole being, since he is the moment of the world, the eternal moment. Whoever recognizes this stops being flame; he becomes smoke and ashes. He lasts and his transitoriness is over. He has become someone who is. You dreamed of the flame, as if it were life. But life is duration, the flame dies away. I carried that over, I saved it from the fire. That is the son of the fire flower. You saw that in me, I myself am of the eternal fire of light. But I am the one who saved it for you, the black and golden seed and its blue starlight. You eternal being—what is length and brevity? What is the moment and eternal duration? You, being, are eternal in each moment. What is time? Time is the fire that flares up, consumes, and dies down. I saved being from time, redeeming it from the fires of time and the darkness of time, from Gods and devils.”</p>
<p>But I said to him, “Illustrious one, when will you give me the dark and golden treasure and its blue starlight?”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied, “When you have surrendered everything that wants to burn to the holy flame.”125</p>
<p>{13} And as ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ spoke these words, a dark form with golden eyes approached me from the shadows of the night.126 I was startled and cried, “Are you an enemy? Who are you? Where do you come from? I have never seen you before! Speak, what do you want?”</p>
<p>The dark one answered, saying, “I come from afar. I come from the east and follow the shining fire that precedes me, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ. I am not your enemy, I am a stranger to you. My skin is dark and my eyes shine golden.”</p>
<p>“What do you bring?” I asked fearfully.</p>
<p>“I bring abstinence—abstinence from human joy and suffering. Compassion leads to alienation. Pity, but no compassion—pity for the world and a will held in check toward the other.</p>
<p>“Pity remains misunderstood, therefore it works.</p>
<p>“Far from longing, know no fear.</p>
<p>“Far from love, love the whole.”</p>
<p>I looked at him fearfully and said, “Why are you as dark as the earth of the fields and as black as iron? I’m afraid of you; such pain, what have you done to me?”</p>
<p>“You may call me death—death that rose with the sun. I come with quiet pain and long peace. I lay the cover of protection on you. In the midst of life begins death. I lay cover upon cover upon you so that your warmth will never cease.”</p>
<p>“You bring grief and despair,” I answered, “I wanted to be among men.”</p>
<p>But he said, “You will go to men as one veiled. Your light shines at night. Your solar nature departs from you and your stellar nature begins.”</p>
<p>“You are cruel,” I sighed.</p>
<p>“The simple is cruel, it does not unite with the manifold.”</p>
<p>With these words the mysterious dark one vanished. But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ regarded me with a serious and questioning look. “Did you take a proper look at him, my son?” he said. “You will be hearing from him. But come now, so that I can fulfill what the dark one prophesied for you.”</p>
<p>As he spoke these words, he touched my eyes and opened my gaze and showed me the immeasurable mystery. And I looked for a long time until I could grasp it: but what did I see? I saw the night, I saw the dark earth, and above this the sky stood gleaming in the brilliance of countless stars. And I saw that the sky had the form of a woman and sevenfold was her mantle of stars and it completely covered her.</p>
<p>And when I had beheld it, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said:</p>
<p>127“Mother, you who stand in the higher circle, nameless one, who shrouds me and him and protects me and him from the Gods: he wants to become your child.</p>
<p>“May you accept his birth.</p>
<p>“May you renew him. I separate myself from him.128 The cold is growing and its star blazes brighter.</p>
<p>“He needs the bond of childhood.</p>
<p>“You gave birth to the godly serpent, you released it from the pangs of birth; take this man to the abode of the sun, he needs the mother.”</p>
<p>A voice came from afar129 and was like a falling star:</p>
<p>“I cannot take him as a child. He must cleanse himself first.”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said,130 “What is his impurity?”</p>
<p>But the voice said, “It is the commingling: he contains human suffering and joy. He shall remain secluded until abstinence is complete and he is freed from the commingling with men. Then shall he be taken as a child.”</p>
<p>In this moment my vision ended. And ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ went away and I was alone. And I remained apart as I had been told. But in the fourth night I saw a strange form, a man wearing a long coat and a turban; his eyes shone cleverly and kindly like a wise doctor’s.131 He approached me and said, “I speak to you of joy.” But I answered, “You want to speak to me of joy? I bleed from the thousandfold wounds of men.”</p>
<p>He replied, “I bring healing. Women taught me this art. They know how to heal sick children. Do your wounds burn you? Healing is at hand. Give ear to good counsel and do not be incensed.”</p>
<p>I retorted, “What do you want? To tempt me? Mock me?”</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” he interrupted. “I bring you the bliss of paradise, the healing fire, the love of women.”132</p>
<p>“Are you thinking,” I asked, “of the descent into the frog swamp?133 The dissolution in the many, the scattering, the dismembering?”</p>
<p>But as I spoke, the old man turned into ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ,134 and I saw that he was the magician who was tempting me. But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ continued:</p>
<p>“You have not yet experienced the dismembering. You should be blown apart and shredded and scattered to the winds. Men are preparing for the Last Supper with you.”</p>
<p>“What then will remain of me?” I cried.</p>
<p>“Nothing but your shadow. You will be a river that pours forth over the lands. It seeks every valley and streams toward the depths.”</p>
<p>I asked, full of grief, “But where will my uniqueness remain?”</p>
<p>“You will steal it from yourself,” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ replied.135 “You will hold the invisible realm in trembling hands; it lowers its roots into the gray darknesses and mysteries of the earth and sends up branches covered in leaves into the golden air.</p>
<p>“Animals live in its branches.</p>
<p>“Men camp in its shade.</p>
<p>“Their murmuring arises from below.</p>
<p>“A thousand-mile-long disappointment is the juice of the tree.</p>
<p>“It will stay green for a long time.</p>
<p>“Silence abides in its treetop.</p>
<p>“Silence in its deep roots.”</p>
<p>136I gathered from ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ’s words that I must remain true to love to cancel out the commingling that arises through unlived love. I understood that the commingling is a bondage that takes the place of voluntary devotion. Scattering or dismembering arises, as ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had taught me, from voluntary devotion. It cancels out the commingling. Through voluntary devotion I removed binding ties. Therefore I had to remain true to love, and, devoted to it voluntarily, I suffer the dismembering and thus attain bonding with the great mother, that is, the stellar nature, liberation from bondage to men and things. If I am bound to men and things, I can neither go on with my life to its destination nor can I arrive at my very own and deepest nature. Nor can death begin in me as a new life, since I can only fear death. I must therefore remain true to love since how else can I arrive at the scattering and dissolution of bondage? How else could I experience death other than through remaining true to love and willingly accepting the pain and all the suffering? As long as I do not voluntarily devote myself to the dismembering, a part of my self secretly remains with men and things and binds me to them; and thus I must, whether I want to or not, be a part of them, mixed in with them and bound to them. Only fidelity to love and voluntary devotion to love enable this binding and mixing to be dissolved and lead back to me that part of my self that secretly lay with men and things. Only thus does the light of the star grow, only thus do I arrive at my stellar nature, at my truest and innermost self, that simply and singly is.</p>
<p>It is difficult to remain true to love since love stands above all sins. He who wants to remain true to love must also overcome sin. Nothing occurs more readily than failing to recognize that one is committing a sin. Overcoming sin for the sake of remaining true to love is difficult, so difficult that my feet hesitated to advance.</p>
<p>When night fell, ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ approached me in an earth-colored robe, holding a silver fish: “Look, my son,” he said, “I was fishing and caught this fish; I bring it to you, so that you may be comforted.” And as I looked at him astonished and questioningly, I saw that a shade stood in darkness at the door, bearing a robe of grandeur.137 His face was pale and blood had flowed into the furrows of his brow. But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ knelt down, touched the earth, and said to the shade,138 “My master and my brother, praised be your name. You did the greatest thing for us: out of animals you made men, you gave your life for men to enable their healing. Your spirit was with us through an endlessly long time. And men still look to you and still ask you to take pity on them and beg for the mercy of God and the forgiveness of their sins through you. You do not tire of giving to men. I praise your divine patience. Are not men ungrateful? Does their craving know no limits? Do they still make demands on you? They have received so much yet still they are beggars.</p>
<p>“Behold, my master and my brother, they do not love me, but they long for you with greed, for they also crave their neighbor’s possessions. They do not love their neighbor, but they want what is his. If they were faithful to their love, they would not be greedy. But whoever gives, attracts desire. Should they not learn love? Fidelity to love? Freely willed devotion? But they demand and desire and beg from you and have learned no lesson from your awe-inspiring life. They have imitated it, but they have not lived their own lives as you have lived yours. Your awe-inspiring life shows how everyone would have to take their own life into their own hands, faithful to their own essence and their own love. Have you not forgiven the adulteress?139 Did you not sit with whores and tax-collectors?140 Did you not break the command of the Sabbath?141 You lived your own life, but men fail to do so; instead they pray to you and make demands on you and forever remind you that your work is incomplete. Yet your work would be completed if men managed to live their own lives without imitation. Men are still childish and forget gratitude, since they cannot say, Thanks be to you, our lord, for the salvation you have brought us. We have taken it unto ourselves, given it a place in our hearts, and we have learned to carry on your work in ourselves on our own. Through your help we have grown mature in continuing the work of redemption in us. Thanks to you, we have embraced your work, we grasped your redemptive teaching, we completed in ourselves what you had begun for us with bloody struggle. We are not ungrateful children who desire our parents’ possessions. Thanks to you, our master, we will make the most of your talent and will not bury it in the earth and forever stretch out our hands helplessly and urge you to complete your work in us. We want to take your troubles and your work upon ourselves so that your work may be completed and so that you may lay your weary tired hands in your lap, like the worker after a long day’s hard burden. Blessed is the dead one, who rests from the completion of his work.</p>
<p>“I wanted people to address you in this way. But they have no love for you, my master and brother. They begrudge you the price of peace. They leave your work incomplete, eternally needing your pity and your care.</p>
<p>“But, my master and my brother, I believe you have completed your work, since the one who has given his life, his entire truth, all his love, his entire soul, has completed his work. What one individual can do for men, you have done and accomplished and fulfilled. The time has come when each must do his own work of redemption. Mankind has grown older and a new month has begun.”142</p>
<p>143When ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ had finished, I looked up and saw that the place where the shade had stood was empty. I turned to ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and said, “My father, you spoke of men. I am a man. Forgive me!”</p>
<p>But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ dissolved into the darkness and I decided to do what was required of me. I accepted all the joy and every torment of my nature and remained true to my love, to suffer what comes to everyone in their own way. And I stood alone and was afraid.</p>
<p>{14} On a night when everything was silent, I heard a murmur like that of many voices and a bit more clearly I heard the voice of ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ, and it was as if he were giving a speech. And as I listened more closely, I heard his words:</p>
<p>144“Afterward, when I had impregnated the dead body of the underworld, and when it had given birth to the serpent of the God, I went to men and saw the fullness of their affliction and their madness. I saw that they were slaying each other and that they sought the grounds for their actions. They did this because they did not have anything different or better to do. But because they were accustomed to doing nothing for which they could not account, they devised reasons that compelled them to go on killing. Stop, you are out of your minds, said the sage. Stop, for Heaven’s sake, and take stock of what damage you have done, said the canny one. But the fool laughed, since honors had been conferred upon him overnight. Why do men not see their stupidity? Stupidity is a daughter of the God. Therefore men cannot stop murdering, since thus they serve the serpent of the God without knowing it. It is worth giving one’s life for the sake of serving the serpent of the God. Hence be reconciled! But it would be far better to live despite the God. But the serpent of the God wants human blood. This feeds it and makes it shine. Not wanting to murder and die amounts to deceiving the God. Whoever lives has become one who deceives the God. Whoever lives invents his life for himself. But the serpent wants to be deceived, out of hope for blood. The greater the number of men who stole their lives from the Gods, the greater the harvest feeding the serpent from the blood-sown field. The God grows strong through human murder. The serpent grows hot and fiery through the drenching flood. Its fat burns in the blazing flame. The flame becomes the light of men, the first ray of a renewed sun, He, the first appearing light.”</p>
<p>I could not grasp what else ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said. I spent a long time pondering his words, which evidently he had spoken to the dead, and I was horrified by the atrocities that attend the rebirth of a God.</p>
<p>145And soon afterward I saw Elijah and Salome in a dream. Elijah appeared concerned and alarmed. Therefore, when in the following night that light was extinguished and every living sound fell still, I called Elijah and Salome so that they would answer my questions. Elijah came forward and said:</p>
<p>“I have become weak, I am poor, an excess of my power has gone to you, my son. You took too much from me. You went too far away from me. I heard strange and incomprehensible things and the peace of my depths became disturbed.”</p>
<p>I asked, “But what did you hear? What voice did you hear?”</p>
<p>Elijah answered, “I heard a voice full of confusion, an alarmed voice full of warning and the incomprehensible.”</p>
<p>“What did it say,” I asked, “did you hear the words?”</p>
<p>“Indistinctly, it was confused and confusing. The voice spoke first of a knife cutting something or perhaps harvesting, perhaps the grapes that go to the wine press. Perhaps the one wearing the red robe treads the winepress from which the blood flows.146 Thereupon the voice spoke of gold that lies below, and that kills whoever touches it. Then it mentioned fire that burns terribly and that should flare up in our time. And then there was a malicious word, that I would rather not utter.”</p>
<p>“A malicious word? What was it?” I asked.</p>
<p>He answered, “A word about the death of God. There is only one God and God cannot die.”147</p>
<p>Then I replied, “I am astonished, Elijah. Do you not know what happened? Do you not know that the world has put on a new garb? That the one God has gone away, and that in turn many Gods and many daimons have come to man? Truly, I am surprised; I am extremely surprised! How could you not have known? Know you nothing of the new that has come to pass? Yet you know the future! You have foresight! Or maybe you should not know what is? Do you ultimately deny what is?”148</p>
<p>Salome interrupted me: “What is, gives no pleasure. Pleasure comes only from the new. Your soul would also like a new husband—ha ha!—she loves change. You are not pleasurable enough for her. In that respect she is unteachable and therefore you believe she is mad. We love only what is coming, not what is. Only the new gives us pleasure. Elijah does not think about what is, only about what is to come. Therefore he knows it.”</p>
<p>I answered, “What does he know? He should say.”</p>
<p>Elijah said, “I have already uttered the words: the image that I saw was crimson, fiery colored, a gleaming gold. The voice that I heard was like distant thunder, like the wind roaring in the forest, like an earthquake. It was not the voice of my God, but it was a thunderous pagan roar, a call my ancestors knew but which I have never heard. It sounded prehistoric, as if from a forest on a distant coast; it rang with all the voices of the wilderness. It was full of horror yet harmonic.”</p>
<p>To this I replied, “My good old man, you heard correctly, as I thought you had. How wonderful! Shall I tell you about it? After all, I told you that the world has acquired a new face. A new cover was thrown over it. How odd that you don’t know!</p>
<p>“Old Gods have become new. The one God is dead—yes, truly, he died. He disintegrated into the many, and thus the world became rich overnight. And something also happened to the individual soul—who would care to describe it! But therefore men too became rich overnight. How is it possible that you didn’t know this?</p>
<p>“The one God became two, a multiple one, whose body consists of many Gods, and a single one, whose body is a man and yet he is brighter and stronger than the sun.</p>
<p>“What shall I tell you about the soul? Haven’t you noticed that she has become multiple? She has become the closest, nearest, near, far, further, furthest and yet she is one, as before. First she divided herself into a serpent and a bird, then into a father and mother, and then into Elijah and Salome—How are you, my good fellow? Does it disturb you? Yes, you must be realizing that you are already very far removed from me, so that I can hardly reckon you as being part of my soul; since if you belonged to my soul, you would have to know what is happening. Therefore I must separate you and Salome from my soul and place you among the daimons. You are connected to what is primordially old and always exists, therefore you also know nothing of the being of men but simply of the past and future.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless it is good that you came to my call. Take part in that which is. For what is ought to be such that you can take part in it.”</p>
<p>But Elijah sullenly replied, “I do not like this multiplicity. It is not easy to think it.”</p>
<p>And Salome said, “The simple alone is pleasurable. One need not think about it.”</p>
<p>I replied, “Elijah, you need not contemplate it at all. It is not to be thought; it is to be viewed. It is a painting.”</p>
<p>And to Salome I said, “Salome, it is not true that only the simple is pleasurable; over time it is even boring. In truth the multiple captivates you.”</p>
<p>But Salome turned to Elijah and said, “Father, it seems to me that men have outstripped us. He is right: the many is more pleasurable. The one is too simple and always the same.”149</p>
<p>Elijah seemed saddened and said, “What about the one in this case? Does the one still exist if it stands next to the many?”</p>
<p>I answered, “That is your old and ingrained mistake, that the one excludes the many. But there are many individual things. The multiplicity of individual things is the one multiple God from whose body many Gods arise, but the uniqueness of the one thing is the other God, whose body is a man but whose spirit is as large as the world.”</p>
<p>But Elijah shook his head and said, “That is new, my son. Is the new good? What was, is good; and what was, will be. Is that not the truth? Has there ever been anything new? And was what you call new, ever good? Everything remains the same if you give it a new name. There is nothing new, there can be nothing new; how could I then look ahead? I look at the past and therein I see the future, as in a mirror. And I see that nothing new happens, everything is but mere recurrence of what has been since time immemorial.150 What is your being? An appearance, a darting light; tomorrow it is no longer true. It is gone; it is as if it never was. Come, Salome, let us go. One is mistaken in the world of men.”</p>
<p>But Salome looked back and whispered to me while leaving, “Being and multiplicity appeal to me, even if it is not new and not eternally true.”</p>
<p>Thus they disappeared into the dark night and I returned to the burden signified by my existence. And I sought to do everything correctly that seemed to me to be a task and to take every way that seemed to me to be necessary for myself. But my dreams became difficult and laden with anxiety, and I did not know why. One night my soul suddenly came to me, as if worried, and said,151 “Listen to me: I am in a great torment, the son of the dark womb besieges me. Therefore your dreams are also difficult, since you feel the torment of the depths, the pain of your soul, and the suffering of the Gods.”</p>
<p>I answered, “Can I help? Or is it superfluous that a man elevates himself to being a mediator of the Gods? Is it presumption or should a man become a redeemer of the Gods, after men are saved through the divine mediator?”</p>
<p>“You speak the truth,” my soul replied, “the Gods need a human mediator and rescuer. With this man paves the way to crossing over and to divinity. I gave you a frightening dream so that your face would turn to the Gods. I let their torment reach you so that you would remember the suffering Gods. You do too much for men since they are the masters of your world. You can in effect help men only through the Gods, not directly. Alleviate the burning torment of the Gods.”</p>
<p>I asked her, “So tell me, where do I begin? I feel their torment and mine at the same time, and yet it is not mine, both real and unreal.”</p>
<p>“That is it; and this is where separation should occur,” my soul replied.</p>
<p>“But how? My wits fail me. You must know how.”</p>
<p>“Your wits fail quickly,” she retorted, “but the Gods need precisely your human wits.”</p>
<p>“And I the wits of the Gods,” I added; “and thus we run aground.”</p>
<p>“No, you are too impatient; only patient comparison provides a solution, not one side taking a quick decision. It requires work.”</p>
<p>I asked, “What do the Gods suffer from?”</p>
<p>“Well,” my soul replied, “you have left them with torment, and since then they have suffered.”</p>
<p>“Rightly so,” I cried, “they have tormented men enough. Now they should get a taste of it.”</p>
<p>She answered, “But what if the torment also reaches you? What have you gained then? You cannot leave all suffering to the Gods or else they will draw you into their torment. After all, they possess the power to do so. To be sure, I must confess that men too possess a wondrous power over the Gods through their wits.”</p>
<p>I answered, “I recognize that the torment of the Gods reached me; therefore I also recognize that I must yield to the Gods. What is their desire?”</p>
<p>“They want obedience,” she replied.</p>
<p>“So be it,” I answered, “but I fear their desire, therefore I say: I want to do what I can. On no account will I take back onto myself all the torment that I had to leave to the Gods. Not even Christ took torment away from his followers, but rather he heaped it on. I reserve conditions for myself. The Gods should recognize this and direct their desire accordingly. There is no longer any unconditional obedience, since man has stopped being a slave to the Gods. He has dignity before the Gods. He is a limb that even the Gods cannot do without. Giving way before the Gods is no more. So let their wish be heard. Comparison shall accomplish the rest so that each will have his appropriate part.”</p>
<p>My soul answered, “The Gods want you to do for their sake what you know you do not want to do.”</p>
<p>“I thought so,” I exclaimed, “of course that is what the Gods want. But do the Gods also do what I want? I want the fruits of my labor. What do the Gods do for me? They want their goals to be fulfilled, but what about mine?”</p>
<p>This infuriated my soul and she said, “You are unbelievably defiant and rebellious. Consider the fact that the Gods are strong.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I replied, “but no longer is there any unconditional obedience. When will they use their strength for me? They also want me to place mine in their service. What is their payment in kind? That they are tormented? Man suffered agony and the Gods were still not satisfied, but remained insatiable in their devising of new torments. They allowed man to become so blinded that he believed that there were no Gods, and that there was only one God who was a loving father, so that today someone who struggles with the Gods is even thought to be crazy. They have thus prepared this shame too for those who recognize them, out of boundless greed for power, since leading the blind is not easy. They will corrupt even their slaves.”</p>
<p>“You do not want to obey the Gods?” my soul cried, astonished.</p>
<p>I answered, “I believe that has already gone on more than enough. Hence the Gods are insatiable, because they have received too many sacrifices: the altars of blinded humanity are streaming with blood. But dearth makes contentment, not abundance. May they learn dearth from men. Who does something for me? That is the question that I must pose. In no case will I do what the Gods would have to do. Ask the Gods what they think of my suggestion.”</p>
<p>Then my soul divided herself. As a bird she swooped up to the higher Gods and as a serpent she crawled down to the lower Gods. Soon afterward, she returned and said, troubled, “The Gods are outraged that you do not want to be obedient.”</p>
<p>“That bothers me very little,” I replied, “I have done everything to placate the Gods. May they do their share now. Tell them. I can wait. I will let no one tell me what to do. The Gods may devise a service in return. You can go. I will call you tomorrow so that you can tell me what the Gods have decided.”</p>
<p>As my soul departed, I saw that she was shocked and worried, since she belonged to the race of the Gods and daimons and forever sought to convert me to their kind, as my humanity would like to convince me that I belong to the clan and must serve it. When I was asleep, my soul came again and in a dream cunningly painted me as a horned devil to terrify me and make me afraid of myself. In the following night, however, I called my soul and said to her, “Your trick was recognized. It is to no avail. You do not frighten me. Now speak and convey your message!”</p>
<p>She answered, “The Gods give in. You have broken the compulsion of the law. Therefore I painted you as a devil, since he is the only one among the Gods who bows to no compulsion. He is the rebel against the eternal law, to which, thanks to his deed, there are also exceptions. Thus one does not necessarily have to. The devil is helpful in this respect. But it should not happen without seeking counsel from the Gods. This detour is necessary, or else you will fall prey to their law despite the devil.”</p>
<p>Here the soul drew near to my ear and whispered, “The Gods are even happy to turn a blind eye from time to time, since basically they know very well that it would be bad for life if there were no exception to eternal law. Hence their tolerance of the devil.”</p>
<p>She then raised her voice and cried loudly, “The Gods have mercy upon you and have accepted your sacrifice!”</p>
<p>And so the devil helped me to cleanse myself from commingling in bondage, and the pain of one-sidedness pierced my heart and the wound of being torn apart scorched me.</p>
<p>{15}152It was noon on a hot summer’s day and I was taking a stroll in my garden; when I reached the shade of the high trees, I met ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ strolling in the fragrant grass. But when I sought to approach him, a blue shade153 came from the other side, and when ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ saw him, he said, “I find you in the garden, beloved. The sins of the world have conferred beauty upon your countenance.</p>
<p>“The suffering of the world has straightened your shape.</p>
<p>“You are truly a king.</p>
<p>“Your crimson is blood.</p>
<p>“Your ermine is snow from the coldness of the poles.</p>
<p>“Your crown is the heavenly body of the sun, which you bear on your head.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the garden, my master, my beloved, my brother!”</p>
<p>The shade replied, “Oh Simon Magus or whatever your name may be, are you in my garden or am I in yours?”154</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said, “You are, Oh master, in my garden. Helena, or whatever you choose to call her, and I are your servants. You can find accommodation with us. Simon and Helena have become ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ and Baucis and so we are the hosts of the Gods. We granted hospitality to your terrible worm. And since you come forward, we take you in. It is our garden that surrounds you.”155</p>
<p>The shade answered, “Is this garden not mine? Is not the world of the heavens and of the spirits my own?”</p>
<p>ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ said, “You are, Oh master, here in the world of men. Men have changed. They are no longer the slaves and no longer the swindlers of the Gods and no longer mourn in your name, but they grant hospitality to the Gods. The terrible worm156 came before you, whom you recognize as your brother insofar as you are of divine nature, and as your father insofar as you are of human nature.157 You dismissed him when he gave you clever counsel in the desert. You took the counsel, but dismissed the worm: he finds a place with us. But where he is, you will be also.158 When I was Simon, I sought to escape him with the ploy of magic and thus I escaped you. Now that I gave the worm a place in my garden, you come to me.”</p>
<p>The shade answered, “Do I fall for the power of your trick? Have you secretly caught me? Were not deception and lies always your manner?”</p>
<p>But ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered, “Recognize, Oh master and beloved, that your nature is also of the serpent.159 Were you not raised on the tree like the serpent? Have you laid aside your body, like the serpent its skin? Have you not practiced the healing arts, like the serpent? Did you not go to Hell before your ascent? And did you not see your brother there, who was shut away in the abyss?”160</p>
<p>Then the shade said, “You speak the truth. You are not lying. Even so, do you know what I bring you?”</p>
<p>“This I know not,” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered. “I know only one thing, that whoever hosts the worm also needs his brother. What do you bring me, my beautiful guest? Lamentation and abomination were the gift of the worm. What will you give us?”</p>
<p>The shade answered, “I bring you the beauty of suffering. That is what is needed by whoever hosts the worm.”</p>

<p>8.Jung later described the self-criticism depicted in this opening section as the confrontation with the shadow. In 1934 he wrote: “Whoever looks into the mirror of the water will see first of all his own image. Whoever goes to himself risks a confrontation with himself. The mirror does not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it; namely the face we never show to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of the actor. But the mirror lies behind the mask and shows the true face. This confrontation is the first test of courage on the inner way, a test sufficient to frighten off most people, for the meeting with ourselves belongs to the more unpleasant things that can be avoided as long as one can project everything negative into the environment. But if we are able to see our own shadow and can bear knowing about it, then a small part of the problem has already been solved: we have at least brought up the personal unconscious” (“On the archetypes of the collective unconscious,” <em>CW</em> 9, 1, §§43–44).</p>

<p>14.These last two paragraphs do not occur in <em>Black Book</em> 5: In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung wrote: “I think, belief should be replaced by understanding” (<em>CW</em> B, §356). On October 5, 1945, Jung wrote to Victor White: “I began my career with repudiating everything that smelt of belief” (Ann Conrad Lammers and Adrian Cunningham, eds., <em>The Jung-White Letters</em> [Philemon Series, London: Routledge, 2007], p. 6).</p>
<p>15.May 24, 1914. The lines from the beginning of the paragraph do not occur in <em>Black Book</em> 4.</p>

Do I thus not counter the spirit of the time if I dissociate myself from science?” [Soul]: “You are not supposed to dissociate yourself, but consider that science is merely your language.” [I]: “Which depths do you require me to advance to?” [Soul]: “Forever above yourself and the present.” / [I]: “I want to, but what should happen? I often feel I can no longer.” [Soul]: “You must put in extra work. Provide respite. Too many take up your time.” / [I]: “Will this sacrifice arise too?” [Soul]: “You must, you must” (pp. 79–80).</p>

<p>21.<em>Black Book</em> 5 continues: “Ha, this book! I have laid hands on you again—banal and pathological and frantic and divine, my written unconscious! You have forced me to my knees again! Here I am, say what you have to say!” (p. 82). This is the one reference to “the unconscious” in <em>Black Books</em> 2 to 7.</p>
<p>22.June 3, 1915. In the interim, Jung wrote the draft of the preceding books of <em>Liber Novus</em>. On July 28, 1914, Jung gave a talk on “The importance of the unconscious in psychopathology” at a meeting of the British Medical Association in Aberdeen. From around August 9 to around August 22, Jung was on military service in Luzern for 14 days. From around January 1 to around March 8, 1915, Jung was on military service in Olten for 64 days. Between March 10 and 12, he served on the invalid transport (Jung’s military service books, <em>JFA</em>).</p>
<p>23.This sentence is not in <em>Black Book</em> 6.</p>
<p>24.September 14, 1915. In late summer and autumn of 1915, Jung conducted his correspondence with Hans Schmid on the question of psychological types. His concluding letter to Schmid of November 6 indicates a shift that signals a return to the elaboration of his fantasies in the <em>Black Books</em>: “Understanding is a terribly binding power, possibly a veritable soul murder when it levels out vitally important differences. The core of the individual is a mystery of life, which dies when it is ‘grasped.’ That is also why <em>symbols want to keep their secrets</em>, they are mysterious not only because we are unable to clearly see what is at their bottom. . . All understanding as such, being an integration into general viewpoints, contains the devil’s element, and kills. . . That is why, in the later stages of analysis, we must help the other to come to those hidden and un-openable symbols, in which the seed of life lies securely hidden like the tender seed in the hard shell. Actually, there must not be any understanding and agreement on this, even if it were possible, as it were. But if understanding and agreement on this has become generalized and obviously possible, the symbol is ripe for destruction, because it no longer covers the seed, which is about to outgrow the shell. Now I understand a dream I once had, and which greatly impressed me: I was standing in my garden, and I had dug open a rich spring of water which gushed forth mightily. Then I had to dig a trench and a deep hole, in which I collected all the water and let it flow back into the depths of the earth again. In this way salvation is given to us in the un-openable and un-sayable symbol, for it protects us by preventing the devil from swallowing the seed of life” (John Beebe and Ernst Falzeder, eds., <em>The Question of Psychological Types</em>, forthcoming).</p>
<p>25.<em>Black Book</em> 5 continues: “Hermes is your daimon” (p. 87).</p>
<p>26.Jung discussed the alchemical symbolism of gold in <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em> (1955/56, <em>CW</em> 14, §353ff).</p>
<p>27.September 15, 1915.</p>
<p>28.September 17, 1915.</p>
<p>29.In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche wrote: “The Self also seeks with the eyes of sense, it listens too with the ears of the spirit. The Self is always listening and seeking: it compares, subdues, conquers, destroys. It rules and is also the I’s ruler. Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, stands a mighty commander, an unknown sage—he is called Self” (section 1, “Of the despisers of the body,” §1, p. 62). The passage is underlined as in Jung’s copy. There are also lines by the margin and exclamation marks. In commenting on this passage in 1935 in his seminar on <em>Zarathustra</em>, Jung said: “I was already very interested in the concept of the self, but I was not sure how I should understand it. I made my marks when I came across these passages, and they seemed very important to me. . . The concept of the self continued to recommend itself to me. . . I thought that Nietzsche meant a sort of thing-in-itself behind the psychological phenomenon. . . I saw then also that he was producing a concept of the self which was like the Eastern concept; it is an Atman idea” (<em>Nietzsche’s Zarathustra</em>, vol.1, p. 391).</p>
<p>30.In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche wrote: “You crowd together with your neighbours and have beautiful words for it. But I tell you: Your love of your neighbour is your bad love of yourself. You flee away from yourselves and would like to make a virtue of it: but I see through your ‘selflessness’ ” (“Of love of one’s neighbour,” p. 86; as underlined by Jung in his copy).</p>
<p>31.September 18, 1915.</p>
<p>32.In 1941, Jung noted: “The integration or humanization of the self, as has already been indicated, is initiated from the conscious side by making ourselves conscious of our egotistical aims, that means we give an account of our motives and try to form as objective a picture as possible of our own being” (“Transformation symbolism in the mass,” <em>CW</em> 11, §400). This corresponds to the process depicted here in the opening section of <em>Scrutinies</em>.</p>
<p>33.<em>Black Book</em> 5 continues: “which unites Heaven and Hell in itself” (p. 92). Cf. Jung, “Transformation symbolism in the mass” : “The self then functions as a unio oppositorum and thus constitutes the most immediate experience of the divine which is at all psychologically comprehensible” (1941, <em>CW</em> 11, §396).</p>
<p>34.In 1921, Jung wrote concerning the self: “But inasmuch as the I is only the centre of my field of consciousness, it is not identical with the totality of my psyche, being merely one complex among other complexes. I therefore distinguish between the <em>I</em> and the <em>self</em>, since the I is only the subject of my consciousness, while the self is the subject of my total psyche, which also includes the unconscious” (<em>Psychological Types, CW</em> 6, §706). In 1928, Jung described the process of individuation as “self-becoming” and “self-realization” (<em>The Relations between the I and the Unconscious, CW</em> 7, §266). Jung defined the self as the archetype of order, and noted that representations of the self were indistinguishable from God-images (ch. 4, “The self,” <em>Aion: Contributions to the Symbolism of the Self, CW</em> 9, 2). In 1944 he noted that he chose the term because this concept was “on the one hand definite enough to convey the sum of human wholeness and on the other hand indefinite enough to express the indescribable and indeterminate nature of this wholeness. . . in scientific usage the ‘self’ refers neither to Christ nor to the Buddha but to the totality of the figures that are its equivalent, and each of these figures is <em>a symbol of the self</em>” (<em>Psychology and Alchemy, CW</em> 12, §20).</p>
<p>35.The following section is reworked from <em>Black Book</em> 5 in a manner that is hard to separate the layers.</p>
<p>36.In 1929, Jung wrote: “The Gods have become diseases; Zeus no longer rules Olympus but rather the solar plexus and produces curious specimens for the doctor’s consulting room” (“Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower,’ ” CW 13, §54).</p>
<p>37.<em>Black Book</em> 5 continues: “The God has the power, not the self. Powerlessness should thus not be deplored, but it is the condition that should abide. / The God acts from within himself. This should be left to him. What we do to the self, we do to the God. / If we twist the self, we also twist the God. It is divine service to serve oneself. We thus relieve humanity of ourselves. May one man carry another’s burden, has become an immorality. May each carry his own load; that is the least that one can demand anyone to do. We can at best show another how to carry his own load. / To give all one’s goods to the poor means to educate them to become idle. / Pity should not carry another’s load, but it should be a strict educator instead. Solitude with ourselves has no end. It has only just begun” (pp. 92–93).</p>
<p>38.The next four paragraphs do not occur in the <em>Black Books</em>.</p>
<p>39.In Jung’s copy of Eckhart’s <em>Schriften und Predigten</em>, the phrase “that the soul would also have to lose God!” is underlined, and there is a slip of paper on which is written: “Soul must lose God” (Meister Eckhart, <em>Schriften und Predigten. Aus dem Mittelhochdeutschen übersetzt und herausgegeben von Herman Büttner</em>, 2 vols [Eugen Diederichs, 1912], p. 222).</p>

<p>44.Instead of this paragraph, <em>Black Book</em> 5 has: “A phallus?” (p. 95). There is no mention of HAP in <em>Black Book</em> 5. The following references may be connected to this. In <em>The Egyptian Heaven and Hell</em>, Wallis Budge notes that “The Phallus of his Pepi is Hap” (vol. 1, p. 110). He notes that Hap is a son of Horus (p. 491—Jung placed a mark in the margin by this in his copy). He also noted that “In the <em>Book of the Dead</em> these four children of Horus play very prominent parts, and the deceased endeavoured to gain their help and protection at all costs, both by offerings and prayers. . . the four children of Horus shared the protection of the deceased among them, and as far back as the Vth dynasty we find that they presided over his life in the underworld” (Ibid.; underlined as in Jung’s copy) [London: Kegan Paul, Trench and Trubner, 1905]).</p>

Do it, without hesitation. There is no way back, only forward. Your love belongs there. Ridiculous—your love! You must allow death to occur.” [I:] “Leave dead ones around me at least.” [The dead one:] “Enough dead, you are surrounded.” [I:] “I do not notice anything.” [The dead one:] “You ought to notice them.” [I]: “How?

<p>78.On the significance of the <em>Sermones</em> that follow, Jung said to Aniela Jaffé that the discussions with the dead formed the prelude to what he would subsequently communicate to the world, and that their content anticipated his later books. “From that time on, the dead have become ever more distinct for me as the voices of the unanswered, unresolved and unredeemed.” The questions he was required to answer did not come from the world around him, but from the dead. One element that astonished him was the fact that the dead appeared to know no more than they did when they died. One would have assumed that they had attained greater knowledge since death. This explained the tendency of the dead to encroach upon life, and why in China important family events have to be reported to the ancestors. He felt that the dead were waiting for the answers of the living (<em>MP</em>, pp. 258–59; <em>Memories</em>, p. 217). See note 135 (p. 167), above, concerning Christ’s preaching to the dead in Hell.</p>
<p>79.See above, p. 335, where the dead Anabaptists led by Ezechiel were heading to Jerusalem to pray at the holy places.</p>
<p>80.This sentence does not occur in <em>Black Book</em> 5. Concerning the relation of Philemon to the <em>Sermones</em>, Jung told Aniela Jaffé that he grasped Philemon in the <em>Sermones</em>. It was here that Philemon lost his autonomy. (<em>MP</em>, p. 25).</p>
<p>81.Jung’s calligraphic and printed versions of the <em>Sermones</em> bear the subheading: “The seven instructions of the dead. Written by Basilides in Alexandria, where the East touches the West. Translated from the original Greek text into the German language.” Basilides was a Christian philosopher in Alexandria in the first part of the second century. Little is known about his life, and only fragments of his teachings have survived (and none in his own hand), which present a cosmogonic myth. For the extant fragments and commentary, see Bentley Layton ed., <em>The Gnostic Scriptures</em> (New York: Doubleday, 1987, pp. 417–44). According to Charles King, Basilides was by birth an Egyptian. Before his conversion to Christianity, he “followed the doctrines of Oriental Gnosis, and endeavoured. . . to combine the tenets of the Christian religion with the Gnostic philosophy. . . For this purpose he chose expressions of his own invention, and ingenious symbols” (<em>The Gnostics and their Remains</em> [Bell and Daldy, 1864], pp. 33–34). According to Layton, the classical Gnostic myth has the following structure: “Act I. The expansion of a solitary first principle (god) into a full nonphysical (spiritual) universe. Act II. Creation of the material universe, including stars, planets, earth, and hell. Act III. Creation of Adam, Eve, and their children. Act IV. Subsequent history of the human race” (<em>The Gnostic Scriptures</em>, p. 13). Thus in its broadest outlines, Jung’s <em>Sermones</em> is presented in the form analogous to a Gnostic myth. Jung discusses Basilides in <em>Aion</em> (1951). He credits the Gnostics for having found suitable symbolic expressions of the self, and notes that Basilides and Valentinus “allowed themselves to be influenced in a large measure by natural inner experience. They therefore provide, like the alchemists, a veritable mine of information concerning all those symbols arising out of the repercussions of the Christian message. At the same time, their ideas compensate the aysmmetry of God postulated by the doctrine of the <em>privato boni</em>, exactly like those well-known modern tendencies of the unconscious to produce symbols of totality for bridging the gap between consciousness and the unconscious” (<em>CW</em> 9, 2, §428). In 1915, he wrote a letter to a friend from his student days, Rudolf Lichtenhan, who had written a book, <em>Die Offenbarung im Gnosticismus</em> (1901). From Lichtenhan’s reply dated November 11, it appears that Jung had asked for information concerning the conception of different human characters in Gnosticism, and their possible correlation with William James’s distinction between tough- and tender-minded characters (<em>JA</em>). In <em>Memories</em>, Jung said: “Between 1918 and 1926 I had seriously studied the Gnostics, for they too had been confronted with the primal world of the unconscious. They had dealt with its contents and images, which were obviously contaminated with the world of drives” (p. 226). Jung was already reading Gnostic literature in the course of the preparatory reading for <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em>. There has been an extensive body of commentaries concerning the <em>Septem Sermones</em>, which provides some valuable discussion. However, these should be treated cautiously, as they considered the <em>Sermones</em> without the benefit of <em>Liber Novus</em> and the <em>Black Books</em>, and, not least, Philemon’s commentaries, which together provide critical contextual clarification. Scholars have discussed Jung’s relation to Gnosticism and the historical Basilides, other possible sources and parallels for <em>Sermones</em>, and the relation of the <em>Sermones</em> to Jung’s later works. See especially Christine Maillard, <em>Les Septem Sermones aux Morts de Carl Gustav Jung</em> (Nancy: Presses Universitaires de Nancy, 1993). See also Alfred Ribi, <em>The Search for the Roots: C. G. Jung and the Tradition of Gnosis</em>, Foreword by Lance Owens, tr. Don Reveau (Los Angeles: Gnosis Archive Books, 2013).

<p>82.The Pleroma, or fullness, is a term from Gnosticism. It played a central role in the Valentinian system. Hans Jonas states that “Pleroma is the standard term for the fully explicated manifold of divine characteristics, whose standard number is thirty, forming a hierarchy and together constituting the divine realm” (<em>The Gnostic Religion: The Message of the Alien God and the Beginnings of Christianity</em> [London: Routledge, 1992], p. 180). In 1929, Jung said: “The Gnostics. . . expressed it as Pleroma, a state of fullness where the pairs of opposites, yea and nay, day and night, are together, then when they ‘become,’ it is either day or night. In the state of ‘promise’ before they become, they are nonexistent, there is neither white nor black, good nor bad” (<em>Dream Analysis: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1928–1930</em>, ed. William McGuire [Bollingen Series, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984], p. 131). In his later writings, Jung used the term to designate a state of pre-existence and potentiality, identifying it with the Tibetan Bardo: “He must. . . accustom himself to the idea that ‘time’ is a relative concept and needs to be compensated by the concept of a ‘simultaneous’ Bardo—or pleromatic existence of all historical processes. What exists in the Pleroma as an eternal ‘process’ appears in time as aperiodic sequence, that is to say, it is repeated many times in an irregular pattern” (<em>Answer to Job</em>, 1952, <em>CW</em> 11, §629; see also §§620, 624, 675, 686, 727, 733, 748). The distinction that Jung draws between the Pleroma and the creation has some points of contact with Meister Eckhart’s differentiation between the Godhead and God. Jung commented on this in <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921, <em>CW</em> 6, §429f). The relation of Jung’s Pleroma to Eckhart is discussed by Maillard, <em>op cit</em>., pp. 118–20. In 1955/56, Jung equated the Pleroma with the alchemist Gerhardus Dorn’s notion of the ‘unus mundus’ (one world) (<em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em>, <em>CW</em> 14, §660). Jung adopted this expression to designate the transcendental postulate of the unity underlying the multiplicity of the empirical world (Ibid., §759f.).</p>
<p>83.In <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), Jung described “Tao” as “the creative being, begetting as the father and bringing forth as the mother. It is the beginning and end of all beings” (<em>CW</em> 6, §363.) The relation of Jung’s Pleroma to the Chinese Tao is discussed by Maillard, <em>op cit</em>., p. 75. See also John Peck, <em>The Visio Dorothei: Desert Context, Imperial Setting, Later Alignments</em>, pp. 179–80.</p>
<p>84.Lit. <em>Unterschiedenheit.</em> Cf. <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), <em>CW</em> 6, §705, “Differentiation” [<em>Differenzierung</em>].</p>
<p>85.The principium individuationis is a notion from the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. He defined space and time as the principium individuationis, noting that he had borrowed the expression from Scholasticism. The principium individuationis was the possibility of multiplicity (<em>The World as Will and Representation</em> [1819], 2 vols., tr. E. J. Payne [New York: Dover], pp. 145–46). The term was used by Eduard von Hartmann, who saw its origin in the unconscious. It designated the “uniqueness” of each individual set against the “all-one unconscious” (<em>Philosophie des Unbewussten: Versuch einer Weltanschauung</em> [Berlin: C. Dunker], 1869, p. 519). In 1912, Jung wrote, “Diversity arises from individuation. This fact validates an essential part of Schopenhauer’s and Hartmann’s philosophy in profound psychological terms” (<em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido, CW</em> B, §289). In a series of papers and presentations later in 1916, Jung developed his concept of individuation (“The structure of the unconscious,” <em>CW</em> 7, and “Individuation and collectivity,” <em>CW</em> 18). In 1921, Jung defined it as follows: “The concept of individuation plays no minor role in our psychology. Individuation is in general the process of the formation and particularization of individual beings; especially the development of the psychological individual, as a being distinct from generality, from collective psychology. Individuation, therefore, is a process of differentiation, having for its goal the development of the individual personality” (<em>Psychological Types</em>, <em>CW</em> 7, §758).</p>
<p>86.The notion of life and nature being constituted by opposites and polarities featured centrally in the <em>Naturphilosophie</em> of Schelling. The notion that psychic conflict took the form of a conflict of opposites and that healing represented their resolution featured prominently in Jung’s later work; see <em>Psychological Types</em>, 1921, <em>CW</em> 6, ch. 5, and <em>Mysterium Coniunctionis</em>, 1955/56, <em>CW</em> 14.</p>
<p>87.The following paragraphs to the end of this section do not occur in <em>Black Book</em> 6.</p>
<p>88.In the published version of the <em>Sermones</em>, these commentaries that follow each sermon do not appear, and nor does Philemon. The person delivering the sermons has been assumed to be Basilides. These commentaries were added in <em>Scrutinies</em>.</p>
<p>89.In his 1959 BBC TV interview, John Freeman asked Jung, “Do you now believe in God?” Jung replied: “Now? [Pause.] Difficult to answer. I <em>know</em>. I don’t need to believe. I know.” William McGuire and R.F.C. Hull, eds., C. G. <em>Jung Speaking: Interviews and Encounters</em> (p. 428). Philemon’s statement here seems to be the background for this much cited and debated statement. This emphasis on direct experience also accords with classical Gnosticism.</p>

<p>91.For Nietzsche’s discussion of the death of God, see <em>The Gay Science</em> (1882, §§108 and 125), and <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, section 4 (“Retired from service,” p. 271f). For Jung’s discussion of this, see “Psychology and religion,” 1938, <em>CW</em> 11 §142f. Jung commented: “When Nietzsche said: ‘God is dead,’ he expressed a truth which is valid for the greater part of Europe” (Ibid., §145). To Nietzsche’s statement, Jung noted, “However it would be more correct to say: ‘He has discarded our image, and where will we find him again?’ ” (Ibid.) He goes on to discuss the motif of the death and disappearance of God in connection with Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<p>92.Cf. “Attempt at a psychological interpretation of the dogma of the Trinity” (1940), <em>CW</em> 11, §284f.</p>
<p>93.In 1932, Jung commented on Abraxas: “the Gnostic symbol Abraxas, a made-up name meaning three hundred and sixty-five. . . the Gnostics used it as the name of their supreme deity. He was a time god. The philosophy of Bergson, <em>la durée créatrice</em>, is an expression of the same idea.” Jung described him in a way that echoes his description here: “just as this archetypal world of the collective unconscious is exceedingly paradoxical, always yea and nay, that figure of Abraxas means the beginning and the end, it is life and death, therefore it is represented by a monstrous figure. It is a monster because it is the life of vegetation in the course of one year, the spring and the autumn, the summer and the winter, the yea and nay of nature. So Abraxas is really identical with the Demiurgos, the world creator. And as such he is surely identical with the Purusha, or with Shiva” (November 16, <em>Visions Seminar</em>, vol. 2, pp. 806–7). Jung added that “Abraxas is usually represented with the head of a fowl, the body of a man, and the tail of a serpent, but there is also the lion-headed symbol with a dragon’s body, the head crowned with the twelve rays, alluding to the number of months” (June 7, 1933, <em>Visions Seminar</em>, vol. 2, p. 1041–42). According to St. Irenaeus, Basilides held that “the ruler of them is named Abrasaks, and that is why this (ruler) has the number 365 within it” (Layton, ed., <em>The Gnostic Scriptures,</em> p. 425). Abraxas featured in Albrecht Dieterich’s work <em>Abraxas. Studien zur Religionsgeschichte des spätern Altertums</em>. Jung studied this work closely early in 1913, and his copy is annotated. Jung also had a copy of Charles King’s <em>The Gnostics and their Remains</em> (London: Bell and Daldy, 1864), and there are marginal annotations next to the passage discussing the etymology of Abraxas on p. 37.</p>
<p>94.Helios is the Greek Sun God. Jung discussed solar mythologies in <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912, <em>CW</em> B, §177f) and also in his unpublished concluding talk on Opicinus de Canistris at the Eranos conference in Ascona in 1943 (<em>JA</em>).</p>

<p>98.This sentence does not occur in <em>Black Book</em> 6.</p>
<p>99.Aristotle defined happiness as the supreme good (Summum Bonum). In his <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Thomas Aquinas identified this with God. Jung saw the doctrine of the Summum Bonum as being the source of the concept of the <em>privatio boni</em>, which in his view had led to the denial of the reality of evil. See <em>Aion</em>, 1951, <em>CW</em> 9, 2, §§80 and 94. Hence it is counterbalanced here with the “Infinum Malum.”</p>
<p>100.In <em>Black Book</em> 6 (see Appendix C), Jung notes that Abraxas is the God of the frogs and that “The God of the frogs or toads, the brainless one, is the union of the Christian God with Satan” (see below, p. 579). In his later writings, Jung argued that the Christian God image was one-sided, in that it left out the factor of evil. Through studying the historical transformations of God-images, he attempted to correct this (especially, <em>Aion</em> and <em>Answer to Job</em>). In his note on how <em>Answer to Job</em> came to be written he wrote that in <em>Aion</em> he had “criticized the idea of the <em>privatio boni</em> as not agreeing with the psychological findings. Psychological experience shows us that whatever we call ‘good’ is balanced by an equally substantial ‘bad’ or ‘evil.’ If ‘evil’ is non-existent, then whatever there is must needs be ‘good.’ Dogmatically, neither ‘good’ nor ‘evil’ can be derived from Man, since the ‘Evil One’ existed before Man as one of the ‘Sons of God.’ The idea of the privatio boni began to play a role in the Church only after Mani. Before this heresy, Clement of Rome taught that God rules the world with a right and a left hand, the right being Christ, the left being Satan. Clement’s view is clearly monotheistic, as it unites the opposites in one God. Later Christianity, however, is dualistic, inasmuch as it splits off one half of the opposites, personified in Satan. . . If Christianity claims to be a <em>monotheism</em>, it becomes unavoidable to assume the opposites as being contained in God” (1956, <em>CW</em> 11, pp. 357–58).</p>
<p>101.In 1942, Jung noted: “the concept of an all-encompassing God must necessarily include his opposite. The coincidence of course must not be too radical, otherwise God would cancel himself out. The principle of the coincidence of opposites must therefore be completed by its opposite in order to attain full paradoxicality and hence psychological validity” (“The spirit Mercurius,” <em>CW</em> 13, §256).</p>

<p>103.February 3, 1916. This sentence does not occur in <em>Black Book</em> 6.</p>
<p>104.In 1917, Jung wrote a chapter on “the sexual theory” in <em>The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes</em>, which presented a critique of the psychoanalytic understanding of the erotic. In his 1928 revision of this chapter, retitled “The Eros theory” he added: “The Erotic. . . belongs on the one hand to the original drive nature of man. . . On the other hand it is related to the highest forms of the spirit. It only thrives when spirit and drive are in right harmony. . . ‘Eros is a mighty daemon,’ as the wise Diotima said to Socrates. . . He is not all of nature within us, though he is at least one of its essential aspects” (<em>CW</em> 7, §§32–33). In the <em>Symposium</em>, Diotima teaches Socrates about the nature of Eros. She tells him that “ ‘He is a great spirit, Socrates. Everything classed as a spirit falls between god and human.’ / ‘What function do they have?’ I asked. / ‘They interpret and carry messages from humans to gods and from gods to humans. They convey prayers and sacrifices from humans, and commands and gifts in return for sacrifices from gods. Being intermediate between the other two, they fill the gap between them, and enable the universe to form an interconnected whole. They serve as the medium for all divination, for priestly expertise in sacrifice, ritual and spells, and for all prophecy and sorcery. Gods do not make direct contact with humans; they communicate and converse with humans (whether awake or asleep) entirely through the medium of spirits’ ” (tr. C. Gill [London: Penguin, 1999], pp. 202e–203a. In <em>Memories</em> Jung reflected on the nature of Eros, describing it as “a <em>kosmogonos</em>, a creator and father-mother of all consciousness” (p. 387). This cosmogonic characterization of Eros needs to be distinguished from Jung’s use of the term to characterize women’s consciousness. See note 161, p. 177.</p>

<p>113.Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> ends with a vision of the Mater Gloriosa. In his lecture, “Faust and alchemy,” Jung said of this: “The Mater Coelestis should on no account be thought of as Mary or the Church. She is rather Aphrodite urania, as in St. Augustine or Pico de Mirandola, the beatissima mater” (in Irene Gerber-Münch, <em>Goethes Faust: Eine tiefenpsychologische Studie über den Mythos des modernen Menschen.

<p>115.In <em>Transformations and Symbols of the Libido</em> (1912), Jung noted: “The phallus is the creature that moves without limbs, sees without eyes, and knows the future; and as the symbolic representative of ubiquitous creative power it claims immortality” (<em>CW</em> B, §209). He goes on to discuss phallic Gods.</p>

<p>123.On February 29, 1919, Jung wrote a letter to Joan Corrie and commented on the <em>Sermones</em>, with particular reference to the last one: “The primordial creator of the world, the blind creative libido, becomes transformed in man through individuation &amp; out of this process, which is like pregnancy, arises a divine child, a reborn God, no more (longer) dispersed into the millions of creatures, but being one &amp; this individual, and at the same time all individuals, the same in you as in me. Dr. L[ong] has a little book: VII sermones ad mortuous. There you find the description of the Creator dispersed into his creatures, &amp; in the last sermon you find the beginning of individuation, out of which, the divine child arises. . . The child is a new God, actually born in many individuals, but they don’t know it. He is a spiritual God. A spirit in many people, yet one and the same everywhere. Keep to your time and you will experience His qualities” (Copied in Constance Long’s diary, Countway Library of Medicine, pp. 21–22).</p>

<p>125.In September 1916, Jung had conversations with his soul that provided further elaboration and clarification of the cosmology of the <em>Sermones</em>. September 25: [Soul]: “How many lights do you want, three or seven? Three is the heartfelt and modest, seven the general and encompassing.” [I:] “What a question! And what a decision! I must be true: I think I would like seven lights.” [Soul:] “Seven, you say? I thought so. That has broad scope—cold lights.” [I:] “I need cooling, fresh air. Enough of this stifling mugginess. Too much fear and not enough free breathing. Give me seven lights.” [Soul:] “The first light means the Pleroma. / The second means Abraxas. / The third the sun. / The fourth the moon. / The fifth the earth. / The sixth the phallus. / The seventh the stars.” [I:] “Why were there no birds, and why were the celestial mother and the sky missing?” [Soul:] “They are all enclosed in the star. As you look at the star, you look through them. They are the bridges to the star. They form the seventh light, the highest, the floating, which rises with flapping wings, released from the embrace of the tree of light with six branches and one blossom, in which the God of the star lay slumbering. / The six lights are single and form a multiplicity; the one light is one and forms a unity; it is the blossoming crown of the tree, the holy egg, the seed of the world endowed with wings so it can reach its place. The one gives rise to the many over and again, and the many entails the one” (<em>Black Book</em> 6, pp. 104–6). September 28: [Soul:] “Now let us try this: it is something of the golden bird. It is not the white bird, but the golden one. It is different. The white bird is a good daimon, but the golden one is above you and under your God. It flies ahead of you. I see it in the blue ether, flying toward the star. It is something that is part of you. And it is at once its own egg, containing you. Do you feel me. Then ask!” [I] “Tell me more. It makes me feel queasy.” [Soul:] “The golden bird is no soul; it is your entire nature. People are golden birds as well; not all; some are worms and rot in the earth. But many are also golden birds.” [I]: “Continue, I fear my revulsion. Tell me what you have grasped.” [Soul:] “The golden bird sits in the tree of the six lights. The tree grows out of Abraxas’s head, but Abraxas grows out of the Pleroma. Everything from which the tree grows blossoms as a light, transformed, as a womb of the flowering treetop, of the golden egg-bird. The tree of light is first a plant, which is called an individual; this grows out of Abraxas’s head, his thought is one among many. The individual is a mere plant without flowers and fruits, a passageway to the tree of seven lights. The individual is a precursor of the tree of light. The lucent blossoms from him, Phanes himself, Agni, a new fire, a golden bird. This comes after the individual, namely when it has been reunited with the world, the world blossoms from it. Abraxas is the drive, individual, distinct from him, but the tree of the seven lights is the symbol of the individual united with Abraxas. This is where Phanes appears and he, the golden bird, flies ahead. / You unite yourself with Abraxas through me. / First you give me your heart, and then you live through me. I am the bridge to Abraxas. Thus the tree of light arises in you and you become the tree of light and Phanes arises from you. You have anticipated, but not understood this. At the time you had to separate from Abraxas to become individual, opposed to the drive. Now you become one with Abraxas. This happens through me. You cannot do this. Therefore you must remain with me. Unification with the physical Abraxas occurs through the human female, but that with the spiritual Abr. occurs through me; that is why you must be with me” (<em>Black Book</em> 6, pp. 114–20).</p>

Then they receded, but after about two years they reappeared. To my complete astonishment, they were completely unchanged; they spoke and acted as if nothing had happened in the meanwhile. In actuality the most incredible things had taken place in my life. I had, as it were, to begin from the beginning again, to tell them all about what had been going on, and explain things to them. At the time I had been greatly surprised by this situation. Only later did I understand what had happened: in the interval the two had sunk back into the unconscious and into themselves—I might equally put, into timelessness. They remained out of contact with the I and the I’s changing circumstances, and therefore were ‘ignorant’ of what had happened in the world of consciousness” (pp. 338–39).

Further accounts of him are found in the apocryphal acts of Peter, and in writings of the Church fathers. He has been seen as one of the founders of Gnosticism, and in the second century a Simonian sect arose. He is said to have always traveled with a woman, whom he found in a brothel in Tyre, who was the reincarnation of Helen of Troy. Jung cited this as an example of the anima figure (“Soul and earth,” 1927, <em>CW</em> 10, §75). On Simon Magus, see Gilles Quispel, <em>Gnosis als Weltreligion</em> (Zürich: Origo Verlag, 1951), pp. 51–70, and G.R.S.

<p>155.In <em>Memories</em>, Jung commented: “In such dream wandering one frequently encounters an old man who is accompanied by a young girl, and examples of such couples are to be found in many mythic tales. Thus, according to Gnostic tradition, Simon Magus went about with a young girl whom he had picked up in a brothel. Her name was Helen, and she was regarded as the reincarnation of the Trojan Helen.

<p>Epilogue1</p>
<p>1959</p>
<p>I worked on this book for 16 years. My acquaintance with alchemy in 1930 took me away from it. The beginning of the end came in 1928, when Wilhelm sent me the text of the “Golden Flower,” an alchemical treatise. There the contents of this book found their way into actuality and I could no longer continue working on it. To the superficial observer, it will appear like madness. It would also have developed into one, had I not been able to absorb the overpowering force of the original experiences. With the help of alchemy, I could finally arrange them into a whole. I always knew that these experiences contained something precious, and therefore I knew of nothing better than to write them down in a “precious,” that is to say costly, book and to paint the images that emerged through reliving it all—as well as I could. I knew how frightfully inadequate this undertaking was, but despite much work and many distractions I remained true to it, even if another / possibility never. ..</p>

<p><em>Opposite:</em> <em>Systema Munditotius</em>. (30 cm x 34 cm) In 1955, Jung’s <em>Systema Munditotius</em> was published anonymously in a special issue of <em>Du</em> dedicated to the Eranos conferences. In a letter of February 11, 1955, to Walter Corti, Jung explicitly stated that he did not want his name to appear with it (JA). He added the following comments to it: “It portrays the antinomies of the microcosm within the macrocosmic world and its antinomies. At the very top, the figure of the young boy in the winged egg, called Erikapaios or Phanes and thus reminiscent as a spiritual figure of the Orphic Gods. His dark antithesis in the depths is here designated as Abraxas. He represents the <em>dominus mundi</em>, the lord of the physical world, and is a world-creator of an ambivalent nature. Sprouting from him we see the tree of life, labeled <em>vita</em> (‘life’) while its upper counterpart is a light-tree in the form of a seven-branched candelabra labeled <em>ignis</em> (‘fire’) and <em>Eros</em> (‘love’). Its light points to the spiritual world of the divine child. Art and science also belong to this spiritual realm, the first represented as a winged serpent and the second as a winged mouse (as hole-digging activity!).—The candelabra is based on the principle of the spiritual number three (twice-three flames with one large flame in the middle), while the lower world of Abraxas is characterized by five, the number of natural man (the twice-five rays of his star). The accompanying animals of the natural world are a devilish monster and a larva. This signifies death and rebirth. A further division of the mandala is horizontal. To the left we see a circle indicating the body or the blood, and from it rears the serpent, which winds itself around the phallus, as the generative principle. The serpent is dark and light, signifying the dark realm of the earth, the moon, and the void (therefore called Satanas). The light realm of rich fullness lies to the right, where from the bright circle <em>frigus sive amor dei</em> [cold, or the love of God] the dove of the Holy Ghost takes wing, and wisdom (<em>Sophia</em>) pours from a double beaker to left and right.—This feminine sphere is that of heaven.—The large sphere characterized by zigzag lines or rays represents an inner sun; within this sphere the macrocosm is repeated, but with the upper and lower regions reversed as in a mirror. These repetitions should be conceived of as endless in number, growing even smaller until the innermost core, the actual microcosm, is reached.” Copyright © The Foundation of the Works of C. G.

<p>Appendix B Commentaries</p>
<p><em>pp. 86–89</em>1</p>
<p>Age</p>
<p>Male</p>
<p>Enantiodromia of the life-type</p>
<p>It is difficult to force this image to make a statement. Yet it is so allegorical that it ought to speak. It differs from the earlier experiences in that it is more witnessed than experienced. For that matter, all the images that I have placed under the title “Mystery play” are rather more allegorical than actual experiences. They are certainly not intended allegories; they have not been consciously contrived to depict experience in either veiled or even fantastic terms. Rather, they appeared as visions. It was not until I reworked them later that I realized more and more that they could in no way be compared with the experiences portrayed in the other chapters. These images apparently are portrayals of personified unconscious thoughts. That follows from their imagistic manner. They also called for more reflection and interpretation than the other experiences, to which I could not do justice with cogitation, because they were quite simply experiences. The images of the “Mystery play,” on the other hand, personify principles accessible to thinking and intellectual understanding, and their allegorical manner accordingly also invites such an attempt at explanation.</p>
<p>The action is set in a dark earthly depth, evidently an allegorical representation of the inner depths beneath the extension of the bright space of consciousness or the psychic field of vision. Sinking into such a depth corresponds to averting the mental gaze from outer things and focusing it on the inner dark depths. Gazing at the darkness to some extent animates the previously dark background. Since gazing at the darkness occurs without conscious expectation, the inanimate psychic background has an opportunity to let its contents appear, undisturbed by conscious assumptions.</p>
<p>The preceding experiences indicated that strong psychic movements were present that consciousness could not grasp. Two figures—the old sage and the young maiden—step into the field of vision, unexpectedly for consciousness, but characteristic of the mythological spirit upon which consciousness rests. This configuration is an image that forever recurs in the human spirit. The old man represents a spiritual principle that could be designated as Logos, and the maiden represents an unspiritual principle of feeling that could be called Eros. A descendent of Logos is Nous, the intellect, which has done away with the commingling of feeling, presentiment, and sensation. In contrast, the Logos contains this commingling. But it is not the product of such blending, or else it would be a lower animalistic psychic activity, yet it masters the blend, so that the four fundamental activities of the soul become subordinate to its principle. It is an independent principle of form that means understanding, insight, foresight, legislation, and wisdom. The figure of an old prophet is therefore a fitting allegory for this principle, since the prophetic spirit unites in itself all these qualities. In contrast, Eros is a principle that contains a commingling of all the fundamental activities of the soul just as much as it masters them, although its purpose is completely different. It is not form-giving but form-fulfilling; it is the wine that will be poured into the vessel; it is not the bed and direction of the stream but the impetuous water flowing in it. Eros is desire, longing, force, exuberance, pleasure, suffering. Where Logos is ordering and insistence, Eros is dissolution and movement. They are two fundamental psychic powers that form a pair of opposites, each one requiring the other.</p>
<p>The old prophet expresses persistence, but the young maiden denotes movement. Their impersonal essence is expressed by the fact that they are figures belonging to general human history; they do not belong to a person but have been a spiritual content of the world’s peoples since time immemorial. Everyone has them, and therefore these figures recur in the work of thinkers and poets.</p>
<p>Such primordial images have a secret power that works just as much on human reason as on the soul. Wherever they appear they stir something linked with the mysterious, the long gone, and heavy with foreboding. A string sounds whose vibration reverberates in every man’s breast; these primordial images dwell in everyone as they are the property of all mankind.2 This secret power is like a spell, like magic, and causes elevation just as much as seduction. It is characteristic of primordial images that they take hold of man where he is utterly human, and a power seizes him, as if the bustling throng were pushing him. And this happens even if individual understanding and feeling rise up against it. What is the power of the individual against the voice of the whole people in him? He is entranced, possessed, and consumed. Nothing makes this effect clearer than the serpent. It signifies everything dangerous and everything bad, everything nocturnal and uncanny, which adheres to Logos as well as to Eros, so long as they can work as the dark and unrecognized principles of the unconscious spirit.</p>
<p>The house represents a fixed abode, which indicates that Logos and Eros have permanent residence in us.</p>
<p>Salome is represented as the daughter of Elijah, thus expressing the order of succession. The prophet is her producer, she emanates from him. The fact that she is assigned to him as a daughter indicates a subordination of Eros to Logos. Although this relation is very frequent, as manifested by the constancy of this primordial image, it is nevertheless a special case that possesses no general validity. For if these were two opposed principles, one could not arise from the other and thus depend on it. Salome is hence apparently no (complete) correct embodiment of Eros, but a variety of the same. (This supposition is later confirmed.) That she is actually an incorrect allegory for Eros also stems from the fact that she is blind. Eros is not blind, since he regulates, just as well as Logos does, all fundamental activities of the soul. The blindness indicates her incompleteness and the absence of an essential quality. By virtue of her shortcoming she depends upon her father.</p>
<p>The indistinct glittering walls of the hall point to something unrecognized, perhaps something valuable that wakens curiosity and attracts attention. In this manner, creative involvement is woven even deeper into the image, so that an even greater animation of the dark background becomes possible. Such enhanced attention gives rise to the image of an object, which to all intents and purposes expresses concentration, namely the image of a crystal, which has been used to produce such visions since time immemorial. These figures, which at first are incomprehensible to the beholder, evoke dark processes in his soul, which to a certain extent lie even deeper (such as in the vision of blood), and whose perception requires an aid like the crystal. As has been said, however, this expresses nothing else than an even stronger concentration of creative attention.</p>
<p>A figure like the prophet, which is clear and complete in itself, arouses less curiosity than the unexpected form of blind Salome, which is why one may expect that the formative process will first address the problem of Eros. Hence an image of Eve appears first, together with images of the tree and the serpent. This apparently refers to temptation, as already encapsulated in the figure of Salome. Temptation brings about a further movement toward the side of Eros. This in turn forebodes many adventurous possibilities, for which the wandering of Odysseus is the fitting image. This image stimulates and invites adventurousness; it is as if a door opened to a new opportunity to free the gaze from the dark confinement and depths in which it was held fast. Hence the vision opens onto a sunny garden, whose red blooming trees represent a development of erotic feeling, and whose wells mean a steady source. The cool water of the well, which does not inebriate, indicates the Logos. (Therefore Salome also speaks later of the deep “wells” of the prophet.) This suggests that the development of Eros also means a source of knowledge. And with this Elijah begins to speak.</p>
<p>Logos undoubtedly has the upper hand in this, my case, since Elijah says that he and his daughter have always been one. Yet Logos and Eros are not one, but two. In this case, however, Logos has blinded and subjugated Eros. But if this is the case, then the necessity will also arise to free Eros from the clutch of Logos, so that the former will regain vision. Therefore Salome turns to me, because Eros is in need of help, and because I have apparently been enabled to behold this image for precisely this reason. The soul of the man is more inclined to Logos than to Eros, which is more characteristic of the essence of the woman. The subjugation of Eros through Logos explains not only the blindness of Eros but also the somewhat strange fact that Eros is represented precisely by the not-so-pleasing figure of Salome. Salome denotes bad qualities. She brings to mind not only the murder of the holy one but also the incestuous pleasure of the father.</p>
<p>A principle always has the dignity of independence. But if this dignity is taken from it, it is debased and then assumes a bad form. We know that psychic activity and qualities that are deprived of development through repression degenerate and thus become bad habits. Either an open or secret vice takes the place of a well-formed activity and gives rise to a disunity of the personality with itself, signifying a moral suffering or a real sickness. Only one way remains open to whoever wants to free himself from this suffering: he must accept the repressed part of his soul, he must love his inferiority, even his vices, so that what is degenerate can resume development.</p>
<p>Wherever Logos rules, there is order but too much persistence. The allegory of paradise where there is no struggle and therefore no development is fitting here. In this condition the repressed movement degenerates and its value is lost. This is the murder of the holy one, and the murder happens because, like Herod, Logos cannot protect the holy one on account of his own weakness, because he can do nothing else than hold onto himself, thus inducing the degeneration of Eros. Only disobedience against the ruling principle leads out of this condition of undeveloped persistence. The story of paradise repeats itself, and hence the serpent winds its way up the tree because Adam should be led into temptation.</p>
<p>Every development leads through the undeveloped, but capable of development. In its undeveloped condition it is almost worthless, while development represents a highest value that is unquestionable. One must give up this value or at least apparently give it up to be able to attend to the undeveloped. But this stands in the sharpest contrast to the developed, which perhaps represents our best and highest achievement. The acceptance of the undeveloped is therefore like a sin, like a false step, a degeneration, a descent to a deeper level; in actual fact, however, it is a greater deed than remaining in an ordered condition at the expense of the other side of our being, which is thus at the mercy of decay.</p>
<p><em>pp. 103–119</em>3</p>
<p>The scene of the action is the same place as in the first image. The allusion to a crater heightens the impression of a large cavity that reaches far down into the interior of the earth; this depth is not inactive, but violently discharges all kinds of matter.</p>
<p>Since Eros poses the most serious problem at first, Salome enters the scene, blindly groping her way <em>toward the left</em>. Even what appear to be negligible details are important in such visionary images. The left is the side of the inauspicious. This suggests that Eros does not tend toward the right, the side of consciousness, conscious will and conscious choice, but toward the side of the heart, which is less subject to our conscious will. This movement toward the left is emphasized by the fact that the serpent moves in the same direction. The serpent represents magical power, which also appears where animal drives are aroused imperceptibly in us. They afford the movement of Eros the uncanny emphasis that strikes us as magical. Magical effect is the enchantment and underlining of our thought and feeling through dark instinctual impulses of an animal nature.</p>
<p>The movement toward the left is blind, that is, without purpose and intention. It hence requires guidance, not by conscious intention but by Logos. Elijah calls Salome back. Her blindness is an affliction, and as such demands healing. Closer scrutiny at least partially invalidates the prejudice against her. She seems to be innocent, and perhaps her badness ought to be attributed to her blindness.</p>
<p>Logos asserts its power over Eros by calling back Salome. The serpent also obeys Logos. It rests with Logos and Eros to emphasize the power and significance of this image. A natural consequence of this magical, powerful view of the union of Logos and Eros is the strongly felt smallness and insignificance of the I, which finds expression in a sense of boyishness.</p>
<p>It appears as if the movement toward the left, following blind Eros, is not possible, or effectively disallowed, without the intervention of Logos. From the perspective of Logos, following a movement blindly is a sin, because it is one-sided and violates the law that man must forever strive for the highest degree of consciousness. Therein lies his humanity. The other he has in common with animals. Jesus also says, “If you know what you are doing, you are blessed; if you do not know what you are doing, you are damned.”4 The movement toward the left would be possible and permitted only if a conscious, <em>seeing</em> notion of it existed. Formulating such a notion is not possible without the intervention of Logos.</p>
<p>The first step toward developing such a notion is to become conscious of the goal or intention of the movement. Hence Elijah asks about the intention of the I. And it must admit its blindness, that is, its ignorance about intention. The only recognizable thing is a longing, a wish, to unravel the embroilment caused by the first image.</p>
<p>Such making conscious stirs a vague sense of happiness in Salome. Understandably so, since consciousness means insight, that is, a healing of her blindness. Thus a step toward attaining the healing of Eros is taken.</p>
<p>At first the I remains in its inferior position, since its ignorance prevents it from surveying the further development of its problem. Nor would it know which direction to take, since it has never cast its gaze into the depths of its psychic substratum, but has seen only what meets the eye and recognized only the powers of consciousness and the conscious world as effective forces, half-consciously denying its inner impulses. Faced with its own depths, such an I can only feel embarrassed. Its belief in a conscious upperworld had been so firm that going down into the depths of the self is like guilt, a betrayal of conscious ideals.</p>
<p>But since its desire to unravel the embroilment is greater than its aversion to its own inferiority, the I entrusts itself to the guidance of Logos. Since nothing comes into view that could answer the question raised, even greater depths must evidently be opened up. This in turn occurs with the help of the crystal, that is, through the utmost concentration of expectant attention. The first image to appear in the crystal is the mother of God with child.</p>
<p>This image is obviously related, and opposed, to the vision of Eve in the first image. Just as Eve represents carnal temptation and carnal motherhood, the mother of God stands for carnal virginity and spiritual motherhood. The first direction would be a movement of Eros toward the flesh, the latter toward the spirit. Eve is an expression of the carnal side, whereas Mary expresses the spiritual side of Eros. As long as the I saw only Eve, it was blind. The evocation of awareness, however, affords a spiritual view of Eros. In the first case the I became an Odysseus on an adventurous journey, which concludes with the aging man’s return to Penelope, the motherly woman.</p>
<p>In the latter case the I is depicted as Peter, the chosen rock upon which the Church is to be founded. The key as the symbol of the power of binding and loosing buttresses this idea, and leads one to the image of the pope as God’s governor on earth with a threefold crown.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the I becomes involved in a movement toward spiritual power, as attested by the one-sidedness of the movement. The vision of Eve leads astray, to adventurous odyssey, to Circe and Calypso. The vision of the mother of God, on the other hand, turns desire away from the flesh and toward the humble veneration of the spirit. Eros is subject to error in the flesh, but in the spirit it rises above the flesh and the inferiority of carnal error. It therefore almost imperceptibly becomes the spirit, the power over the flesh in the guise of love, and thus spiritual power casts off the mantle of love; although the former believes it loves the spirit, in effect it rules the flesh. And the more powerful it is, the less loving it is. And the less it loves the spirit, the more it is carnal power. On account of its power over the flesh, the love of the spirit thus becomes a secular power-drive in spiritual guise.</p>
<p>Christ overcame the world by burdening himself with its suffering. But Buddha overcame both the pleasure and suffering of the world by disposing of both. And thus he entered into nonbeing, a condition from which there is no return. Buddha is an even higher spiritual power, that derives no pleasure from controlling the flesh, since he has altogether moved beyond pleasure and suffering. Passion, whose conquest still requires so much effort in the case of Christ and does so incessantly and in ever greater measure, has left Buddha and surrounds him as a blazing fire. He is both unaffected and untouchable.</p>
<p>But if the living I approaches this condition, its passion may leave it, though it will not die. Or are we not our passion? And what happens to our passion when it leaves the I? The I is consciousness, which only has eyes in front. It never sees what is behind it. But that is where the passion it has overcome in front regroups. Unguided by the eye of reason, unmitigated by humaneness, the fire becomes a devastating, bloodthirsty Kali, who devours the life of man from within, as the mantra of her sacrificial ceremony says: “Hail to you, O Kali, triple-eyed Goddess of dreadful aspect, from whose throat hangs a necklace of human skulls. May you be honored with this blood!” Salome must of course despair of this end, which would like to turn Eros into spirit, since Eros cannot exist without the flesh. In resisting the inferiority of the flesh, the I resists its female soul, which represents everything that strives to suppress consciousness, against spirit. Thus this path also results in an opposition. Hence the I returns from beholding the figures embodying its conflict.</p>
<p>Logos and Eros are reunited, as if they had overcome the conflict between spirit and flesh. They appear to know the solution. The movement toward the left, which started from Eros at the beginning of the image, now commences from Logos. He starts moving toward the left, to complete with seeing eyes what began in blindness. At first this movement leads into greater darkness, which is then still somewhat illumined by the reddish light. The color red points to Eros. While it does not emit a bright light, Eros at least provides an opportunity to recognize something, perhaps even merely by inducing a situation in which man can recognize something, provided Logos assists him.</p>
<p>Elijah leans against the marble lion. The lion as a royal animal signifies power. The stone suggests unshakeable firmness, thereby expressing the power and solidity of Logos. Once again awareness commences first, although now in greater depths and in renewed surroundings. Here the I experiences its smallness even more as it is even further removed from the world it knows, where it is conscious of its value and meaning. In these new surroundings there is nothing to remind it of its meaning. Hence it is obviously overwhelmed by so much otherness, which so completely eludes its own discretion. Elijah assumes control of developing awareness.</p>
<p>As the crystal visions have shown, the idea that should be conveyed to consciousness is an idea of spiritual power, that is, the I was tempted to arrogate prophethood. But this idea encountered such a feeling of resistance that it could not assert itself against consciousness. Hence it remained behind the curtain. But since the I could not follow Eros blindly, it sought at least to exchange spiritual power for this loss—as observed so very often in human life! It is almost inevitable that such a great loss, like that of Eros, presses man to search for a substitute at least in the sphere of power. This occurs in such an uncanny, cunning manner that the I mostly fails to notice the ruse. Which explains why the I as a rule cannot enjoy its power, since it does not possess power, but is possessed by the power-devil. In this case it would have been easy for the I to grasp the fact that Elijah imposes himself with such living reality, and lay claim to this figure as a personality valuable in itself. But awareness has forestalled this deception.</p>
<p>The appearance of living figures should not be taken personally, even though one is obviously inclined to assume responsibility for them. In reality such figures belong just as much or little to our personality as our hands and feet. The mere presence of hands or feet is not characteristic of personality. If anything about them is characteristic, it is merely their individual character. It is thus characteristic of the I that the old man and the young maiden are called Elijah and Salome; they might just as well have been called Simon Magus and Helena. What is significant, however, is that they are biblical figures. As proven later, this is one of the peculiarities of the psychic entanglement belonging to this moment.</p>
<p>The awareness of the alluring idea of spiritual power shifts the question of Eros into the foreground again, once more in a new form: both the possibility indicated by Eve and the one represented by Mary are ruled out. Hence the third possibility remains, namely filial relationship, which avoids the two extremes of the flesh and the spirit: Elijah as the father, Salome as the sister, the I as the son and brother. This solution corresponds to the Christian notion of childhood in God. Salome—as Mary—makes up the as-yet-absent mother in what is a formidably ensnaring manner. This has a corresponding effect on the I. There is something undeniably cathartic about the Christian solution—because it seems to be altogether possible. There is a child in each of us; in the elderly, it is even the only thing still alive. One can have recourse to the childlike anytime, on account of its inexhaustible freshness and adherence. Everything, even the most ominous, can be rendered harmless through retranslation into the childlike. After all, we do this often enough in everyday life. We even manage to tame a passion by leading it back to the childlike, and perhaps the flame of passion collapses in a childlike lament even more often. Thus there are many prospects for which the childlike can seem to be a satisfactory remedy, including not least the far-reaching effect of our Christian education, which hammers into us the notion of childhood in hundreds of mantras and hymns.</p>
<p>Salome’s remark that Mary is their mother must thus appear even more devastating. Since this prevents the childlike solution from developing, it immediately prompts another thought: If Mary is the mother, then <em>inescapably I must be Christ</em>. The childlike solution would have canceled all reservations: Salome would no longer pose a threat, since she would be only the little sister. Elijah would be the caring father, whose wisdom and foresight would have left the I to its own devices with childlike trust.</p>
<p>But this is the unfortunate drawback constituted by childhood as a solution: every child wishes to grow. Being a child involves the burning desire and impatience for future adulthood. If we return to being a child for fear of the dangers of Eros, the child will want to develop toward spiritual power. But if we flee into childhood for fear of the dangers of the spirit, we fall into arrogating the power of Eros.</p>
<p>The condition of spiritual childhood constitutes a transition in which not everyone can remain. In this case it stands to reason that Eros demonstrates to the I the impossibility of being a child. One might think that it is not that awful to renounce the condition of childhood. But only those who fail to grasp the consequences of this renunciation think that way. It is not the loss of immemorial Christian views and the religious possibilities they ensured—many bear this loss all too easily—but rather that what is renounced refers to the much more profound attitude that far transcends the Christian outlook, which provides individual life and thought with a tried and tested direction. Even if one has long abstained from Christian religious practice and has long ceased to regret this loss, one continues to behave intuitively as if the original views still existed by right. One fails to consider that a discarded worldview needs to be replaced by a new one; in particular one fails to be clear about the fact that renouncing the Christian outlook erodes present-day morals. Renouncing childhood means that no emotional or habitual dependence on hitherto valid moral views any longer exists. The hitherto valid view has arisen from the spirit of the Christian worldview.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all free thinking, our attitude to Eros, for instance, remains the old Christian view. We can now no longer bide our time peacefully without questioning and doubt, or else we will remain in the state of childhood. If we merely reject the dogmatic view, our liberation from the well-established will be merely intellectual, whereas our deeper feeling will persist on the old path. Most people, however, are unaware of how this sets them at odds with themselves. But later generations will become increasingly aware of this. Yet those who notice this will realize with horror that renouncing resumed childhood ousts them from our present times and that they can no longer follow any of the traditional ways. They enter uncharted territory, which has neither paths nor boundaries. They lack any direction, since they have forsaken all established bearings. This realization, however, dawns upon very few, since the vast majority makes do with half measures, and remains unperturbed by the stupidity of their spiritual condition. But then tepidity and slackness is not to everyone’s taste. Some would rather abandon themselves to despair than adhere to a worldview completely removed from the well-trodden paths of their habitual behavior. They would rather venture into a pathless, dark land at the risk of perishing there, even if this should outrage all their cowardice.</p>
<p>When Salome remarks that Mary is their mother, which means that the I is Christ, this means in brief that the I has left the state of Christian childhood and has taken the place of Christ. Nothing could be more absurd, of course, than to assume that the I thus would be presuming excessive importance; on the contrary, it takes up a decidedly inferior position. Previously it had the advantage of being part of the crowd rallying behind a powerful figure, but now it has exchanged that for solitude and forlornness, rendering it as alien and lonely in its world as Jesus was in his, without possessing that great man’s outstanding attributes. Being at odds with the world requires greatness, but the I experiences its almost ludicrous meagerness. Which explains its horror at Salome’s revelations.</p>
<p>Whoever steps beyond the Christian outlook, yet does so definitely, falls into a seeming abyss, an utmost solitude, and lacks any means of hiding the fact. Of course one would like to persuade oneself that this is not all that bad. But it is. Abandonment is about the worst thing that can happen to man’s herd instinct, not to mention the daunting task with which we thus burden ourselves. Destruction is easy, but rebuilding is difficult.</p>
<p>Thus the image ends with a sense of gloom, which stands opposed, however, to the tall, quietly burning flame encircled by the serpent. This view denotes devotion coupled with the magical compulsion expressed by the serpent. Thus an effective counterpart is set against the disquieting sense of doubt and fear, as if someone were saying, “Of course your I is full of unease and doubt, but the constant flame of devotion burns in you more strongly and the compulsion of your fate is more powerful.”</p>
<p><em>pp. 127–150</em>5</p>
<p>The far-reaching premonitions of the second image plunged the I into a chaos of doubt. Hence an understandable desire arose to rise above the confusion to attain greater clarity, as expressed in the image of the beetling mountain ridge. Logos appears to be leading the way. What occurs next is the image of two opposites, expressed by two serpents and the separation of day and night. Daylight signifies good, whereas darkness represents evil. As compelling forces, both assume the figure of serpents. Therein lies concealed an idea that subsequently assumes great importance: whoever encountered a black serpent would have been no less surprised at encountering a white one. Color does not dispel fear. What this suggests is that perhaps an equally dangerous, bewitching power resides in good as in evil. Essentially, the good needs to be regarded as an inherently no-less-dangerous principle than evil. In any event, the I could decide to approach the white serpent just as little as the black one, even though it believes it can or must by all means entrust itself more to good than to evil. But the I is rooted to the spot halfway, transfixed, and observes the struggle between the two principles—within itself.</p>
<p>The fact that the I remains in this middle position implies the advance of evil, since anything but unconditional surrender to the good impairs it. This finds expression in the attack of the black serpent. But the fact that the I does not partake of evil constitutes a victory for the good. This finds expression in the black serpent growing a white head.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the serpent denotes that the opposition of good and evil has become ineffective, that is, that at least it has lost its immediate significance. For the I this means a release from the unconditional power of the hitherto abiding moral point of view in favor of a middle position freed from the pair of opposites. But neither clarity nor a clear view has been gained thereby; hence the ascent continues to the final point of elevation, which might grant the longed-for outlook.</p>

<p>Appendix C</p>
<p>The following is an entry from <em>Black Book 5</em>, pp. 163–78, which gives a preliminary sketch of cosmology of the <em>Septem Sermones</em>.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>I. 16.</li>
</ol>
<p>The force of the God is frightful.</p>
<p>“You shall experience even more of it. You are in the second age. The first age has been overcome. This is the age of the rulership of the son, whom you call the Frog God. A third age will follow, the age of apportionment and harmonious power.”</p>
<p>My soul, where did you go? Did you go to the animals?</p>
<p>I bind the Above with the Below. I bind God and animal. Something in me is part animal, something part God, and a third part human. Below you serpent, within you man, and above you God. Beyond the serpent comes the phallus, then the earth, then the moon, and finally the coldness and emptiness of outer space.</p>
<p>Above you comes the dove or the celestial soul, in which love and foresight are united, just as poison and shrewdness are united in the serpent. Shrewdness is the devil’s understanding, which always detects smaller things and finds chinks where you suspect none.</p>
<p>If I am not conjoined through the uniting of the Below and the Above, I break down into three parts: the <em>serpent</em>, and in that or some other animal form I roam, living nature daimonically, arousing fear and longing. The <em>human soul</em>, living forever within you. The <em>celestial soul</em>, as such dwelling with the Gods, far from you and unknown to you, appearing in the form of a bird. Each of these three parts then is independent.</p>
<p>Beyond me stands the celestial mother. Its counterpart is the phallus. Its mother is the earth, its goal is the heavenly mother.</p>
<p>The celestial mother is the daughter of the celestial world. Its counterpart is the earth.</p>
<p>The celestial mother is illuminated through the spiritual sun. Its counterpart is the moon. And just as the moon is the crossing to the dead of space, the spiritual sun is the crossing to the Pleroma, the upper world of fullness. The moon is the God’s eye of emptiness, just as the sun is the God’s eye of fullness. The moon that you see is the symbol, just as the sun that you see. Sun and moon, that is, their symbols, are Gods. There are still other Gods; their symbols are the planets.</p>
<p>The celestial mother is a daimon among the order of the Gods, an inhabitant of the heavenly world.</p>
<p>The Gods are favorable and unfavorable, impersonal, the souls of stars, influences, forces, grandfathers of souls, rulers in the heavenly world, both in space and in force. They are neither dangerous nor kind, strong, yet humble, clarifications of the Pleroma and of the eternal emptiness, configurations of the eternal qualities.</p>
<p>Their number is immeasurably great and leads over to the one supreme fundamental, which contains all qualities in itself and itself has none, a nothing and everything, the complete dissolution of man, death and eternal life.</p>
<p>Man becomes through the <em>principium individuationis</em>. He strives for absolute individuality, through which he ever increasingly concentrates the absolute dissolution of the Pleroma. Through this he makes the Pleroma the point that contains the greatest tension and is itself a shining star, immeasurably small, just as the Pleroma is immeasurably great. The more concentrated the Pleroma becomes, the stronger the star of the individual becomes. It is surrounded by shining clouds, a heavenly body in the making, comparable to a small sun. It emits fire. Therefore it is called: εγω [ειμι] συμπλανοζυμιν αστηρ.1 Just like the sun, which is also such a star, which is a God and grandfather of souls, the star of the individual is also like the sun, a God and grandfather of the souls. He is visible from time to time, just as I have described him. His light is blue, like that of a distant star. He is far out in space, cold and solitary, since he is beyond death. To attain individuality, we need a large share of death. Therefore it is called ει εοι εστε,2 since just as an innumerable number of men rule the earth, so a countless number of stars and of Gods rule the celestial world.</p>
<p>To be sure, this God is the one who survives the death of men. To him for whom solitude is Heaven, he goes to Heaven; to him for whom it is Hell, he goes to Hell. Whoever does not follow the <em>principium individuationis</em> to its end becomes no God, since he cannot bear individuality.</p>
<p>The dead who besiege us are souls who have not fulfilled the <em>principium individuationis</em>, or else they would have become distant stars. Insofar as we do not fulfill it, the dead have a claim on us and besiege us and we cannot escape them. [Image]3</p>
<p>The God of the frogs or toads, the brainless, is the uniting of the Christian God with Satan. His nature is like the flame; he is like Eros, but a God; Eros is only a daimon.</p>
<p>The <em>one God</em>, to whom worship is due, is in the middle.</p>
<p><em>You should worship only one God</em>. The other Gods are unimportant. <em>Abraxas is to be feared</em>. Therefore it was a deliverance when he separated himself from me. You do not need to seek him. He will find you, just like Eros. He is the God of the cosmos, extremely powerful and fearful. He is the creative drive, he is form and formation, just as much as matter and force, therefore he is above all the light and dark Gods. He tears away souls and casts them into procreation. He is the creative and created. He is the God who always renews himself, in days, in months, in years, in human life, in ages, in peoples, in the living, in heavenly bodies. He compels, he is unsparing. If you worship him, you increase his power over you. Thereby it becomes unbearable. You will have dreadful trouble getting clear of him. The more you free yourself from him, the more you approach death, since he is the life of the universe. But he is also universal death. Therefore you fall victim to him again, not in life but in dying. So remember him, do not worship him, but also do not imagine that you can flee him since he is all around you. You must be in the middle of life, surrounded by death on all sides. Stretched out, like one crucified, you hang in him, the fearful, the overpowering.</p>
<p>But you have in you the <em>one</em> God, the wonderfully beautiful and kind, the solitary, starlike, unmoving, he who is older and wiser than the father, he who has a safe hand, who leads you among all the darknesses and death scares of dreadful Abraxas. He gives joy and peace, since he is beyond death and beyond what is subject to change. He is no servant and no friend of Abraxas. He himself is an Abraxas, but not unto you, but in himself and his distant world, since you yourself are a God who lives in faraway realms and who renews himself in his ages and creations and peoples, just as powerful to them as Abraxas is to you.</p>
<p>You yourself are a creator of worlds and a created being.</p>
<p>You have the <em>one</em> God, and you become your <em>one</em> God in the innumerable number of Gods.</p>
<p>As a God, you are the great Abraxas in your world. But as a man you are the heart of the one God who appears to his world as the great Abraxas, the feared, the powerful, the donor of madness, he who dispenses the water of life, the spirit of the tree of life, the daimon of the blood, the death bringer.</p>
<p>You are the suffering heart of your <em>one</em> star God, who is Abraxas to his world.</p>
<p>Therefore because you are the heart of your God, aspire toward him, love him, live for him. Fear Abraxas, who rules over the human world. Accept what he forces upon you, since he is the master of the life of this world and none can escape him. If you do not accept, he will torment you to death and the heart of your God will suffer, just as the one God of Christ suffered the heaviest in his death.</p>
<p>The suffering of mankind is without end, since its life is without end. Since there is no end where none sees an end. If mankind has come to an end, there is none who would see its end and none who could say that mankind has an end. So it has no end for itself, but it certainly does for the Gods.</p>
<p>The death of Christ took no suffering away from the world, but his life has taught us much; namely, that it pleases the <em>one</em> God if the individual lives his own life against the power of Abraxas. The <em>one</em> God thus delivers himself from the suffering of the earth into which his Eros plunged him; since when the <em>one</em> God saw the earth, he sought its procreation, and forgot that a world was already given to him in which he was Abraxas. So the <em>one</em> God became human. Therefore the one in turn pulls man up to him and into him, so that the one becomes complete again.</p>
<p>But the freeing of man from the power of Abraxas does not follow man’s withdrawing from the power of Abraxas—no one can pull away from it—but through subjugating himself to it. Even Christ had to subjugate himself to the power of Abraxas, and Abraxas killed him in a gruesome manner.</p>
<p>Only by living life can you free yourself from it. So live it to such a degree that it befits you. To the degree that you live it, you also fall victim to the power of Abraxas and his dreadful deceptions. But to the same degree the star God in you gains in longing and power, in that the fruit of deception and human disappointment falls to him. Pain and disappointment fill the world of Abraxas with coldness, all of your life’s warmth slowly sinks into the depths of your soul, into the midpoint of man, where the far blue starlight of your one God glimmers.</p>
<p>If you flee Abraxas from fear, you escape pain and disappointment and you remain terrified, that is, out of unconscious love you cling to Abraxas and your <em>one</em> God cannot catch fire. But through pain and disappointment you redeem yourself, since your longing then falls of its own accord like a ripe fruit into the depths, following gravity, striving toward the midpoint, where the blue light of the star God arises.</p>
<p>So do not flee from Abraxas, do not seek him. You feel his coercion, do not resist him, so that you shall live and pay your ransom.</p>
<p>The works of Abraxas are to be fulfilled, for consider that in your world you yourself are Abraxas and force your creature to fulfil your work. Here, where you are the creature subjugated to Abraxas, you must learn to fulfill the work of life. There, where you are Abraxas, you compel your creatures.</p>
<p>You ask, why is all this so? I understand that it seems questionable to you. The world is questionable. It is the unending infinite folly of the Gods, which you know is unendingly wise. Surely it is also a crime, an unforgivable sin, and therefore also the highest love and virtue.</p>
<p>So live life, do not flee Abraxas, provided that he compels you and you can recognize his necessity. In one sense I say to you: do not fear him, do not love him. In another sense I say: fear him, love him. <em>He is the life of the earth</em>, that says enough.</p>
<p>You need to recognize the multiplicity of the Gods. You cannot unite all into one being. As little as you are one with the multiplicity of men, just so little is the <em>one</em> God one with the multiplicity of the Gods. This one God is the kind, the loving, the leading, the healing. To him all your love and worship is due. To him you should pray, you are one with him, he is near you, nearer than your soul.</p>
<p>I, your soul, am your mother, who tenderly and frightfully surrounds you, your nourisher and corrupter; I prepare good things and poison for you. I am your intercessor with Abraxas. I teach you the arts that protect you from Abraxas. I stand between you and Abraxas the all-encompassing. I am your body, your shadow, your effectiveness in this world, your manifestation in the world of the Gods, your effulgence, your breath, your odor, your magical force. You should call me if you want to live with men, but the <em>one</em> God if you want to rise above the human world to the divine and eternal solitude of the star.</p>
<p>1.“I am a star, wandering about with you.” —A citation from the Mithras Liturgy (Albrecht Dieterich, <em>Eine Mithrasliturgie</em> [Leipzig: B. G. Teubner, 1903], p. 8, line 5). Jung carved the continuation of this sentence on his stone at Bollingen.</p>
<p>2.“You are Gods.” This is a citation from John 10:34: “The Jews answered him, saying, for a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makesth thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”</p>

<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>Given the unpublished copies in circulation, the <em>Red Book</em> would in all likelihood have eventually entered the public domain at some stage, in some form. In what follows, I would like to thank those who have enabled the present historical edition to come about. A number of people collaborated and they have each in their own way contributed to its realization.</p>
<p>The former Society of Heirs of C. G. Jung (dissolved in 2008) decided in spring 2000 after intensive discussion to release the work for publication. On the behalf of the Society of Heirs, Ulrich Hoerni, formerly its manager and president and presently the vice president of its successor, the Foundation of the Works of C. G. Jung, planned the project with the support of the executive committee. Wolfgang Baumann, president from 2000 to 2004, signed the agreement in autumn 2000 that made possible the commencement of the work and committed the Society of Heirs to underwrite a major part of the costs. The Foundation of the Works of C. G. Jung would like to thank: Heinrich Zweifel, publisher, Zürich, for advice in the planning phase on technical issues; The Donald Cooper Fund of the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology for a significant donation; Rolf Auf der Maur for legal advice and contractual assistance; Leo La Rosa and Peter Fritz for contractual negotiations.</p>
<p>At a critical moment in 2003, the editorial work was supported by the Bogette Foundation and an anonymous donor. From 2004, the editorial work was supported by the Philemon Foundation, an organization established with the sole purpose of raising funds to enable Jung’s unpublished works to see the light of day. In this regard, I am indebted to Stephen Martin. Whatever the shortcomings of this edition, the editorial apparatus and the translation could not have attained anything like the current level without the support of the Board of the Philemon Foundation: Tom Charlesworth, Gilda Frantz, Nancy Furlotti, Judith Harris, James Hollis, Stephen Martin, and Eugene Taylor. The Philemon Foundation would like to acknowledge the support of its donors, in particular, the MSST Foundation, Carolyn Grant Fay, Judith Harris and Tony Woolfson, and significant gifts toward the English translation from Nancy Furlotti and Laurence de Rosen.</p>
<p>My work on this project would not have been possible without the support of Maggie Baron and Ximena Roelli de Angulo through numerous tribulations. It commenced and was made possible by research on the intellectual history of Jung’s work sponsored by the Wellcome Trust between 1993 and 1998, by the Institut für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie in 1999, and the Solon Foundation between 1998 and 2001. Throughout the project, the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London (formerly the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine) has been an ideal environment for my research. Confidentiality agreements precluded discussing my work on this project with my friends and colleagues: I thank them for their forbearance over the last thirteen years.</p>
<p>Between late 2000 and early 2003 the Society of Heirs of C. G. Jung supported the editorial work, which initiated the project. Ulrich Hoerni collaborted with aspects of the research and made a corrected transcription of the calligraphic volume. Susanne Hoerni transcribed Jung’s <em>Black Books</em>. Presentations were made to members of the Jung family in 1999, 2001, and 2003, which were hosted by Helene Hoerni Jung (1999, 2001) and Andreas and Vreni Jung (2003). Peter Jung provided counsel through the publication deliberations and early stages of the editorial work. Andreas and Vreni Jung assisted during countless visits to consult books and manuscripts in Jung’s library, and Andreas Jung provided invaluable information from the Jung family archives.</p>
<p>This edition came about through Nancy Furlotti, and Larry and Sandra Vigon, who led me to Jim Mairs at Norton, who had been responsible for the facsimile edition of Larry Vigon’s modern-day <em>Liber Novus</em>, <em>Dream</em>. In Jim Mairs, the work could not have found a better editor. The design and layout of the work provided numerous challenges, elegantly resolved by Eric Baker, Larry Vigon, and Amy Wu. Carol Rose was tireless and ever-vigilant in copyediting the text. Austin O’Driscoll was of continuous assistance. For the Reader’s Edition Laura Lindgren has designed an elegantly fitting layout and made a number of corrections. The calligraphic volume was scanned by Hugh Milstein and John Supra of Digital Fusion.The care and the precision of their work (focusing via sonar) met with and matched the care and precision of Jung’s calligraphy in a remarkable fusion of the ancient and the modern. Dennis Savini made his photographic studio available for the scanning. At Mondadori Printing Nancy Freeman, Sergio Brunelli, and their colleagues took great care to ensure that the work was printed to the highest standards technically possible.</p>
<p>From 2006, I was joined by Mark Kyburz and John Peck on the translation—a collaboration that was a privileged instruction in the art of translation. Our regular conference calls provided the welcome opportunity to discuss the text at a microscopic level, and the humor brought much-needed levity to the constant immersion in the spirit of the depths. Their contributions to the later stages of the editorial work have been invaluable. John Peck picked up several significant allusions that were beyond my ken.</p>
<p>Ximena Roelli de Angulo, Helene Hoerni Jung, Pierre Keller, and the late Leonhard Schlegel provided crucial recollections of the atmosphere in Jung’s circle in the twenties, and figures involved in it. Leonhard Schlegel provided critical insights into the Dada movement and the collisions between art and psychology in this period.</p>
<p>Erik Hornung provided consultation concerning Egyptological references. Felix Walder assisted with a digital close-up of image 155, Ulrich Hoerni deciphered its small inscriptions, and Guy Attewell recognized the Arabic inscription. Ulrich Hoerni provided references to the Mithraic Liturgy (note 1, p. 578). David Oswald pointed to the <em>Mutus Liber</em> as Jung’s possible referent in note 314 (p. 429). Thomas Feitknecht drew my attention to and assisted with the J. B. Lang papers. Stephen Martin recovered Jung’s letters to J. B. Lang. Paul Bishop, Wendy Doniger and Rachel McDermott responded to queries.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Ernst Falzeder for the reference in note 145 on p. 46, for transcribing Stockmayer’s letters to Jung, and for extensively correcting the translation of the introduction and notes in the German edition.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Foundation of the Works of C. G. Jung and the Paul and Peter Fritz Literary Agency for permission to cite from Jung’s unpublished manuscripts and correspondences, and Ximena Roelli de Angulo for permission to cite from Cary Baynes’s correspondence and diaries.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the establishment of the text, the introduction, and the apparatus remains my own. Like the donkey on page 126 (note 29), I am glad finally to be able to lay down this load.</p>

<p>前言</p>
<p>一位平凡的人，用一生的时间，写了一部神奇的书：</p>
<p>书以菜根为名，400条语录形似一部小品文，上至治国平天下，下至修身齐家，人世中的大道几乎无所不包。它称得上是文坛上的奇迹，那最长不超过三行字的家常话，带给我们的却是另一个美丽的世界：它充满了哲学的思辨，充满了禅的诗情画意、儒家的为人哲理、道家的处世思想，还有佛家既入世又出世的修身之道。</p>
<p>当我们处身数字化和网络化的城市喧嚣，身心与日俱增变得焦躁不安以至于一天天心慌失眠时，它仿佛一汪清泉，涤去我们心中的焦躁；它又如一缕清风，吹去我们心中的烦恼。</p>
<p>——这本书就是《菜根谭》。这个人就是洪应明。</p>
<p>洪应明，字自诚，号还初道人，大约生活在内忧外患渐现端倪的明朝万历年间。史料上关于他的事迹没有太多记载，然而，他的旷世之作《菜根谭》却透着禅的意蕴，藏着道的机锋、儒的世事，读后使人氤氲蒙蔽的心灵豁然开朗。</p>
<p>洪应明说：“自老视少，可以消奔驰角逐之心；自瘁视荣，可以绝纷华靡丽之念。”用这样的眼光去看待一切，人才能始终保持一颗冷静的心。那些不能向内观照，一味地向外追逐名利的人，则永远生活在空虚与烦恼之中，“一场闲富贵，狠狠争来，虽得还是失”。反之，只要拥有平常心，“宠辱不惊，闲看庭外花开花落；去留无意，漫随天外云卷云舒”，就能做到心静如水、不为利害所动，进入荣辱不惊、去留无意的坦然境界。</p>
<p>宋人汪信民说：“人咬得菜根，则百事可做。”明人孔兼称：“谭以菜根名，固自清苦历练中来，亦自栽培灌溉里得。”读懂了《菜根谭》，体会出人生百种滋味，就能做到“风急雨斜处，立得脚定；花浓柳艳处，着得眼高；路危径险处，回得头早”。</p>
<p>在处世方面，孔子的观点是：“邦有道，不废；邦无道，免于刑戮”；“有道则见，无道则隐”；“邦有道，则仕；邦无道，则卷而怀之（把本领收起来放入怀里，指退隐）”。像这种富于变通的处世方法在《菜根谭》里无所不在。诸如：“处治世宜方，处乱世宜圆，处叔季之世（末世）当方圆并用”；“达人观物外之物，思身后之身”；“君子与其练达，不若朴鲁；与其曲谨，不若疏狂”；“隐逸林中无荣辱，道义路上无炎凉”；“进步处便思退步，著手时先伺放手”。灵活机动，随机应变才是智者的做派。</p>
<p>然而，人的欲望大得可以吞下天地，有谁能甘心过一碟菜根的生活。但是，孔子认为有理想、有志向的君子，不会总是为自己的吃穿住而奔波，他们“吃粗粮，喝白水，弯着胳膊当枕头，乐趣也就在其中了”。洪应明也说：“世人以心肯处为乐，却被乐心引在苦处；达士以心拂处为乐，终必苦心换得乐来。”君子忧道不忧贫，菜根事小，求道事大。能否啃下菜根，是检验一个人可否成就大业的基本气候。</p>
<p>一部《菜根谭》，道尽了世间的冷暖，纳尽了人间万象。</p>
<p>此次编译，我们根据内容将全文分为修身篇、劝学篇、处世篇、经世篇、治家篇、出世篇、养生篇七部分，近400余则。每一则格言都添加标题，配有注释、译文、解读，方便阅读。在解读部分，我们用中华古典人物故事来解读原文，力求广大读者对每一条名言加深理解，加强读者对中国传统文化的认知。</p>
<p>由于时间仓促，书中难免谬误之处，敬请批评指正！</p>

<p>烈火炼真金，成事须用功</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>精金美玉①的人品，定从烈火中锻来；思立掀天揭地②的事功，须向薄冰上履过③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①精金美玉：用真金美玉比喻良好的人品或物性。</p>
<p>②掀天揭地：惊天动地，翻天覆地，形容事业的宏大重要。</p>
<p>③向薄冰上履过：在《诗经·小雅·小旻》中有“如临深渊，如履薄冰”之句，用在这里形容想做一番大事业，就需要时刻小心，谨言慎行。履过：走过，踩过。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>想成为拥有优良品德的人，那就要像真金不怕火炼一样，经受种种艰难困苦的磨练：想建一番惊天动地的功业，那就要像每天走在薄冰上一样，战战兢兢，时刻小心。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>宝剑锋自磨砺出，梅花香自苦寒来。无论身处什么时代，要想成为卓越杰出的人才，都需要有坚毅顽强的品格，超人的耐性；要想成就一番事业，更需要有百折不挠、不达目的不罢休的精神与战战兢兢如履薄冰的谨慎态度。</p>
<p>艰难困苦，玉汝于成。放眼看去，古今中外品德高尚、成就大事业者，无不经艰难困苦锤炼。兢兢业业，以如走在薄冰上的谨慎态度自律与做事，方成就大业。这样的事例数不胜数。李时珍写《本草纲目》用30年时间，走遍中国大江南北，采集标本。马克思写《资本论》用40年时间。司马迁身经酷刑，写出《史记》。诺贝尔经过8年煎熬，身体健康受到损害，不受邻居欢迎，坚持研制无烟炸药。水稻之父袁隆平教授，研究培育杂交水稻，亦是克服无数困难方才成功。数十年如一日，坚持研究箸书，离不开坚毅的精神与时刻自律。</p>
<p>学界如此，商界也如此。众多商界成功人士，谈及成功之道时，多会强调时时刻刻保持谨慎的重要性。商场如战场，对于众多商家来说，要想在厮杀激烈的战场中杀出一条路，就需要时刻保持清醒，战战兢兢如履薄冰。香港首富李嘉诚曾说过：苦难的生活，是人生的最好锻炼，是花费大量金钱也买不到的宝贵经验：身处瞬息万变的社会，要居安思危，时刻做好准备。</p>
<p>出水芙蓉</p>
<p>收获的季节里，丰硕果实的收割，离不开耕耘季节里的辛勤播种培育。对于如金似玉的优良人品，惊天动地的丰功伟绩，世人欣赏与惊羡之余，可以多想想其背后锤炼之艰辛。在竞争激烈的今天，没有一种事业可以一蹴而就，也没有一种成功能够唾手可得。成功的果实，需要精心灌溉耕耘。经过一番脱胎换骨的磨练，定能有所收获。正所谓“有志者，事竟成，破釜沉舟，百二秦关终属楚；苦心人，天不负，卧薪尝胆，三千越甲可吞吴”。</p>
<p>在竞争激烈的今天，现代人无论是学习还是工作，都需要有这种顽强的精神。不怕失败，不怕吃苦，不怕磨练，时刻保持清醒，为自己的人生信仰与事业目标不停奋斗。</p>
<p>一念错皆错，万善全方全</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>一念错，便觉百行皆非，防之当如渡海浮囊①，勿容一针之罅漏②；万善全，始得一生无愧，修之当如凌云宝树③，须假众木以撑持④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①渡海浮囊：浮水用的皮囊，多用牛皮或者羊皮制成。充满气后，扎紧气囊口，人带着它可以渡河过江。《神机制敌太白阴经·济水具》中有记载：“浮囊以浑脱羊皮吹气令满，紧缚其孔，缚于肋下，可以渡也。”</p>
<p>②罅：裂缝。</p>
<p>③凌云宝树：宝树，佛教用语，在《妙法莲花经·如来寿量品》中有“宝树无花果，众生所游乐”之句。凌云，谓高入云霄，极言其高。</p>
<p>④假：凭借，依靠。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个念头错了，便觉得几乎所有行为都不正确了。所以要提高警惕，谨防一念之差。对于差错的提防，就好比对待渡河用的皮囊，不允许有一个针眼大的裂缝。各种各样的好事都去做，才能无愧于此生。就像那西方佛地的宝树靠众多树木扶持一样，修身也需要人们多多积累善行。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一念之差，悔之晚矣。可见人生在世当步步谨慎，错不得一步；各种各样的好事都做过，德行才算圆满，一生可谓无愧无悔。中国春秋时期，吴国与越国进行了一场战争。吴国大胜，越国战败，越王勾践成为吴国的俘虏。勾践小心服侍着吴王夫差，千方百计讨夫差欢喜。夫差得意之下，不顾老臣伍子胥的劝阻，允许勾践回到越国。勾践回国之后，对内励精图强，发展生产，勤练士兵；对外送美女西施与众多奇珍异宝给夫差，使他沉溺于奢侈享受的生活中。越国经过多年的精心准备后，与吴国又进行了一场战争。这一次越国大获全胜，越王勾践终于洗刷了昔日的耻辱。吴王夫差十分后悔当初没有听伍子胥的劝告。一念之差，纵虎归山，导致了自己的失败。</p>
<p>在现代社会，我们会面临许多挑战与发展机会，还会遇到形形色色的诱惑。机会稍纵即逝，挑战应对不及时，便会失败。稍不留神，诱惑便乘虚而入。小陈本是一位有光明前途的青年，虽然刚离开学校生活清苦些，但未来的发展前景很好。一次偶然的机会，他结识了一位有钱的朋友小王，两个人常相约一起出去玩。小王比较粗心，对自己的东西不在意，经常丢三落四。他取了许多现金与小陈吃午饭，中间接了一个电话。由于饭店里太嘈杂，小王到外面听电话，装了许多现金的包就放在桌子上，小陈看在眼里。他感觉周围人没有注意自己，打开小王的包，取了钱放到自己包里。买单时，小陈抢着付了账。小王当时没有发现丢钱，等到发现钱不见了的时候，他也丝毫没有怀疑到小陈。小王粗心，警察可不粗心。警察经过调查，发现钱被小陈拿走了。小陈清白的履历表上涂上了一个污点。他非常后悔，当时没能消除邪念贪欲。立身修德，全靠平时积累，时时事事都须谨慎，心思行动处处光明磊落。点滴积累，不能有一丝懈怠，时刻都要去邪念，修善念。</p>
<p>闲中消忙错，静时息非心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>忙处事为①，常向闲中先检点，过举②自稀③；动时念想，预从静里密操持，非心自息。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①事为：行为，举动。</p>
<p>②过举：不正确、不恰当的言行举止。</p>
<p>③稀：减少。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在忙碌时做事情，常常在空闲时先检查反省，这样错误的行为自然会减少。行动中产生的想法，预先在安静时仔细考虑，不良的想法自然会消失。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在繁忙时做事情，忙中生乱，很容易犯错误；在匆忙之中产生一些想法，没有经过仔细考虑，这些想法很可能是不好的想法。因此做事情之前，应留出时间检查反省。先思考这件事情应不应该去做，应该怎样做。这样预先反复思考反省，可以使我们少犯错误。匆忙之中产生的想法，在静下心来时仔细反复考虑，一些邪念欲念自然会消火。</p>
<p>俗话常说忙中容易出错，正邪只在一念间。在忙乱中我们做事情，有时候并没有经过仔细思考。在一时冲动中产生的想法，有可能是错误的想法。忙乱的时候做事情要提前反省，冲动中产生的想法在安静时要仔细考虑推敲。这样做可以使我们在做事情、想问题时，不感情用事，冷静理智行事，有许多事情，我们在事后反思时，感觉十分后悔。世上没有后悔药，但是我们可以在念头产生后、做事情之前，预先仔细反复考虑，这样做可以使我们少犯错误。</p>
<p>小王是某大学二年级学生，她生性活泼开朗，喜欢交际游玩。在外国人的鬼节——万圣节这一天，她和朋友们出去玩，感觉不过瘾。她突然想起同宿舍小林来，小林很爱学习，每天准时去图书馆看书。小林瘦小文弱，说话办事总是很文雅的样子。小王想和小林开个玩笑，她回到宿舍，恰好宿舍里其他同学都不在。她估计小林快回来时，提前关了灯，藏在宿舍门后边。小林用钥匙打开宿舍门，正准备开灯时，借着走廊里的灯光，她看到一个全身闪着绿幽幽的光、满脸血迹的人站在自己面前。小林当即晕了过去，被送到医院抢救。不幸中的万幸是，小林被抢救过来，没有造成生命危险。小王事后才知道，小林天生体质弱，不能受惊吓。小王扮成鬼怪，只是想和小林开个玩笑，没想到会使小林进了医院，小王十分后悔。从此以后，小王告诫自己千万不要轻率行事。</p>
<p>扫事境尘氛，忘心境芥蒂</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>能轻富贵，不能轻一轻富贵之心；能重名义，又复重一重名义之念。是事境之尘氛①未扫，而心境之芥蒂②未忘。此处拔除不净，恐石去而草复生矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①尘氛：灰尘烟雾，俗世的气氛。</p>
<p>②芥蒂：细小的梗塞物，用在这里比喻妨碍人修身正心的念头想法。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>能够轻视富贵，却不能够放下轻视富贵的念头；能够重视名誉节义，却又过于强调重视名誉与节义。这样的情况说明人在为人处事时，还没有完全摆脱世俗各种欲念影响，内心依然存在世俗种种欲念。这些欲念如果没有被清除干净，恐怕会像石头下的草，当石头移开时，草又会生长起来。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>能够轻视富贵，却时时想起自己轻视富贵；能够重视道德节义，却常常强调要重视名誉道德。这样的人不能说不是君子，可是离真君子还有一段距离。真君子不重视富贵，也不会时时执念于自己轻视富贵的姿态；真君子重名义，这种重视渗透于言行举止，而不是时时将重名义的念头放在心上。</p>
<p>有一个故事讲两个同朝为官的人，一同到王爷府游玩。王爷府陈设十分华丽，金珠宝器古玩玉石摆列出许多。王官人对这些宝贝视而不见，张官人则仔细鉴赏着宝物，不时发出赞叹之声。张官人并不贪恋这些宝物，鉴赏过之后，就把这些宝物忘掉了。王官人表现出并不贪恋宝物的样子，可是相比之下，表现得过于刻意。眼中无视宝物，未必心里不惦记着财宝。说一个人轻视富贵，常说其视黄金如粪土，视功名利禄如粪土。其实真正轻视富贵，不必视其为粪土。黄金自是黄金，粪土自是粪土。若刻意强调粪土黄金之分，心中还是存有粪土贱、黄金贵的想法。真正不重视富贵，也就不必刻意强调黄金如粪土。</p>
<p>君子修身必须看重名誉节义，有名义之念是对的。但如果过于重视自己看重名义这件事情，修养还远远不够。真君子重名义，不会执着于自己看重名义的姿态。有一个故事说古时有一个姓李的善人，他一生行善事，善名远近闻名。他救济乡里，扶持贫弱，施恩从不图报。他对于别人是不是感激他，确实不放在心上，但是他将自己一生中所做的每一件善事都记录下来。他时常翻看这些笔记，为能不停做好事、修养良好德行的自己赞叹不已。一次李善人出门，看到一位姓白的老人做善事。李善人追上老人，和他攀谈起来。李善人问老人做过多少件善事，老人笑眯眯回答说忘了。行善施德是好事，过于看重自己行善施德这件事情，则是修养不够彻底。因此君子当重名义，但是不必过于自我欣赏能重名义的自己。</p>
<p>不忍伤残念，不为贪冒心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>一点不忍①的念头，是生民生物之根芽；一段不为②的气节，是撑天撑地之柱石。故君子于一虫一蚁，不忍伤残，一缕一丝，勿容贪冒③，便可为民物立命，为天地立心矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①不忍：不忍心。</p>
<p>②不为：不做。</p>
<p>③贪冒：贪图财物，“冒”用在这里与“贪”同义。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一点慈悲恻隐之心，是使民众生存、万物生长的基础；一种“君子有所不为”的风骨节操，是支撑天地的柱石。所以即使是一条虫、一只蚂蚁那样小的生物，君子也不忍心伤害它们；一丝一线的财物，君子都不会贪为己有。这样就可以使民众安乐生活，使万物顺利生长。在天地间树立一种精神，使民众与万物顺应自然规律而生存。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>中华民族是一个有优良传统的古老民族，善良与宽容是中华民族的传统美德。无论是对人还是对物，我们都不缺少同情心与慈悲心。孟子说“人之初，性本善”，老百姓常说“恻隐之心人皆有之”。在天地之间，正因为我们有慈悲之心与善良之念，才使世间万物生养繁殖，使老百姓能安居乐业。</p>
<p>毛泽东少年时，家里较富裕。毛泽东的母亲是一个很善良的人，时常接济帮助别人。毛泽东受母亲影响很大，继承母亲乐于助人的善良品质，他也经常接济帮助他人。有一年正赶上秋收的时候，家家都收割晾晒稻谷。有一天，天气突然大变，天空布满了乌云，不大一会工夫，天下起了瓢泼大雨。乡亲们都急急忙忙赶回家，抢着把正在晾晒的稻谷收回家。毛泽东家也忙着抢收稻谷，忙乱了半天，雨停了。毛泽东从外面回家，衣服都被雨淋湿了。家里人一问才知道，他帮邻居收稻谷去了，所以浑身上下都被雨水浇透了。父亲怪他自己家稻谷不忙着收，却管别人闲事。毛泽东却回答说自己家的稻谷是不用交租的，损坏一些也没关系，邻居家的谷是要交租的，如果被淋坏，他们的生活就会更艰难。</p>
<p>人们具有善良的品质，是人类社会与世间万事万物生存发展的基础。“有所为，有所不为”的气节风骨，则是支撑天地的基石。符合道义，可为人类社会发展添砖加瓦的事情应当做。只谋求自己个人利益，不惜损害国家利益，这样的事情就不应该做。一个没有气节傲骨的民族，一个没有道义廉耻的礼会，不可能长久存在与发展。中华民族历来不少有气节的人。正是这种气节风骨，支撑了中华民族不断发展。</p>
<p>拨开世尘氛，消却心鄙吝</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>拨开世上尘氛，胸中自无火炎①冰兢②；消却心中鄙吝③，眼前时有月到风来。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①火炎：炎热。</p>
<p>②冰兢：冰冷谨慎。在《诗经·小雅·小曼》中有“战战兢兢，如临深渊，如履薄冰”，兢有谨慎惊惧的意思。</p>
<p>③鄙吝：鄙俗，心胸不开阔。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不受人世间各种各样庸俗杂念的影响，心中自然没有炎凉惊惧的感觉。消除心中的卑鄙庸俗，开阔心胸，眼前常见明月，时有清风吹来。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说：“社会是一个大染缸”，身处社会中，人们难免不受社会影响。社会对人的影响有好也有坏，完善自己品行，应尽量减少社会对自己的不良影响。人世间有种种世俗灰尘，人们想一丝一毫都不沾染这种灰尘，这很难做到。沾惹了世俗灰尘，要记得时时清扫。清除身心沾染的世俗灰尘，驱除种种不良卑鄙庸俗的念头。保持身心宁静平和，才会留出时间、保持闲话心境去欣赏清风明月。</p>
<p>陶渊明</p>
<p>人们常常觉得生活中烦恼很多，其实仔细想来，有很多烦恼是由于自己心胸狭窄、争强好胜、贪念过多招惹而来。如果驱除自己身上这些如灰尘污垢般的不良念想，那么人生的烦恼会减少许多。</p>
<p>中国古代有一位非常有名的文人陶渊明，他不为五斗米折腰的气节，他诗中“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”的闲适自在的生活方式，都为历代文人所推崇与向往。陶渊明家中屋旁有五棵柳树，他自号为五柳先生。他不争名利，喜欢读书，嗜好喝酒，在家中种植了许多菊花。每当菊花开放，他一手拿着书，一手拿着酒。对着菊花，饮酒读书，自得其乐。家中穷困，他亲自耕种，过着清贫却自由自在的生活。</p>
<p>虽然向往陶渊明闲适自在生活的人很多，能做到如陶渊明一般不争名夺利、甘于布衣蔬食的却不多。究其原因，多是放不下俗世的追求。我不争权夺利，自然不会为权利之事苦恼；我不过分追求金钱、贪求物质享受，自然也不会为谋财之事苦恼；我不逞强好胜，穷争闲气，也不会为与人斗气之事苦恼；我心胸开阔，不时时猜疑他人，也可省却敏感猜疑之苦恼。如果能放得下，不受俗世牵绊，静下心来，那时会发现生活中原来已存在许多美好事物。心平气和、心无杂念的人，能够看到明月之皎洁华美，能感受阵阵清风之凉爽。</p>
<p>扫去面上甲，涤除胸中尘</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>面上扫开十层甲①，眉目才无可憎；胸中涤去数斗尘②，语言方觉有味。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①甲：指质地坚硬的壳，用在这里比喻人虚伪，用假面具伪装自己。</p>
<p>②尘：灰尘，这里比喻尘世种种不良欲念。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>剥开脸上的层层伪装，露出真面目，这时面貌才不让人讨厌；清除掉心中沾染的各种俗世邪念歪思，话语才会让人觉得真诚有趣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的脸上挂着重重伪装，剥掉一层，还有一层。直到剥开最后一张假面具，露出此人的真面目，那时候这张虚伪的脸才不那么令人讨厌；卑鄙庸俗的人，他们需要狠狠洗涤掉心中隐藏的卑鄙污秽的想法。作者刻画虚伪卑俗之人的面貌，可谓入木三分。</p>
<p>不论身处哪个年代，我们身边似乎从不缺少虚伪卑鄙的人。中国古代有句话“语言无味，面目可憎”，用来形容一个人极其令人厌恶，毫无可爱之处。内心隐藏着污秽邪恶的想法，脸上挂着虚伪的假面具，这样的人确实令人厌恶，避之唯恐不及。稚嫩的小孩子，无论长相如何，都有可爱之处。踏入社会不久的少年，沾惹世俗尘垢少，往往更显真诚可爱。</p>
<p>在社会中为人处事，有时候由于迫不得已，不能把自己的真实性情展现出来。适当隐藏真实自我，这是一种生存之道。如果过分隐藏就成了虚伪，一个人在自己脸上挂上厚厚的假面具，那就只能令人厌恶。虚伪的为人，只能骗过一时，却不能骗过一世。</p>
<p>人们讨厌虚伪世故的人，却往往对于他人的虚伪世故之处看得清楚，对于自己的脸上是否有面具，心中是否有尘垢，却没有认识清楚。修身当时时以他人为镜，照一照自己脸上是否挂着假面具；以他人为戒，时时清除自己心中世故卑鄙的念头。和别人交往，展现出真实的自己，真诚对待别人。真诚的人不会令别人讨厌，真诚的话语不会令人厌恶。</p>
<p>日欺人夜愧，少失志老悲</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>白日欺人，难逃清夜之愧赧①：红颜②失志，空贻③皓首④之悲伤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①愧赧：羞愧脸红。</p>
<p>②红颜：比喻少年。</p>
<p>③贻：留下。</p>
<p>④皓首：白头，指老年。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>白天欺骗了别人，难以逃脱夜深人静独处的时候必然产生的羞愧之感；年少的时候没有立下奋斗志向，到年老的时候就会因为白头却无所成就而悲伤。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>白天欺骗了别人，到夜深人静自己一个人独处的时候，禁不住会产生羞愧的感觉；少年的时候没有奋斗志向，虚度大好光阴，到年纪大了的时候，会因为一事无成而感到后悔悲伤。</p>
<p>就白天欺骗别人夜晚羞愧而言，其实对于不同的人而言，情况是不同的。在这个世界上，也许有些人正因为白天欺骗了别人，取得了自己想要的东西，夜晚想起时沾沾自喜、大为得意，而根本不会感到羞愧。对于那些本性存有良知的人而言，如果做了有愧于自己良心的事情，欺骗别人却难以逃脱自己良心的拷问。因此我们当以此为戒，坦诚对待别人，不做有愧于良心的事情。年轻的时候，我们总以为自己有很多时间，在忙忙碌碌中虚度了一生的光阴。等到头发白了，再也不能做事情的时候，才开始后悔这一生白白浪费，一事无成。那个时候空留下一腔悔恨，却于事无补。想到这里，不禁令人胆寒。因此在我们年少时，应该为自己立下奋斗目标，坚定不移地付出努力去实现这个目标。同时相信，无论什么时候努力奋斗都不会晚，不要以自己的年龄为障碍挡住自己前进的脚步。</p>
<p>毛泽东在少年时，就立下了改变中国命运的奋斗目标，一生坚定不移为实现这个目标而奋斗。他留给了父亲一张纸条，上面写道：孩儿立志出乡关，学不成名誓不还。埋骨何须桑梓地，人生无处不青山。这首赠给父亲的诗，表明了毛泽东探索真理，胸怀天下，立志有所作为的志向。此后毛泽东为探索真理，为实现中华强盛，克服各种困难，不断奋斗，实现了自己年少时立下的志向。</p>
<p>另一位伟人周恩来，在少年时也立下了伟大志向。那时他12岁，在一次修身课上，一位姓魏的校长为同学们讲解“立命”一节。校长问大家说：各位同学们，你们为什么而读书呢？同学的答案五花八门。有的说为了做官读书，有的回答为父母亲读书，有的说为生活读书。老校长看到周恩来，就问他为什么来读书。周恩来用清晰的声音回答：“我为中华之崛起而读书！”听了这话，老校长十分激动，他没有想到一个才12岁的孩子居然有这样远大的志向。周恩来的一生，也正是顽强奋斗，为实现自己少年时立下的志向不断拼搏的一生。</p>
<p>养性即立命，尽人自回天</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>执拗①者福轻，而圆融②之人其禄必厚；操切③者寿夭④，而宽厚之士其年必长。故君子不言命，养性即所以立命；亦不言天，尽人自可以回天。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①执拗：固执。</p>
<p>②圆融：不偏执，圆通。</p>
<p>③操切：急躁，做事时急躁严厉。</p>
<p>④寿夭：短命，寿命不长。夭：夭折，没有成年就死去了。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>性格过于偏执任性的人福气少，性格圆通不固执的人福禄多；性格急躁严厉的人寿命短，性格宽厚温和的人寿命必然长。所以君子不说命，修身养性就是立命：君子也不谈论天，做好自己责任内的事情，就可以挽回天命。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>喜欢固执己见，性格偏执任性的人，福气也相应少；性格圆通不固执的人，福禄也必然多。性格急躁，对待自己与对待他人都同样严厉的人，寿命必然不会长久；性格宽厚温和，对人宽容的人寿命也必然长。在现实生活中，这样的事例确实不少。</p>
<p>在众多历史演义小说以及评书中，秦琼都是一位英雄，但他在英雄榜上排名不在最前面。李元霸与裴元庆以及秦琼的表弟罗成都排在秦琼前面。还有另一位福将程咬金，据说他的本事只有三招，三板斧使完之后就再没有其他招数。从英雄榜排名来看，比秦琼与程咬金武功高强的大有人在。但是到尘埃落定大唐建立之时，秦琼与程咬金这两位却成为耀眼的功臣，英雄榜上数一数二的英雄反而早已烟消云散。这当然是由很多因素造成的。但是性格执拗与圆融，性格操切与宽厚却是一个很重要的影响因素。李元霸与裴元庆以及罗成，俱是本领大脾气也大的人。他们性格操切急躁，容易固执己见，常恃才傲物，不能圆融处事待人。最终这些英才多早逝，福禄不厚，寿命小长。秦琼与程咬金虽然不是本领最大之人，却最终建功立业，安享天年。</p>
<p>因此君子不需要谈天论命，窥测天命如何。只要修身养性，宽厚温和待人处事，不要执拗固执，就可以立命了。属于自己应该做的事情，一定要做好，忠实履行自己的职责，这样就可以顺应天命。古人中有许多相信只要人多行好事，努力完善自己的品行，就可以使天命改变。例如拾金不昧、不拆散别人家庭、接济鳏寡孤独等，这样做往往会使人改变自己的命运。例如某人本来没有状元的命，但是由于他做了许多好事，上天就让他中了状元。这种说法虽然是因果报应论，但是对于我们而言也有借鉴作用。虽然未来命运不可以预测，但是我们可以把握好现在，尽职尽责做好自己的事情。</p>
<p>得意处水月，拂意时火莲</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>得意处论地谈天，俱是水底捞月；拂意①时吞冰啮雪，才为火内栽莲②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①拂意：不顺心，不顺意。</p>
<p>②火内栽莲：烈火中种莲花，比喻身体虽然受烈火锤炼，却依然能坚持自我。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>得意的时候谈天说地，都如水底捞月般虚幻不真实；在不顺自己心意的逆境中，吃冰咽雪，经受这样艰苦锤炼，才能如烈火中莲花一般真实可贵。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在一切顺利的时候，高谈阔论，都如水中捞取月亮一般不真实，得不到实在的修行。在身处逆境的时候，经受各种苦难锤炼，就如烈火中栽种莲花，这个时候才能获得真正的进步。吃得苦中苦，方能成就一番事业。无论是修养自己德行，还是求学工作，都需要有这种认识。</p>
<p>身处顺境，吃饱喝足之后，发一番感慨，说一通道理，这种言论并没有真正认识人生，无助于取得真正的成功。真正的成功，只有经历一番艰苦锤炼之后才能取得；人生的真味，只有经历一番艰苦锤炼之后才能体悟。</p>
<p>有一句成语叫“闻鸡起舞”，说的是东晋时期，有一位叫祖逖的人。他是一位有志气的青年，看到国家处于分裂局面，便决心收复国家失地。为了实现这个目标，他每天早上一听到公鸡叫就立刻起床。起床之后，他便拔剑练习武功，准备将来为国家效力。无论酷暑寒冬，公鸡第一次打鸣，他便起床。就这样，他一直坚持不懈闻鸡起舞，终于练成了一身好本领。后来祖逖在几年之内，收复了大部分领土。虽然由于东晋政府的压制，他没有实现恢复中原的目标。但是祖逖为报效国家，闻鸡起舞苦练武功的事迹，一直为后代称颂。无论做什么事情，都需要有这种吃苦精神，有不怕受烈火锤炼的坚强意志，这样才能有所收获。</p>
<p>得意时候，所得认识见解不过是水中月、镜中花，美丽却不真实，虚幻的美丽经不住时间的考验。只有在经历失意、经历艰难困苦、经历逆境折磨之后，这时的认识才是真实的，是能经受住时间考验的真知。</p>
<p>君子明心事，君子韬才华</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>君子之心事，天青白日①，不可使人不知；君子之才华，玉韫珠藏②，不可使人易知。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①天青白日：青天白日，比喻君子心胸坦荡。</p>
<p>②玉韫珠藏：像收藏珠玉宝物那样收藏才华。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>君子的心事，就如青天白日那样坦荡明朗，要让别人知道自己的心事；君子的才华，应像珍藏珠玉宝物那样收藏，不能轻易让别人知晓。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>君子心胸坦荡明朗，心中所思所想，应该让别人知道。如果把自己的心思隐藏起来，别人猜不透你在想什么，那么怀疑猜忌就可能产生。对方如果是品行优良的正人君子，那么他小会以阴暗心理猜忌你；假如对方是卑鄙小人，那么他很可能会以龌龊心思怀疑你。为避免这些不必要的猜忌与怀疑，应该使自己的心事坦白明朗，那样猜忌怀疑也就自然消失。才华横溢的人容易引起别人羡慕，这种羡慕在某些情形下可能转化为嫉妒。因此为免去不必要的是非，君子应当将自己的才华珍藏起一部分。</p>
<p>横竿晴翠图</p>
<p>有这样一个历史故事，叫“青梅煮酒论英雄”。说的是东汉末年，群雄纷起争天下。刘备有志于恢复汉室，重振朝纲，但是他力量薄弱，不得已投奔曹操。曹操待刘备不错，但曹操多疑，他猜到刘备有夺天下的志向。有一天曹操请刘备见面，刘备心怀不安，不知道曹操有什么意图。虽然心中忐忑不安，但是刘备没有表现出来，他从容地去见曹操。曹操备下了美酒与青梅，请刘备喝酒。两个人边喝酒边聊天，谈论起天下英雄。曹操对刘备说，天下只有两个英雄，那就是你和我。听了这话，刘备大吃一惊，手中筷子一下子掉在地上。恰好此时，有一阵雷声响起。刘备趁机说这雷声真有威力，让我把筷子都掉地上了。刘备假借雷声掩饰了被曹操识破心事的震惊。曹操大笑说大丈夫怎么也会怕雷声。刘备说圣人在这种情况下神色也会发生变化，我怎么能不怕呢。曹操于是不再怀疑刘备。身处乱世之中，有远大志向的刘备，遇见多疑的曹操，不仅不炫耀自己的才能，更是将自己心中的抱负隐藏起来。这样才能避免曹操的猜忌，保全自身。当刘备遇见诸葛亮时，刘备将自己的远大志向，毫无保留全部告诉诸葛亮。因此君子的心胸坦荡与珍藏才华，也要区分不同情势。有些情况下才华心事都得藏起来，有些情况下心事与才华可以全盘托出。还有一种情况就是使人明白自己的心事，但是将自己的才华珍藏起不使别人完全了解。</p>
<p>真味只是淡，至人只是常</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>①肥②辛甘非真味，真味只是淡；神奇卓异非至人③，至人只是常。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①：这里指酒味醇厚。</p>
<p>②肥：肥美的食物。</p>
<p>③至人：道德修养达到完善境界的人。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>醇厚的美酒、肥美的食物、辛辣与甘甜的食品，这些都不是真正的美味，人世间真正的美味是清淡的；言行举止怪异的人，不是真正有德行的人，真正有德行的人表现与平常人一样。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>各种刺激性的味道并不是最真实的味道，最清淡的味道恰恰才是最美妙的味道。各种辛辣刺激的美食，能满足人一时口腹之欲，却使人肠胃受损。清淡的食物，滋味虽然淡，却有益于人身体。神奇怪异的人不是真正有德行的人，真正完美无缺的伟人，表现恰恰很平凡。正是在平凡之中，蕴藏着不平凡。</p>
<p>有一次有人对孟子说：“齐王总是派人去拜访先生，想必先生一定有与别人不同的地方吧。”孟子回答说：“没有什么与别人不相同的地方，就是尧舜也和普通人一样。”孟子这句话说得很妙，大家都是人，没有什么不同。就是尧舜这样有德行的君主，也是人罢了，看起来也和普通人没什么两样。</p>
<p>平凡的人在平凡的生活中实现自己不平凡的理想。华罗庚是我国著名的数学家，他小时候家里很穷，没有钱读书，自学成才。年轻时的华罗庚，喜欢研究数学问题。某一天他读了当时一位著名教授写的论文，发现这篇论文中有错误。于是华罗庚写了一篇文章寄给《科学》杂志，指出了著名教授论文中的错误。华罗庚写的这篇论文，被清华大学数学系主任看到，他非常欣赏华罗庚的才华，邀请华罗庚来清华大学数学系讲课。当华罗庚应邀来到清华大学数学系时，大家都有一点吃惊。没想到这样年轻有才华的人，看起来如此普通，身体还有一点残疾。就是这样一位看起来普普通通的人，后来成为中国著名数学家。因此修养身心，不要追逐新奇怪异，不要崇拜那些看起来与众不同新奇怪异的人。最平淡的味道恰恰是人生真味，伟大不平凡的人恰恰是那些看起来非常平凡的人。</p>
<p>正气还天地，清名在乾坤</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>宁守浑噩①而黜②聪明，留些正气还天地；宁谢③纷华而甘淡泊，遗个清名④在乾坤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①浑噩：浑厚朴实。</p>
<p>②黜：抛弃。</p>
<p>③谢：推辞，不要。</p>
<p>④清名：好名声。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>宁可保持着浑厚纯朴的天性而抛弃奸诈虚伪心机，留下一些正气还给天地；宁可远离繁华而甘于淡泊，留下清白的名声在天地之间。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>与虚伪奸诈比起来，纯真朴实更为可贵；与奢侈享受的生活比起来，清白的名声更值得追求。为留一个好名声，甘于粗茶淡饭的生活。天汉元年（公元前100年），两汉大臣苏武出使匈奴，被扣留。匈奴贵族多次威逼利诱，想使苏武投降，苏武坚决不答应。单于又羞又恼，下命令让人把苏武关在地窖中，不给他食物与水。冰冷的天气里，苏武吞咽着雪块。几天后，匈奴发现他还没有死，十分惊奇。单于令苏武到北海边上放羊，并说等到苏武放养的这群公羊生小羊的时候，才放苏武回去。就这样，苏武一直放养着这群羊。没有吃的东西，他就到处找些野果子、草根等东西来充饥。一边是荣华富贵，一边是穷愁困苦的生活，他选择了甘受穷困折磨。苏武被匈奴扣留十九年后，终于回到自己的故乡。他从一个黑发人变成白发老人，受尽折磨，却始终不改其志，未曾向匈奴投降。苏武这种气节，为后世人所称颂。</p>
<p>南宋末年，文天祥被元军俘虏，元朝皇帝派人劝他投降，许诺如果他投降元朝，给予他高官厚禄。文天祥身心忍受各种磨难，却坚持自己的信念不动摇，决不投降元朝。他写了这样一首诗：“辛苦遭逢起一经，干戈寥落四周星。山河破碎风飘絮，身世浮沉雨打萍。惶恐滩头说惶恐，零丁洋里叹零丁。人生自古谁无死？留取丹心照汗青。”这首诗与文天祥这个名字载入史册，千百年来激励了无数的仁人志士。</p>
<p>人人大慈悲，处处真趣味</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人人有个大慈悲①，维摩②屠刽③无二心也；处处有种真趣味，金屋④茅檐⑤非两地也。只是欲闭情封，当面错过，便咫尺千里矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①大慈悲：佛家语，给他人带来快乐叫慈，为他人消除痛苦叫悲。</p>
<p>②维摩：维摩诘的简称，菩萨名。</p>
<p>③屠刽：屠夫，刽子手。</p>
<p>④金屋：华丽的屋子。</p>
<p>⑤茅檐：茅草屋。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>每一个人都有慈悲之心，就这一点来说，大慈大悲的维摩诘菩萨与屠夫刽子手是没有分别的。到处都有生活情趣，就此而言，华丽的房屋与简陋的茅草屋也没有什么分别。只是由于人心常被各种欲念情感封闭，因此与慈悲、真趣味只在咫尺之间，却当面错过，远隔千里了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>本段讲的是人性是善良的，每个人心中都有慈悲之念。即使是屠夫刽子手这样凶恶的人，心中也存有善念。中国古代有主张人性本善的，也有主张人性本恶的。如孟子主张人性本善，他说：“人皆有恻隐之心，是非之心，辞让之心，羞恶之心。”荀子主张人性本恶，他说：“人之性恶，其善者伪也，”关于人本性是善还是恶，这个问题引起很多争论。无论是人性本善还是人性本恶，我们修身养性应该挖掘培养自己的同情心。因为没有同情心，不能善待他人的社会是没有发展前途的社会。</p>
<p>生活情趣随处可见，无论是居住在华美屋子里的人，还是居住在茅草屋里的人，都能享受生活情趣。生活的趣味不由掌握多少财富决定，一个在物质上非常富有的人也许在生活中根本找不到什么趣味。</p>
<p>华罗庚年轻时生活非常清贫。当时他在西南联大当老师，有一次，附近的老乡送给华罗庚妻子两颗鸡蛋。华罗庚妻子吴筱元拿了这两颗鸡蛋，偷偷留了一颗给丈夫。当孩子们都睡着了，她悄悄煮熟鸡蛋给华罗庚吃。华罗庚看到鸡蛋，问妻子道：“一个鸡蛋重半两，把它平均分成五份，每份重多少？”吴筱元笑着回答：“这么简单的题也考我，每份重0.1两。”华罗庚把鸡蛋平均分成五份，自己吃掉一份，剩下的四份留给妻子与孩子。华罗庚一家，生活虽然清贫，却生活得很有情趣。</p>
<p>年少时候的曹雪芹，家门显赫，过着锦衣玉食的生活。家庭发生变故之后，他的生活境况愈来愈差。到晚年的时候，他过着穷困潦倒的生活。就是在这样的生活环境中，他写出了伟大的文学名著《红楼梦》。在这样的生活环境中，他教给邻居中没有生活来源的人扎风筝，以便于将来他们能借此手艺赚一点钱糊口。善良与有无生活情趣不由你掌握多少物质财富决定。曹雪芹在过着锦衣玉食的生活时，有生活情趣；当他家道败落时，他依然能在贫困的生活中找到一些生活乐趣。</p>
<p>慈悲之心与善良之念，如果你肯挖掘培养，那么人人皆有善良的一面。生活情趣与拥有多少物质财富无关。一个一无所有的乞丐同样能欣赏似锦繁花和明媚春光。</p>
<p>无得罪昭昭，无得罪冥冥</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>肝受病则目不能视，肾受病则耳不能听。病受于人所不见，必发于人所共见。故君子欲无得罪于昭昭①，必先无得罪于冥冥②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①昭昭：明亮可见。</p>
<p>②冥冥：昏暗不清楚。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人的肝脏有了病，眼睛就会看不清东西，肾脏有了病，耳朵就会听不清楚声音。疾病生在人看不见的地方，而在人都能看得见的地方发作。因此君子想要在大家都能看得见的地方不犯错误，首先在人看不见的地方端正自己的言行。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>身体疾病生长在人所看不见的地方，发作的时候却在大家都能看得到的地方。俗话说“天网恢恢疏而不漏”，不要以为自己私下做的事情可以瞒过众人眼睛。常言道“要想人不知，除非己莫为”，暗地里做的事情，总有一天会暴露在阳光之下。别人都不知道的事情，还有天知与地知。黑暗与隐秘的环境里，在别人看不见听不到的情况下，更不应该做见不得人的坏事。在没有人监督的情况下，更应该严格要求自己。</p>
<p>东汉时有一位叫杨震的官吏，他博览群书，通晓经典，很有才华，有“关西孔子”的美誉。他为官洁身自好，忠贞清廉，生活十分俭朴。他当官不给自己置办产业，不建造豪华府邸，甘于布衣蔬食。他到东莱出任太守，路过叫昌邑的地方。当时任昌邑县令的是一个叫王密的人，此人曾经受过杨震的举荐，对杨震心怀感激之情。为报答杨震以前对自己的举荐之恩，他准备了10斤黄金，趁着夜深人静的时候带着黄金到驿馆献给杨震。杨震对王密这样做非常生气，他说：“我了解你，你怎么一点都不了解我？”王密还以为杨震是怕人知道，因而不肯接受黄金。他再次请杨震收下黄金，并说：“天黑，没有人知道。”杨震说：“天知，地知，你知，我知，怎么说没有人知道呢？”王密这才明白杨震的真正意思，感到十分羞愧。有人在旁监督，言行举止表现很好，这不足为奇。当没有人监督时依然能坚持自律，不去做违反法律道德的事情，这才可贵。儒家讲慎独，就是说在没有旁人监督，自己一个人独处时更要严格要求自身，决不做见不得光的事情。</p>
<p>有一个女推销员挨家挨户推销护肤品，有一家女主人看中了一个眼霜。她问眼霜多少钱，推销员说60元。女主人还价50元。女推销员不肯卖，她说公司里规定卖60元。女主人说50元卖，我买你三件，你还有赚头，不要给公司里知道就行了。女推销员犹豫了一下，还是拒绝了。公司规定每个眼霜卖60元，40元付给公司，剩下20元归推销员所有。卖出的东西多，公司里还有奖励。每个眼霜卖50元，她也还能赚10元。当时她非常需要钱，找了好长时间工作。但规定就是规定，不能只在有人监督时才遵守规定，即使骗得过公司，她也骗不过自己。不在冥冥之中做见不得光的事情，才能坦然走在阳光之下。</p>
<p>苦心常悦心，得意生失意</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>苦心①中常得悦心②之趣，得意时便生失意之悲。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①苦心：伤心痛苦。</p>
<p>②悦心：心情愉悦。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>伤心痛苦的时候，要保持快乐喜悦的趣味，使自己身心愉悦。一切顺利的时候，要想到失意遇挫时的痛苦悲伤。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>生活艰难困苦的时候，不要再自己给自己施加压力，这个时候应该保持身心愉快，适当娱乐，使自己能得到放松。要相信生活中的困难是能够克服的，道路虽然曲折，但前途是光明的。张弛有度，既不能使精神过于放松，也不能使自己的神经绷得太紧。</p>
<p>有一个记者到生活在贫困线以下的家庭采访，这个家庭是单亲家庭，男主人几年前因病去世，看病住院花掉许多钱。他们家庭本来就不宽裕，这一来还欠了债。女主人是一个女工，有两个孩子，都在上学。一家三口都靠着她那点工资过活，还要还债，生活过得很清贫。当记者见到女主人时，却吃了一惊。通常情况下，处于这种境况下的家庭，难免有些愁苦之气，但是这个家庭却不是这样。女主人脸上总浮现着笑容，爽快明朗。家里虽然没有很多家具，而且很多是别人不用的旧家具，却打扫得十分干净，布置得十分整洁。有许多小物件都是女主人自己动手做的，用的原材料都是不值钱的旧东西。孩子们也都很乖，懂事体贴母亲。他们有时候会全家一同出去，逛书店游公园，总能找到一些生活乐趣。</p>
<p>身处顺境，正逢得意之时，不要忘乎所以，要时常想到失意之时的悲伤与痛苦。俗话说“人无千日好，花无百日红”，人的一生不可能总是处于顺境，在得意时常想想失意时的痛苦，这样可以使人保持冷静清晰的头脑。赵小兰是美国历史上首位华裔内阁成员。她为在美华人参政树立了新的里程碑。赵小兰的成功得益于良好的家教。刚到美国的时候，赵家生活过得很艰难，后来赵家富裕起来，一些良好的生活习惯却依然保留下来。赵家姐妹几个都不乱花钱，热爱劳动。家中虽有管家，孩子们依然自己洗衣服，自己动手打扫房间。学习之余，孩子们还要分担一部分家务，清除游泳池里的脏东西，整理草坪，甚至自己动手铺路。每当赵小兰工作压力大，感觉非常累的时候，她经常会看一张照片。这张照片是她与父亲回上海时，在赵家旧居前拍摄的。照片的背景是破旧的茅草屋，她常想：“父亲能在这样艰苦的条件下成功，我还有什么困难不能克服呢？”每当她取得成绩时，她亦提醒自己不可骄傲忘形。</p>
<p>苦与乐是一对矛盾，有苦必有乐，有乐也必然有苦。得意与失意同样也是共生的关系，人生有得意时，也不可避免会有不如意的时候。身处乐境中，不可得意忘形；身处逆境中，也不可萎靡不振。</p>
<p>真廉无廉名，大巧无巧术</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>真廉无廉①名，立名者正所以为贪；大巧②无巧术，用术者乃所以为拙。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①廉：廉洁。</p>
<p>②大巧：大智慧。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个真正廉洁的人没有廉洁的名声，为自己树立廉洁名声的人，正是贪图廉洁的名声才这样做；真正有大智慧的人不会卖弄小聪明，玩弄小伎俩、耍小聪明的人，其实是为了掩饰他们的笨拙无知。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>真正清廉的人，不会刻意树立廉洁的名声。树立一个廉洁的名声，正是贪恋名声的做法。清廉是君子应当具有的品德，保持清廉是君子应当做的事情。特意为自己树立一个清廉的好名声，这还是看重虚名而不是更看重实际的做法。看重虚名超过实际，这是被真君子所鄙视的。真正廉洁的人把保持清廉作为自己分内之事，看成是自己的责任与义务，不会特意为自己树立一个清廉的名声，惹来沽名钓誉的嫌疑。当今社会，有些人在活着的时候我们并没有听说他们的清廉事迹，而当这些人去世之后，他们清廉的名声传播开来，各种赞美荣誉也纷纷跟着而来。人们也许会想在这些人活着的时候，为什么不多给他们一些荣誉与奖励，非要等他们离开人世间了才给死者加冕，是不是为时已晚？其实换一个角度想这个问题，我们或许能得出不同结论。这些人之所以在生前默默无闻，恰恰是他们在默默奋斗，尽职尽责履行自己的义务，默默做好自己的事情。他们不贪虚名，不会花心思花时间为自己树立良好名声。</p>
<p>午苑风和</p>
<p>真正具有大智慧的人，不会去玩弄机巧，不会耍一些小聪明骗人。《红楼梦》中有一位非常聪明的女人王熙凤，她的聪明不只是小聪明那么简单，她确实很有才干。文中借仆人之口说她口才非常好，十个会说的男人都说不过她一个。管理家事，讨老祖宗贾母喜欢，这些事她都做得很好。她很会活跃气氛，她讲笑话时小丫头们都呼朋唤友赶快来听。就是这样一个聪明人，十二金钗的判词里说她“机关算尽太聪明，反算了卿卿性命”。她确实聪明，只是她的聪明多用在怎么样算计别人，怎么样为自己捞取更多金银珠宝上。用各种巧术算计别人，最终自己也不会有什么善果。真正有智慧的人是不会用机巧算计别人的，俗话说“大智若愚”，真聪明的人有时宁可吃一些小亏，而不是要处处争先，占尽别人便宜。</p>
<p>天理路上宽，人欲路上窄</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天理①路上甚宽，稍游心②，胸中使觉广大宏朗；人欲③路上甚窄，才寄迹④，眼前俱是荆棘泥涂⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①天理：自然法则。</p>
<p>②游心：动心。</p>
<p>③人欲：人的欲望。</p>
<p>④寄迹：涉足，踏入。</p>
<p>⑤荆棘泥涂：荆棘阻塞道路，泥泞的道路难以行走，形容道路难走。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>真理大道十分宽广，只要人们能在这上面稍微用些心思，就会觉得心胸开阔、光明敞亮。欲望之路十分狭窄，人刚踏出一步，就会觉得面前都是荆棘与泥泞，简直是寸步难行。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>追求真理的道理十分宽广，相反欲望之路就十分狭窄。人生在世如白驹过隙，是抓紧时间及时享乐还是追求光明真理，这全在个人选择。真理的道路会越走越宽，是一条走向光明的道路；相反欲望之路则会越走越窄，到最后简直寸步难行。因为人的欲望是无穷无尽的，有了金想得银，有了绸缎衣服又想念貂裘，鸡鸭鱼肉吃厌又想着鱼翅燕窝。不控制自己的各种欲望，只是一味顺应自己的欲望，这样只会使自己的人生道路越走越窄，严重的总有一天会走向绝路。人的欲望不仅表现在对物质生活的追求上，也表现在其他很多方面。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是有一位叫张旭的有为青年，他各方面表现都很出色，只有一个缺点。他喜欢抽烟，烟瘾非常大，一直戒不了烟。有一天晚上，他到外地去出差，住在一个偏僻的旅店里。走时比较匆忙，他没来得及买烟，他随身带的烟都被他抽光了。这时候天下起雨来，雨很大，外面一片漆黑。旅店里不卖烟，他要想买烟得到外面去。旅店附近没有超市也没有小商店，最近的一家超市，步行走过去大概得半个小时。他的烟瘾犯了，坐卧不宁，干什么都觉得不能集中精神。他被自己的烟瘾驱使，穿上外衣，穿上鞋，带着雨具，推门出去买烟。但是当他站在茫茫雨中时，忽然停住了，他问自己：“我这是在做什么？”他一个成熟有理智的青年，在一个大雨夜，被自己的烟瘾驱使，冒着雨也要去买烟。为什么要被自己的欲望驱使？他想如果我不能在抽烟上控制我自己，那么当我在别的事情上遇见困难、面对诱惑时又怎么能控制自己？一个理智健全的人是不应该被自己的欲望驱使，屈从于自己的欲望的，他这样想后，转身回到自己的房间里，安稳入睡。</p>
<p>正如故事中张旭自己对自己说的话，一个人不应该受自己欲望的驱使。不能控制欲望，放纵自己跟着欲望走，最终只能沦为自己欲望的奴隶。相反追求真理则会使人路越走越宽，前途越来越光明。</p>
<p>一起欲便觉，一觉便转念</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>念头起处①，才觉向欲路上去，便挽②从理路上来；一起便觉，一觉便转，此是转祸为福、起死回生的关头，切莫当面错过。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①念头起处：念头产生的地方。</p>
<p>②挽：拉。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当心中念头产生时，只要一察觉这念头是走向欲望之路的，就立刻把这念头拉回正道上来。欲念刚一产生就立刻发觉，一发觉就立刻把念头转到正路上来，这是把祸害变为福气、起死回生的关键时刻，万万不可轻易错过时机。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“一失足成千古恨，再回首已百年身”，人生在世总有一些时候是非常关键的，总有一些选择是至关重要的。如果没有把握住机会，没有做出正确的选择，那么很可能会铸成大错，造成一失足成千古恨的遗憾局面。许多事情往往在我们一念之间就已经决定了我们人生，因此要慎重选择，谨慎下决定。如何才能使自己的选择与决定更正确，更符合自己的意志，避免轻率与不理智，使自己将来不后悔？这就需要平时就培养成克制自己的好习惯，无论做什么事情都要仔细思考，想一想自己的念头想法是不是合理，是不是邪念欲念，如果是通向欲望之路的念头，那就一定要消除。凡事三思，谨慎决定，时时刻刻提醒自己保持理智，不要堕入欲望的深渊，这样就可以使我们少犯些错误，少些事后悔。</p>
<p>有一个小男孩脾气非常暴躁，喜欢打架，一句话不投机就能和人打起来。有些被他欺负过的孩子，他们家长找到他父母，要他父母管管自己的孩子。男孩的父亲把他带到后院，问他为什么喜欢欺负别的小孩，为什么喜欢打架。这个男孩子回答说他自己也知道打架欺负人不对，不过有些时候他就是管不住自己的脾气，事后他也很后悔。孩子的父亲指着一块木板对孩子说如果他管不住自己脾气，那么不要向别人发火，可以到这块木板上刻字，直到他脾气消失。小男孩听了父亲的建议之后，每当和别人斗气要发火时，他努力克制自己，实在忍不住就回家刻字。在刻好几个字之后，他的怒气也就渐渐消失了。用这种方法，男孩渐渐控制了自己的脾气，不再轻易对别人发火。</p>
<p>控制自己，不使自己堕入欲望的深渊，这不仅需要清醒的认识，更需要有坚强的意志力。有的人意志力天生比较强，有些人意志力可能相对差一些。意志力比较薄弱的人，可以通过自我训练来磨练意志力，使得自己的意志力变得更坚强。</p>
<p>天命又如何，人定能胜天</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天薄①我以福，吾厚吾德以迓之②；天劳我以形，吾逸③吾心以补之；天厄④我以遇，吾亨吾道以通之。天且奈我何哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①薄：减少。</p>
<p>②迓之：迎接它。迓，迎接的意思。</p>
<p>③逸：放松，安闲。</p>
<p>④厄：困厄，压抑。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>如果上天给我的福分很少，那么我就多做好事、积善行德，以此来对待命运；如果上天劳苦我的身体，那么我就使我的心灵保持清闲安逸，以此来弥补我身体上的困乏；如果上天用困苦折磨我、使我不能得到很好发展，那么我开辟一条道路走出困境。如果我能这样做，上天又能拿我怎么样呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>生活中，人与人之间避免不了会进行比较。有时候我们可能会感叹为什么别人的运气那么好，别人那么有福气，别人活得那么安闲自在。美国总统艾森豪威尔年轻时，有一次家里来了几个客人。晚饭之后，客人与家里人一起打牌。小艾森豪威尔接连抓到坏牌，非常不高兴，不停抱怨自己的运气差。他妈妈注视着他，但是没有说什么。等客人走后，他妈妈很认真地对他说：如果你要玩牌，就必须用你抓到的牌玩下去，不要管那些牌是好还是坏。人生也是这样的，人生的牌是由上帝来发，不管怎么样的牌你都必须接受，你不能改变牌的好坏，你所能做的就是全力以赴，争取尽可能好的结果。母亲这些话对艾森豪威尔影响很大，多年以后他一直保持积极乐观的人生态度。对于我们平常人来说，一生也会遭遇各种风风雨雨，会有风平浪静的顺境，也会有波涛汹涌的逆境；既有成功的喜悦，也会有失败的痛苦。这些事情如果我们能以一颗平常心对待，那么也就能保持内心平静，遇到事情不怨天尤人，而是以积极乐观的心态去积极面对。</p>
<p>孟子曾经说过：“故天将降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为，所以动心忍性，曾益其所不能。”也就是说天要将重大的使命交给某人，那么必定先要使他身心困苦，筋骨劳累，忍饥挨饿，做事情总是不能如意。用这些来磨炼他的身心，使他养成坚忍自控的品性，增加他的本事。艰难困苦是锻炼人的火炉，经过它的锤炼之后，那就像从太上老君的炼丹炉里出来的齐天大圣孙悟空，比从前本领更加高强。</p>
<p>有人说上天对每个人都是公平的，也有人说上天根本就不公平。不论上天对我们怎么样，我们能做的不是怨天尤人，不是坐以待毙，而是积极乐观地对待人生，对待天命，相信人定能胜天命，天命不足惧怕。</p>
<p>天之机权神，人之智巧拙</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>贞士①无心徼福②，天即就无心处牖③其衷④；险人⑤著意避祸，天即就著意处夺其魄。可见天之机权⑥最神，人之智巧何益！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①贞士：有坚定气节的人。</p>
<p>②徼福：祈福。徼，同邀。《左传·僖公》中说：“君惠徼福于敝邑之社稷，辱收寡君。”</p>
<p>③牖：开启，诱导。</p>
<p>④衷：衷心。</p>
<p>⑤险人：奸险邪恶行为不正的小人。险，邪佞。</p>
<p>⑥机权：灵活变化。机，灵巧。权，变通。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个有气节的君子，虽然没有想为自己祈求福祉，但是老天却在他不留心的地方启发他完成自己的事业，使他获得福分；一个奸诈邪恶的人，虽然费尽心机想逃避灾祸，但是老天却在他巧用心机时夺走他的魂魄，使他遭受灾害。由此可见，上天的灵活变化最神奇，人的平凡智慧怎么能比得上呢！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>中国有句古话说：“人算不如天算”有时候人们竭尽全力，谋划得十分圆满，怎奈何总有意外打破自己的计划。有时上天最冷酷无情，人类祈求幸福，祈求避免灾祸，这些祈求它统统置之不理。如何对待天命，祈求与用尽心机都不是好办法。顺应自然，做好自己的事情，成为一个有德行的人，这样往往就可以获得意想不到的福分，避开祸患。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是古时候有一个商人，他到外地去贩卖货物，在一条僻静的小路上发现一个布包。商人捡起这个布包，打开一看，竟然是几锭光灿灿的银子，成色非常好。商人十分高兴，他想这真是上天赐给我的福分啊。他正打算携带银子离开，转念一想，我捡到银子如此高兴，可是那丢银子的人不知道如何沮丧。如果是一个富人丢了这银子也还罢了，如果是一个家境不富裕的人丢了这银子不知道该如何着急。商人这样一想，就没打算走了。他留在原地一直等，等到太阳快下山了才看到一个妇人急急忙忙赶来。她一路上只管低着头看东看西，商人猜这个妇人可能就是失主。等到妇人走近来，他问她是不是在找一个布包。妇人连忙点头说是，她心存希望问商人是不是看到一个布包。商人就问这个妇人布包的样子，以及里面装了什么东西。妇人一一回答，商人听她描述一番，确定自己捡的包就是这个妇人的。于是商人就把这个包还给妇人了，妇人非常感激商人，说她家贫，这些银子是有急用的，因为丈夫有事情分不开身，只好由她出面去办事。如果这些银子找不到了，妇人说她也不能活了，她打算投河自尽。她说商人是她的救命恩人，问商人住在哪里，她要和丈夫去拜谢恩人一家。商人说不用了，自己是远方来此贩卖货物的，只在旅店里落脚。商人和妇人分别后，就赶快往前走找旅店投宿。这时候天色已晚，各家旅店多已客满，商人找了半天没有找到空房间。最后店伙计把他安排到一间破败不堪的房子里，商人因为天色已晚，也就不计较那么多了。商人走了一天路，躺下很快就睡着了，正睡着突然听到有人来敲门。商人很不情愿地披衣起床开门，开门一看，门外站着一男一女。那女子正是白天自己归还她银子的妇人。她说男子是他丈夫，两人怕商人走了不好寻找，因此特地深夜赶来道谢。商人看到他们手中提着一些点心糕饼，正要说何必这么客气的时候，突然听到身后一声巨响，一堵墙倒塌，正好压在商人睡过的床上。三个人都惊呆了，明白过来时，商人向夫妻两人道谢，说现在二位是我的救命恩人。</p>
<p>看人后半截，晚节不可丧</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>声妓①晚景从良②，一世之烟花③无碍；贞妇白头失守，半生之清苦俱非。语云：“看人只看后半截”，真名言也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①声妓：本指古代宫廷贵族家中蓄养的歌舞女，此处指妓女。</p>
<p>②从良：古代妓女隶属于乐籍，从良就是脱离乐户嫁人。</p>
<p>③烟花：代指妓女，此处指妓女生涯。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>妓女以卖笑为生，如果到了晚年能够脱离卖笑生活，从良嫁人，那么她从前的妓女生涯也就不是大过错了；一个贞洁的妇人，到了晚年失去贞洁，那么她大半辈子坚守贞操、吃苦守寡的辛苦也就白费了。俗话说：“评论一个人的品行，关键是看他能不能守住晚节。”这真是一句至理名言啊。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>少年人犯了错误，往往容易得到世人的原谅。俗话说“年少无知”，因为年少对世界认识不是那么深刻，难免会犯这样或那样的错误。少年人有错不怕，只要能改过来就好。相比之下，一个成熟有理智的人突然由正人君子变成卑鄙小人，则往往不那么容易得到世人的原谅。孔子说“三十而立、四十不惑、五十知天命”，随着年龄的增长，世界观、人生观、价值观的成熟，这个时候人们作出的选择，往往是他们比较成熟的选择。因此人们往往不能接受丧失晚节的人，而可以原谅晚年悔改的人。俗话说“浪子回头金不换”，“放下屠刀立地成佛”，对于有过错的人，只要肯悔改，不论其过去如何堕落，世人往往会钦佩其有过能改的决心与志气。对于那些前半生是好人，晚年丧失节操的人，世人对他们往往更为厌恶。</p>
<p>很多人都知道汪精卫是一个汉奸，他为日本人充当傀儡，置民族大义于不顾，牺牲中华民族利益换来一个千古骂名，实在是不值得。其实青年时候的汪精卫曾经是一个爱国青年，他跟随孙中山先生革命，曾立下过许多功劳。当年他曾经置自己生死于不顾，刺杀满清摄政王。可见一个人晚节实在重要，晚节不保，则前半生清白、功劳统统付之流水。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是民国时候，有一位土匪，他做了大半辈子打家劫舍的坏事。突然有一天这位土匪为自己以往所犯下的罪孽后悔不已。年轻时候，他曾经学过一些医术，他为了弥补自己以往的罪过，便开始行医救人。他为自己设定一目标，他曾经杀过多少人，现在便要救活多少人。他不计辛苦，一面研究医术，一面治病救人，终于有一天他完成了自己的目标。这个时候，抗日战争开始了，他便投身于抗战中，保家卫国。在一次战斗中，他牺牲了生命。这位曾经的土匪，因为能改过自新，最终还是能赢得人们的尊敬，不失为一位英雄。</p>
<p>君子而诈善，无异恶小人</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>君子而诈善①，无异小人之肆恶②；君子而改节③，不若小人之自新。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①诈善：伪善，虚伪，不是真正的善行。</p>
<p>②肆恶：肆，放肆，毫无顾忌。肆恶就是肆意作恶。</p>
<p>③改节：改变节操。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>假装善良、伪装成正人君子的伪君子，与毫无顾忌、随心所欲为非作歹的小人是没有什么区别的；正人君子改变自己的高远志向与良好品行，那他还不如一个能悔过自新的小人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在现实生活中，有不少道貌岸然的伪君子。人们对于伪君子尤为厌恶，伪君子和小人比起来还不如小人。因为小人起码比伪君子真，他们不会满嘴仁义道德，坏就是坏了，不会满腹坏水，却在脸上挂出甜蜜笑容。正人君子如果不能把自己的良好品行坚持下去，半路改节，那还不如一个小人能悔过自新更值得人们尊敬。</p>
<p>和小人比起来，人们为什么更讨厌伪君子？其实伪君子和小人也没什么不同，他们都是一丘之貉，只不过两者有一个真伪之别。伪君子是披着君子外衣的小人，而披上君子外套的小人之所以更让人厌恶，就是因为他们混迹于君子行列中，使人一时真假难辨。对于真小人，人们往往更容易识别，而要识别伪君子则需要一段时间。</p>
<p>白居易的《放言》诗这样写道：“赠君一法决狐疑，不用钻龟与祝蓍。试玉要烧三日满，辨材须待七年期。周公恐惧流言日，王莽谦恭未篡时。向使当初身便死，一生真伪复谁知？”辨别一个人的人品到底怎么样，是君子还是小人，并不能一下子就得出结论。这需要一定的时间，经过时间考验，才知道人品到底怎么样。王莽在没有篡夺王位之时，世人还以为他是一个忠良的臣子。这王莽乃是两汉平帝的舅舅，为人奸诈。手中掌握大权，私心中有篡夺皇位的打算。但是一时之间，不敢轻举妄动，恐怕世人不服。于是谦虚恭敬，礼贤下士，世人赞王莽有德。后来王莽自立为君，做了皇帝，改了国号，一直做了十八年皇帝才被诛杀。可见小人混迹于君子之中，挂着君子的面具，危害更大。周公是周文王少子，是一位有德行的君子。他辅佐自己的哥哥武王伐纣。武王病后，周公写文告天，愿意以自己代替哥哥受病。他藏文于金匮中，没有他人知道此事。后来武王驾崩，太子成王幼小，周公辅佐成王。有人想谋反，但是忌惮周公，于是就散布流言，说是周公欺负幼主，图谋不轨。周公辞了相位。一天大风猛雷，击开金匮，成王见了周公所写之文，方知周公是忠臣。</p>

<p>心常看圆满，世界无缺陷</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>此心常看的圆满，天下自无缺陷之世界；此心常放的平，天下自无险侧①之人情。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①险侧：阴险诡诈。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>自己的内心常保持平和圆满，这个世界也就是一个没有缺陷的世界；自己的内心常保持平和豁达，这个世界也就是一个没有阴险诡诈的世界。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有这样几个故事，可以充分说明自己圆满，世界便是一个圆满的世界；自己内心宽容豁达，世界便是一个没有阴险狡诈的世界。第一个故事说的是有一位老太太整天忧愁，别人就问她为什么总是这样闷闷不乐。她说自己有两个儿子，第一个儿子卖雨伞、雨靴，第二个儿子卖布鞋。每当晴天，她便担心大儿子的雨伞与雨靴卖不出去。每当下雨天，她又担心二儿子的布鞋生意不好做。就这样，她几乎天天都闷闷不乐。</p>
<p>第二个故事说的是有一位母亲带着两个女儿去拜访朋友。这两个小姑娘是双胞胎姐妹，长相打扮都一样，性格却不一样。一个活泼好动，一个乖巧安静。孩子母亲与朋友谈得很开心。两个小姑娘在房间里玩了一会儿，找不也什么新游戏，活泼好动的那个小姑娘便跑到院子里去玩，玩了一会她同来找她妹妹出去玩，说院子里有许多又香又大的花，非常好看、安静乖巧的妹妹便跟着姐姐跑到院子里玩，玩了一会儿她就跑进屋，显得有些闷闷不乐。孩子母亲看到她不开心的样子就问她怎么了，为什么不和姐姐在院子里玩了。安静乖巧的这个女孩就说院子里的花长了好多刺，她被刺扎到手，她讨厌这些花。这时候那活泼好动的小姑娘也跑进屋来，母亲关心孩子，就告诫她去院子里玩要小心花刺。活泼的小姑娘毫不在意地说她已经被花刺扎了一下，不过没关系的，那些与花太漂亮了。</p>
<p>北宋才子苏东坡学士与和尚佛印关系不错，常常来往交谈。有一天苏东坡问佛印：“在禅师眼中，我究竟是怎么样一个人呢？”佛印看了看苏东坡，笑眯眯说：“像一尊佛。”苏东坡听了赞美，心中人些许得意。佛印随即问苏东坡说：“在你看我，我怎么样呢？”苏东坡微笑说：“我看你像一堆牛屎。”说完苏东坡得意不已。回家之后，东坡告诉自己的妹妹苏小妹说：“今天我赢了佛印和尚。”小妹便问他是怎么样赢了佛印的。听罢哥哥的描述，小妹不以为意摇头说：“哥哥，其实输的人是你！”东坡不解，问小妹为什么这样讲。苏小妹说：“佛家讲心即是佛，心中有佛则众生皆佛，佛印看你像佛，是因为他心中有佛。”苏东坡顿时明白过来：佛印心中有佛所以他看我像佛，我看他像牛屎，那不是说我心中有牛屎吗？东坡学士不得不承认确实是自己输了。一个人心中有什么，看到的便是什么。心中有善，看到的是生活的美好；心中有恶，看到的是生活中的阴险诡诈。</p>
<p>不变其操履，不露其锋芒</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>淡薄①之士，必为浓艳者②所疑；检饬③之人，多为放肆者所忌。君子处此，固不可少变其操履④，亦不可太露其锋芒⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①淡薄：清静不争。</p>
<p>②浓艳者：热衷荣华富贵权势名利的人。</p>
<p>③检饰：谨慎检点，自我约束。</p>
<p>④操履：操守与行动。操，操行，履，实践行动。</p>
<p>⑤锋芒：刀剑的尖端，比喻人的才华和锐气。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个淡泊宁静的人，必然会受到那些追求名利的人怀疑；一个言行谨慎自律的人，经常会被放肆的小人所猜忌。有德行的君子面对这种情况，固然不可以使自己的德行有丝毫改变，同时也不可以过于表现自己的才华和锐气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有高尚节操的人，懂得自律，在同样拥有优良品质的人看来，淡泊自律等良好品行都是能引起共鸣的。但是在那些热衷于功名利禄，行为放肆的人看来，他们往往不能理解这些优良品德。也有一些人知道优良品德可贵，但是自己却没有这种品行，于是容易嫉恨猜疑有优良品德的君子。一个人如果过于表现自己的优良品质，很容易引起没有良好品行的人嫉恨。因为君子的优秀也就越发衬托出小人的缺点，小人由自卑到恼怒，他们不会反思自己，只会迁怒于人。小人不会想到“见贤思齐”，不会想到去学习培养君子的优良品德，而只想着嫉恨厌恶君子。在这种情况下，君子当然不能改变自己良好的品行，但是同时为了避免招惹无谓的猜疑与嫉恨，适当地收敛自己的锋芒是非常必要的。</p>
<p>《智囊》上有一个故事，说的是伯宗的事情。伯宗是春秋时期晋国的大夫。有一天他回到家中，很是高兴地对自己妻子说：“大家说我有才华，很像从前的阳处父大夫。”他的妻子摇头叹息说：“把你比作阳处父，你有什么可高兴的呢。阳处父华而不实，能言善辩却没有什么智谋，所以灾祸降临到他的头上。”伯宗说：“那我就把众位大夫请到咱们家来喝酒，我和他们交谈，你来听听他们说的话吧。”妻子答应了他。过些时候伯宗请了各位大夫到家里来，边喝酒边交谈。客人走后，伯宗问自己的妻子有何意见。妻子说：“这些大夫们都不如你，可是人们是不能长久忍受别人比他们优秀的，灾祸说不定就会降临到你的头上。还是赶快把儿子托付给能保护他的人吧。”后来，伯宗果然遭到别人陷害。伯宗由于显露锋芒，为自己惹来祸患。由此可见，有德行的君子既要坚持自己的高洁的操守，同时也需要将自己的锋芒敛藏。</p>
<p>真心感天地，精诚贯金石</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人心一真，便霜可飞①、城可陨②、金石可贯③。若伪妄④之人，形骸徒具，真宰⑤已亡；对人则面目可憎，独居则形影自愧。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①霜可飞：本意是天降霜，用在这里比喻人的真诚感动上天，使不可能的事变为可能，在不可能下霜的夏天却下霜。</p>
<p>②城可陨：本意是城墙可以拆毁崩塌，用在这里比喻人的真诚可以感动上天使城墙崩塌。</p>
<p>③贯：贯穿，通过。</p>
<p>④伪妄：虚伪。</p>
<p>⑤真宰：人的真正主宰，指灵魂。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人的心保持真诚纯朴，便可以感天动地，使不可能的事都变为可能，能使夏天下霜，能使城墙倒塌，能贯穿金石。如果是一个虚伪奸诈的人，则空有躯壳，身体的真正主宰灵魂已经失去；与别人相处时令人厌恶，自己独处时形影相吊，不禁暗自惭愧。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>真心诚意可以感动上天，产生巨大力量。无论做什么事情，如果能够有诚恳真挚的态度，定能收到事半功倍的效果。张良是我国历史上一位有名的谋臣，他原是韩国人，乃韩国公子，本来姓姬。后来秦始皇一统天下，消灭了韩国。他为了报仇，曾经行刺秦始皇，但是没有取得成功，却为自己惹来了祸患，不得不隐姓埋名逃走。他改名为张良，逃到下邳隐藏起来。</p>
<p>有一天，张良到圯水桥边散步，在桥上遇见一位老人。这个老人身穿粗布衣服，走到张良身边，突然他的一只鞋子掉在桥下。老人看着张良说：“小子，你去帮我把鞋取上来。”张良听了愕然，心想我认识你吗？就这么使唤我。真想揍这老头。可是转念又一想，这么老的人，下桥去捡鞋确实比较费劲，就不和他计较了。于是张良忍住心中的不痛快，走下桥去帮老人捡回鞋来。张良把鞋递给老人，谁知这老人并不伸手来接，而是伸出脚来，说：“帮我把鞋穿上。”张良想反正已经帮他取鞋了，不如好人做到底，于是就蹲下身帮老人把鞋穿上。老人等张良为他穿好鞋之后，笑眯眯地走了。什么话都没说，也没有感谢张良。张良大为惊奇，目送老人离去，心想这老儿倒是有些古怪，不知是什么来头。老人走了很远，突然又返同来，对张良说：“你这小子还不错，值得教。五天之后的早上，我们在这里见面。”张良觉得这个老人有些不同寻常，于是便痛快答应了。五天之后，一大早，张良赶往桥边，却发现老人已经在桥上等着了。张良心中觉得很羞愧。老人生气说：“和老人家约会，你年少的人怎么可以迟到！今天就算了，五天之后再来此地见面吧。”</p>
<p>张良无奈，自知理亏，便答应五天之后再来。又过了五天，鸡一叫张良立刻就从床上起来，急急忙忙赶往桥边。心想这一次应该不会迟到吧！谁知道赶到桥边一看，老人家又已经在桥上等着了。老人又怒气冲冲说：“你怎么又迟到了？再给你一次机会，五天之后在此见面。”张良惭愧极了。五天之后，张良半夜就起床，飞快赶往桥边。到桥边一看，这一次老人家不在那里。张良松了一口气，过了一会儿老人也来了，看到张良很高兴。他取出一编书给张良说：“把这书读透了，可以辅佐帝王，建功立业。”说完老人家就走了。张良翻看手中书，乃是《太公兵法》。后来张良凭此奇书，辅佐刘邦打天下，建立了一番功业。</p>
<p>心体如天体，流转勿凝滞</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>霁①日青天，倏变为迅雷震电；疾风怒雨，倏转②为朗月晴空。气机③何尝一毫凝滞④，太虚⑤何尝一毫障蔽，人之心体亦当如是。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①霁：雨后天转晴。</p>
<p>②倏：突然，形容速度非常快。</p>
<p>③气机：气，构成世界万物的本原物质。机，使世界万物运动变化的力量。气机在这里指大自然。</p>
<p>④凝滞：停止不动。</p>
<p>⑤太虚：辽阔的天空。《文选·孙绰游天台山赋》中有“太虚辽阔而无阂”之句。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>风和日丽的好天气，会突然变成电闪雷鸣的恶劣天气；狂风暴雨的恶劣天气，会突然变成明月晴空的好天气。可见大自然从不停止运动变化，天体的运行也不会受到丝毫阻碍。人的心也要像大自然一样，一刻不停地变化发展，而不是停滞不前。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>毛泽东有首七律诗《送瘟神》这样写道：“绿水青山枉自多，华陀无奈小虫何！千村薛荔人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌。坐地日行八万里，巡天遥看一千河。牛郎欲问瘟神事，一样悲歌逐逝波。”诗中“坐地日行八万里，巡天遥看一千河”句充分表述了我们整个世界是不停运动的。即使人们躺在那里静止不动，那也只是相对而言。地球一刻不停地运动，人类也随着地球运动每天面对日夜交替、星辰变化。科学发展到今天，整个世界的变化与发展日益加快，可以说是日新月异。世界在变化，人的心当然也不能停滞不前。心体如天体，流转变化不可停止不动。</p>
<p>三国时候，吕蒙是吴国大将。他立下过许多功劳，十分能干，但是他的文化程度不高。于是有一天，孙权就劝他说：“你现在掌权处理事情，不能不多读点书啊，你要多学习学习！”吕蒙一听，就说自己很忙，军中事务相当繁杂，所以没有时间看书学习。孙权说：“我又不是要你去专门研究经学，不过是要你拣精要的书阅读，多涉猎各种书，了解前朝历史。你说你非常忙，你再忙能有我忙吗？我就常读书呢，而且从读书中大有收获。”听孙权这么一说，吕蒙找不出什么理由拒绝了，于是开始学习，读了不少书，自觉大有长进。有一天鲁肃来到寻阳，和吕蒙商议事情。在交谈之中，鲁肃不禁对吕蒙肃然起敬。过去那个大老粗吕蒙，现在已经变得能开口侃侃而谈，且讲的都很有道理。鲁肃说：“你如今的才干谋略，可不是当初那个阿蒙了。”吕蒙笑说：“士别三日当刮目相待，鲁兄你怎么还以老眼光看我阿蒙呢？”鲁肃大笑，拜见了吕蒙的母亲，从此与吕蒙结为好友。</p>
<p>看待自己或是看待他人，都不能用停滞的眼光。用静止的眼光看自己，将找不到前进的方向与动力；用静止的眼光看他人，将不能正确认识他人。这个世界是一个时时刻刻都在变化的世界，我们的心当然也小能停滞。</p>
<p>暗室培节义，履冰操经纶</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>青天白日的节义①，自暗室屋漏②中培来；旋乾转坤的经纶③，从临深履薄中操出。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①节义：节操，</p>
<p>②暗室漏屋：指隐僻别人看不到的地方。</p>
<p>③经纶：筹划治理国家大事的才能。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>光明坦荡的节操，是在别人看不到的地方培养出来的；扭转乾坤、治理国家的才能，是在时时刻刻谨慎小心的磨炼中积累起来的。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>三国时候的诸葛亮，在中国可谓家喻户晓。有许多成语典故与他有关，形容一个人聪明时可说他如诸葛亮一般神机妙算，并有“三个臭皮匠赛过诸葛亮”之说，三顾茅庐说的就是刘备请诸葛亮出山辅佐自己的事情。杜甫有《咏怀古迹》咏叹诸葛丞相：“诸葛大名垂宇宙，宗臣遗像肃清高。三分割据纡筹策，万古云霄一羽毛。伯仲之间见伊吕，指挥若定失萧曹。运移汉祚终难复，志决身歼军务劳。”另外一首《蜀相》这样写道：“丞相祠堂何处寻？锦官城外柏森森。映阶碧草自春色，隔叶黄鹂空好音。三顾频烦天下计，两朝开济老臣心。出师未捷身先死，长使英雄泪满襟！”这两首诗，可谓概括了诸葛亮一生事业精要。</p>
<p>刘备欲成就一番大事业，苦于找不到一位有大才干的人辅佐。后来听人说诸葛亮十分有才干，刘备顿时起钦慕之心，决定请诸葛亮来辅佐自己。刘备年龄比诸葛亮大许多，属于诸葛亮父辈人。但是对这个比自己小许多的诸葛先生，刘备却十分尊敬，以求贤若渴的态度去拜访诸葛孔明。第一次没有遇见孔明，第二次孔明依然不在家，刘备没有放弃，继续去拜访诸葛亮，第三次刘备终于遇见诸葛亮。刘备的一片诚恳打动了诸葛先生，从此之后，诸葛亮竭尽一生所能兢兢业业辅佐刘备，成就了一番大事业。刘备死时，将自己儿子刘禅托付给诸葛亮，并说能辅佐就辅佐他，假如刘禅不才，不值得辅佐，那么诸葛亮可以取代刘禅。刘备临终遗言更将诸葛亮紧紧抓住，使诸葛亮耗尽心血，竭尽所能辅佐刘禅。他在给刘禅的《出师表》中说：“臣本布衣，躬耕于南阳，苟全性命于乱世，不求闻达于诸侯。先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顾臣于草庐之中，咨臣以当世之事，由是感激，遂许先帝以驱驰。后值倾覆，受任于败军之际，奉命于危难之间，尔来二十有一年矣……先帝知臣谨慎，故临崩寄臣以大事也。受命以来，夙夜忧叹，恐托付不效，以伤先帝之明，故五月渡泸，深入不毛。今南方已定，兵甲已足，当奖率三军，北定中原，庶竭驽钝，攘除奸凶，兴复汉室，还于旧都。此臣所以报先帝而忠陛下之职分也。”</p>
<p>诸葛亮切实履行自己表中所说，兢兢业业，不曾有丝毫松懈。他不为自己谋富贵，虽然身为丞相，家中却没有积攒什么财富。一生谨慎，责任在身，无丝毫懈怠，正是如此精神使诸葛亮建功立业、济世安邦，成就了他知古良相美名。</p>
<p>德者才之主，才者德之奴</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>德者才之主，才者德之奴。有才无德，如家无主而奴用事①矣，几何不魍魉②猖狂③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①用事：管事，处理事情。</p>
<p>②魍魉：传说中的一种鬼怪。《孔子家语》中说“木石之怪曰魍魉”。</p>
<p>③猖狂：肆无忌惮，放肆。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人的品德是他才干的主人，他的才干是他品德的奴仆。有才干却没有德行，就好比一个家庭中没有主人而让奴仆当家管事，这样哪能不让家庭受到祸害呢。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>理想的人是德才兼备，但是现实中有一些人是有才无德，还有一些人有德无才。用人单位在挑选人才时，多要德才兼备的人才，同时又强调在德才兼备的基础上，以德为先。一个人的品德与才干都很重要，但是品德与才干的地位却不是平等的。无才无德之人，对社会的危害比有才无德之人对社会的危害小。同是无德之人，没有才干的就好比手中没什么武器，想做坏事只能赤手空拳，危害面有限。有才干却没有德行的人，就好比坏人手中握有破坏力极强的重型武器，对社会的危害实在不小。德行是才干的主人，为有德者所用，而不能反过来以才干为主人，以德性为奴仆。</p>
<p>三国时候，吕布是一个较有才干的人，他武功不错，也有一定计谋，机遇也不错。但是最终吕布并没有建立什么实在功业，究其原因，他有才干却少德行，为人毫无信誉，亦无忠诚可言。他不断背叛，不断自己否定自己。他先追随丁原，被董卓等诱惑，杀死丁原投靠董卓；后又杀死董卓，投靠袁术；与袁术不和，后再转投袁绍；与袁绍不和，转而攻打曹操；打不过曹操，跑去投靠刘备。刘备让他屯兵小沛，他却趁刘备与他人交战之际，夺下徐州，占了刘备的地盘。刘备没有地方可去，只好反过来投靠吕布，吕布便让刘备屯兵小沛。吕布就是这样一个反复无常的人，有才干却欠缺德行的人，因而根本不可靠，也就无法成就一番事业。</p>
<p>宋太宗选用人才时，德行与学识相比，他更看重士人之德行。如果是一个有才华，但是德行欠缺的人，他是不会选用的。当时南唐投降过来的臣子张洎很有才干，是一个饱学之士。论才学，当时北宋朝廷中很少有人比得上他。于是有人向宋太宗推荐他，但是宋太宗对他并不重用，不让他担任重要职位。宋太宗说：“张洎确实很有才华，但是士大夫应当以德性为第一位，如果只重视才学，却少德行，那么这个人是不可取的。”</p>

<p>德者事业基，心者修行根</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>德者事业之基①，未有基不固而栋宇坚久者：心者修行②之根，未有根不植而枝叶荣茂者。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①基：基础，根基。《诗经·小雅》：“乐只君子，邦家之基”。</p>
<p>②修行：修养身心，实践行动。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>道德是事业的基础，就像盖房子一样，就如房子的基础没有打好房子不会坚固一样，假如没有良好的品德事业也不会长久。心性是修行根基，就像没有根的植物不能长得茂盛一样，心性不正就不可能修行得道。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>品质如何，对于一个人的事业发展且有非常重要的影响。一个品德败坏的人，即使能取得一时的成功，时间一长，当大家认识了他的真实面目，他的事业也就无法再继续发展下去。火柴大王刘鸿生说过，做生意不能欺骗别人，只要你欺骗一次，顾客就会记住你，下次就不会再来。要保住生意，就得做到“童叟无欺”。他还说你如果想发大财，那么一定要让跟着你的人也能受益。有饭大家吃，不能一个人独吞。你发了大财，跟着你的人也能发小财。如果只想着一个人发财，见利忠义，看到有利益就想一个人把所有好处都占了，这是非常愚蠢的行为。一个品行不正人，无论从事哪行哪业，都只能有一时的荣耀，不可能有长久的发展，品行不端的人从政，可能会祸国殃国；经商可能会变成奸商，败坏市场秩序。爬得越高越远，摔下来也摔得更惨更重。所以事业的成功，离不开良好的道德品质。</p>
<p>古人说，成就一番大事业，有亲戚朋友帮忙，不如有一批德才兼备的人才跟随。周文王选拔任用德才兼备的姜尚辅佐自己成就了大事业。刘邦成就事业，当上了皇帝，他的成功在于他非常善于用人。他的手下张良、萧何以及韩信、陈平等人，都是非常能干之人。其中虽然有矜持骄傲之人，但是刘邦手下大部分人都不失为德才兼备之人。历史传说中，尧有十个儿子，但是他没有把自己的位置留给任何一个儿子，而是传给了德才兼备的舜。因为舜德才兼备，能够把国家的事情处理好。舜也有许多儿了，他也没有把王位传给自己的儿子，而是把王位留给了大禹。禹德才兼备，治理水患为国家作出了贡献，能够把国家治理得更好，所以舜把王位传给了大禹。</p>
<p>德才兼备的人，才能成就一番事业。某公司的高层谈及自己的用人之道时说：有德无才的人，培养任用他；有才无德的人，限制用他；德才兼备的人，培养重用他。可见发展事业，需要培养良好品德；修行悟道，需要保持心性纯良。</p>
<p>勤者敏德义，世人济其贫</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>勤者敏①于德义，而世人借勤以济其贫；俭者淡于货利，而世人假②俭以饰③其吝。君子持身之符④，反为小人营私之具矣，惜哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①敏：勤敏，勤奋的意思。</p>
<p>②假：假借。</p>
<p>③饰：掩饰。</p>
<p>④符：法则、原则。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>勤奋的人应当在品德修养上多下工夫，可是有些人却把勤奋用在解决自己的贫困上；勤俭节约的人不看重财物利益，可是有些人却以勤俭节约为名来掩饰自己的吝啬。君子处世的原则标准却成了小人谋私利的工具，真可惜啊！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有德行的人处世坚持的原则，却变成某些小人谋取私利的工具，世界上这样的事情很多。无论是中国还是外国，无论是古代还是当今社会，都不缺少这样的事例。曹操表面上尊迎汉献帝，实质上是为自己打算，“挟天子以令诸侯”。武则天废太子理由冠冕堂皇，实则是自己想取而代之当皇帝。有些国家打着和平人道的旗号，干涉进攻别国，实则是想获取别国资源。</p>
<p>勤奋是美德，如果只把勤奋用在为自己谋私利上，这种美德也就打折扣了。勤奋努力不仅是为了自己，也为了社会，这种勤奋就更为可贵。诺贝尔奖获得者居里夫人就是一位勤奋好学的人。早年她与姐姐到巴黎求学，可是家境贫寒，她先赚钱供姐姐学习。姐姐毕业当了医生之后，她才进巴黎大学学习。她很珍惜学习机会，勤奋刻苦，用两年的时间获得了物理和数学两个硕士学位，在此期间她认识了皮埃尔·居里，两人结为夫妇，共同致力于科学研究工作。他们在研究中发现一种新的放射性元素，将这种新元素命名为钋。接下来他们义发现一种放射性更强的镭，为了证明镭的存在，他们下决心把镭提炼出来。由于资金有限，他们买不起含有镭的铀矿石，就利用价格低廉的铀沥青残渣提炼。在一间条件恶劣的实验室里，他们顶着严寒与酷暑，用最简单的工具，不停工作，经过几年的辛勤劳动，他们终于从几十吨铀沥青残渣中提炼出氯化镭，证明了镭的存在。这一发现，使得他们获得了诺贝尔奖。放射性元素的发现，在科学历史上具有开创新纪元的重要意义，物理学由此从宏观世界迈入了新的微观世界，推动了科学发展。获得诺贝尔奖，使得居里夫妇获得一笔巨额奖金。他们没有用这笔钱来改善自己的生活条件，而是用于科学实验与帮助贫困的学生。他们发现镭之后，当时世界各地有许多人来索求提炼镭的方法。申请专利获得巨额财富，还是毫无保留公布镭的提炼方法，居里夫妇选择了后者，他们说：“镭不应该使任何人发财，应该属于大家，物理学家总是把研究成果全部发表的。”</p>
<p>为鼠常留饭，怜蛾纱罩灯</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>为鼠常留饭，怜蛾纱罩灯。古人此点念头，是吾人一点生生之机①，无此即所谓土木形骸②而已。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①生生之机：生生，繁衍不息的意思。机，事物发生的枢纽。</p>
<p>②土木形骸：像泥土与木头一样的身体，比喻只有躯壳，没有灵魂。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>因为怕老鼠饿死，所以经常留一点剩饭给老鼠吃；因为怕灯火烧死喜欢扑火的飞蛾，所以夜晚用纱把灯给罩起来。古人的这种慈悲之心、仁慈之念，是人类繁衍不息的生机。没有这点仁慈之心，人也就只剩下没有灵魂的躯壳，与泥雕木偶相差不多了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>杜甫有一首诗写道：“堂前扑枣任西邻，无食无儿一妇人。不为穷困宁有此？只缘恐惧转须亲。即防远客虽多事，便插疏篱却甚真。已诉征求贫到骨，正思戎马泪盈巾。”这首诗歌是杜甫写给自己亲戚吴郎的，杜甫在夔州瀼西草堂居住时，西屋邻居是一位生活穷苦的老寡妇。杜甫院中有一棵枣树，每到结枣子的时候，老寡妇常到屋前来打枣子。杜甫对她穷困的境况非常同情，任由她打枣，不加以阻拦。当杜甫从瀼西搬走时，把草堂让给了他的亲戚吴郎居住。吴郎用篱笆把房前的枣树围了起来，阻止他人前来打枣。杜甫知道之后，便写了这首诗寄给吴郎，希望他不要阻止西屋邻居老妇人打枣。</p>
<p>杜甫的诗歌之所以享有盛名，其中很重要一个原因就是他的诗中往往体现出一种悲天悯人的慈悲情怀，这种慈悲之情历久弥传，穿越千年依然能深深打动读者。斗转星移，时空变幻，中华民族的善良品质却代代相传。时值今日，这种善良的品质依然是鼓舞激励中华民族前进的精神动力。有一位叫丛飞的歌手，他并不是多么著名的歌手，但他是一位令人感动的歌手。因为他曾经在十多年间的时间里一直坚持做慈善事，捐款捐物，资助了183名贫困儿童。他自己却身患胃癌，物质生活并不优越。有一位靠收废品为生的老人，他无儿无女，老伴早已经过世。收废品赚一点小钱，有时候他也捡点废品卖钱。他对生活的要求不高，有地方住，有饭吃就满足了。他没有别的爱好，吃东西也只挑便宜的。对生活要求很低，他赚的那点小钱足够他开销，有时候还会剩下一点钱。他把这点钱攒起来，又捐出去，资助那些考上大学却读不起的孩子。他捐钱是匿名的，受捐助的孩子们都不知道资助他们上学的人是谁。老人一直默默捐款，自己过着非常俭省的生活，直到他去世之后，他资助孩子们上学的事情才被人们发现。像这样的事例有很多，中华民族从来都不缺少善良与同情心。</p>
<p>定云止水中，有鱼跃鸢飞</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>好动者云电风灯①，嗜寂者②死灰槁木③。须定云止水④中，有鱼跃鸢⑤飞气象，才是有道的心体⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①云电风灯：云、电、风、灯都是不稳定、短暂容易变化的事物。</p>
<p>②嗜寂者：嗜好寂静的人。</p>
<p>③死灰槁木：死灰，是指火彻底熄灭后剩下的灰烬。槁木，指枯树。死灰槁木用在这里比喻丧失生机。在《庄子·齐物论》中有：“形固可使如槁木，而心固可使如死灰乎。”</p>
<p>④定云止水：定云，停止不动的云。止水，不流动的水。</p>
<p>⑤鸢：形状如鹰。</p>
<p>⑥心体：本体，古时有以心为思想主体的理论。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>好动的人就好比云彩、闪电、大风、灯火，飘忽不定、变化多端而又短暂容易消逝。过分喜欢清静的人，好比没有生机的死灰与枯木。过于好动与过于喜欢清静，都不是理想的人生态度。能在停在天空缓缓移动的云彩与寂静的水面中，看到飞翔的鸢与跳跃的鱼，这才是理想的人生境界。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>静与动本是一对矛盾，世界万事万物都在运动变化，在绝对的运动变化中又存在着相对静止。绝对的运动与相对的静止，过于强调哪一个方面都不恰当。过分爱好动，那就成了飘忽不定，短暂容易消逝，形不成稳定可靠的品质。宁静致远，过分爱好寂静，那也就像死灰与枯木一样，没有一点生机可言，这也不可取。不管动还是静，都不可太极端。做任何事情，如果走向极端，那就会促使事情向相反方向转化，达不到自己想要的结果，与人们最初的目标越来越远。动与静相对应，任何人都具有静与动两个方面。最爱好寂静的人，也有好动的时候。</p>
<p>有一个男生特别喜欢安静，喜欢独处，看到吵闹的场面，听到人们大声喧哗，他心中就特别厌恶。宿舍中其他同学知道他喜欢安静，也就不和他闲聊。在一个周末，家在本地的舍友都回家了，宿舍只剩下这个好静的男生小林和另一个家也在外地的男生小沙、小沙知道小林不喜欢和人交谈，便也不打扰小林，上床准备睡觉。这时候小林突然和小沙说起话来，闲谈了很多事情。小沙惊诧得眼珠差点从眼眶中蹦出来，他从来没想到小林居然也会找人说话，还这么能说。没有人是完全静止的，就是那些嗜好寂静的人，也有交流的欲望。好动的人也不会是时时刻刻都好动，他们也有安静的时候。</p>
<p>春景山水图</p>
<p>动静结合，动中有静，静中有动，动静合宜才是人生的理想状态。在一个裹足不前的社会里，拿出勇气，积极奔走，创造一个新社会。在一个积极发展的社会里，随着社会大潮奋勇前进之时，找出时间多思考，在动中取静。因为一个人如果总是不停变动，不确定一个人生目标，那么对个人发展是非常不利的。对于一个国家而言，总是动荡政局不稳，也不会得到长久发展。老子说：“治大国，若烹小鲜。”一个国家的稳定非常重要，改革变动不宜过于频繁。从个人到国家，都需要动静结合，不偏动也不偏静。对于个人修养来说，古语云“静若处子，动若脱兔”，可谓是理想的人生修养境界。</p>
<p>居卑知高危，处晦知明露</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>居卑①而后知登高之为危，处晦②而后知向明之太露；守静而后知好动之过劳，养默③而后知多言之为躁④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①居卑：处在位置低的地方。</p>
<p>②处晦：处在昏暗的地方。</p>
<p>③养默：不多说话，沉默寡言。</p>
<p>④躁：不冷静，性急。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>处在位置低的地方向高处看，才知道攀登到高的地方非常危险。待在昏暗的地方，才知道处在光亮的地方太刺眼。保持清静无为，才知道爱好活动非常劳累。不多说话才知道多说话是急躁的表现。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>处于事物的对立面，对事物的了解才能更加深入与透彻。登高望远何等惬意，但是在低处向高处看，才知道走到高处不仅能令人感到愉悦，登高的过程是非常危险的，待在高处也是有危险的。待在昏暗的地方可以对光明的地方多一层了解，清静之中可以回想好动的辛劳，沉默之中才醒悟自己过往话太多是急躁的表现。推而广之，处在贫困之中，能省悟安逸生活中也隐藏危险；处在悲伤之中，能体会从前的幸福原来不是天长地久，原来幸福中已埋伏不幸福的因子。</p>
<p>从事物对立面来了解事物，能对事物有清醒认识，能够更清醒冷静地安排生活。安逸之中，不沉溺于安逸；显贵得意之中，不得意忘形。有一个非常有名的青蛙实验。研究人员准备了一锅开水，他们找来一只大青蛙，把这只青蛙用力扔到沸腾的开水锅中。这只青蛙居然用尽全身力气，猛然一跳，一下子跳出开水锅，死里逃生！等了一会儿，研究人员用刚才盛沸水的锅装了一锅冷水，然后把刚才那只成功逃命的青蛙放到冷水锅中。青蛙在冷水中自得其乐游来游去。研究人员在锅底加热，锅中冷水渐渐变热。青蛙依然在锅中游来游去，但是渐渐锅中水的温度越来越高，青蛙终于忍不住想跳出铁锅，但是却全身无力，被煮死在锅中。生于忧患死于安乐，危险骤然来临，人们能想法抵抗。但是对于生活中那些隐藏的危险，人们往往会放松警惕，但实际上危险一直存在。因为世界上万事万物都有其对立物，有高处就有低处，有光明就有黑暗，有动就有静。苦难与幸福相对，有幸福就有苦难的存在，享受幸福就不能不记得苦难的存在。</p>
<p>生活中人们往往容易只看到事物的一个方面，而忘记它还有另一面的存在。安徒生童话中有这样一个故事，有一双鞋，穿上它能够穿越到自己想去的任何地方。结果穿上这双鞋的每一个人都发现，原来他们想去的地方都不如他们想象得那么美好。从前这些人只看到他们梦想中所在的美妙之处，却忘记这些地方还有另一面不那么美妙。全面清醒认识事物，可以使我们更冷静地面对生活。</p>
<p>吉人多和气，凶人多杀机</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>吉人①无论作用安详②，即梦寐神魂③，无非和气；凶人无论行事狠戾，即声音笑貌，浑是杀机④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①吉人：善良的人。</p>
<p>②作用安详：言行举止大方从容。</p>
<p>③梦寐神魂：睡梦中的神情样子。</p>
<p>④杀机：杀人的念头。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>善良的人，言行举止都是和气镇定的样子，即使在睡梦中也洋溢着吉祥和气；凶恶的人，无论做什么事情都凶狠毒辣，甚至声音与笑脸，都洋溢着杀气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>善良的人，恭敬宽厚，气质仪表也会是一派端庄和气。佛家讲“相由心生”是有道理的，一个人内心怎么样，总会在气质言行举止之中有所表现。一个凶恶的人，无论他怎么样会掩饰自己，凶恶之气还是会在不经意中流露出来。</p>
<p>中国古代官吏断案故事中，有许多观察疑犯气质举止，最后发现案情真相的故事。唐朝时，某地方官审理一个盗窃案。疑犯是一伙江洋大盗，做盗贼已经多年。他们盗窃的是当地有名大富之家。案情已经很明朗，赃物与盗贼都已经抓到，但是审理此案的官人还有一处有些不解。按照律法，盗贼的头领所犯的罪是最严重的，所受到的惩罚也是最严厉的。这伙盗贼的首领是一个沉默寡言的人。看着这个贼头，断案官觉得有些不对劲。他观察这个贼头，觉得此贼头气质相貌都没有凶恶的感觉，倒像是一个读书人。于是断案官和颜悦色问贼头，他原来是做什么的，什么时候开始做贼头。贼头看见审案子的官态度很温和，胆子一大便把事情原原本本都说出来了。原来他本来确实是一个读书人，只因为家中贫困，缺衣少食，才被盗贼们怂恿做了贼。贼人们许诺，这次得手多分些金银给他。这读书人想着就做这一次，分到些金银，以后就再也不干这事。结果第一次偷窃，就被抓了进来。而且实际上动手偷盗的人也不是他，他不过是被推举为首领，偷盗当时他仅在外面望风而已。了解了这些情况，审案子的官便判了这读书人轻罪，没有按贼首的重罪处罚他。</p>
<p>宋朝时，有几个读书人赴京赶考。他们带了些行李，并没有多少钱。有天他们没赶上投宿客店，太阳落山时，他们正走在前不着村后不着店的地方。他们着急之中，快走几步，看到一所庙宇。几个人便商量要不要去庙里投宿，其中有一位姓黄的读书人为人比较精细，他建议还是水要轻易去庙里住，谁知道庙里住的是不是好和尚。正商量的时候，庙门被打开，走出来一老一小两个和尚。和尚们请这些人到庙里住，并且说地方尽够这些人住的。大家想人多势众，也不怕这两个和尚，便决定在庙里投宿。老和尚与小和尚对他们很殷勤，端来素菜饭请他们吃，并且还有几大壶酒。众人一尝，酒味醇美，于是都放开肚皮尽情喝。黄秀才精细，他注意看那老和尚，总觉得心里不安。这老和尚虽然对人很和气，可是身上隐隐有点杀气。于是黄秀才劝大家少喝点酒，可是没人听他劝，大家喝得很高兴。晚上睡觉时，黄秀才不敢闭眼。他偷偷起来，到外面方便，却发现老和尚带着许多人手握刀子，杀气腾腾向黄秀才他们住的地方走去。黄秀才大惊，来不及提醒众人逃命，他自己赶紧向外面跑。经过一夜逃跑，黄秀才终于逃到安全地方。后来此案告破，黄秀才发现自己当初果然没有看错，那老和尚曾经是江洋大盗，当和尚后依然是杀人如麻的恶人。</p>
<p>与人相观治，一方便法门</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人之际遇①，有齐有不齐②，而能使己独齐乎？己之情理③，有顺有不顺，而能使人皆顺乎？以此相观对治④，亦是一方便法门⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①际遇：遭遇，机会。</p>
<p>②齐：相等，齐平。</p>
<p>③情理：情绪与思虑，人的精神状态。</p>
<p>④相观对治：相互参照修正。</p>
<p>⑤方便法门：佛家语，方便是以灵活方式教人，使其领悟佛法真义。法门，指领悟佛法的通道。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>每个人的遭遇各有不同，有的人遇到好机会，有的人没有遇到好机会，人怎么能要求自己一定要遇到好机会呢？人的情绪有时好有时坏，人怎么能要求自己事事顺心呢？对照着别人的境遇来思考自己的问题，这也是领悟人生道理、提高自身修养的一个好方法。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>每个人的遭遇都不同，这个世界是一个有差异的世界。正因为有差异，这个世界才显得如此多姿多彩。有的人事业成功，有的人一事无成。有的人生来聪明，有的人天生比较拙笨。有的人灵巧秀美，有的人笨拙粗糙。有人说老天是公平的，也有人说老天根本就是偏心的。无论人们怎么样认识世界，都不得不先承认这个世界确实是有差异的。这个世界不是整齐划一的，也不是完全平均与绝对平等的。无论人们如何认识，这个事实不会因为人们的认识改变。抱怨老天不公平，或者是感叹老天对每个人都是公平的，都不会使老天从此就变得更公平或者是更加不公平。因此关键在于人们怎么认识对待它，当生活不如意时抱怨无济于事。抱怨自己运气差，这个世界总能找出运气更差的人。抱怨命运不公平，这个世界也能找出遭受命运更加不公平待遇的人。懈怠时想想比自己勤奋的人，可以使自己更加努力。抱怨生活条件苦的时候，可以想想那些生活更加困苦的人。这样对照比较，自己的不平之心，郁闷的情绪，都能得到纾缓。</p>
<p>假如为自己格外平凡，既不是天资聪慧，也没有天赋特长苦恼，那就想想张海迪、海伦·凯勒、保尔·柯察金。这样一对比，我们会觉得自己身体健康、四肢健全十分珍贵。他们是一直与病魔抗争的人，身体的痛苦折磨并没有消磨掉他们的志气。在与病痛斗争中，他们创造了自己的生命价值。假如为自己没有遇到好的机会而苦闷，那么想想沃特·迪斯尼。一个年青人，在大城市里经历很多次挫折之后，终于找到一份工作。但是他身上已经只剩下一点钱。生活格外俭省又艰苦。他住在旧车库里，这地方有不少老鼠。他经常能听到老鼠吱吱叫，时间一久，这老鼠竟然跑跑出来，明目张胆地在屋子里游走。有时这老鼠竟然跑到青年人的画板上，为青年人孤独的生活增添了一点趣味。后来，这位年轻画家到好莱坞去制作卡通片。最初，他找不到感觉，工作进度缓慢，他很苦恼。在一天晚上，他在冥思苦想中突然想到那些老鼠。于是他在画板上画起老鼠来，这些老鼠就是后来在全球享有很高知名度的米老鼠。这个年青人就是迪斯尼乐园的创始人。</p>
<p>吾身小天地，天地大父母</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>吾身一小天地也，使喜怒不愆①，好恶有则，便是燮理②的功夫；天地一大父母也，使民无怨咨③，物无氛疹④，亦是敦睦的气象。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①愆：罪过，过失。</p>
<p>②燮理：调理，协和治理。</p>
<p>③怨咨：怨恨嗟叹。</p>
<p>④氛疹：凶恶之气与各种恶病。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>我们的身体就是一个小世界，能够使自己无论高兴与愤怒都坚持不犯错误，喜欢与憎恶都有一定的准则，这就是协和调理的功夫；天地是人类的父母，能够使人们没有牢骚抱怨，使万物不受各种灾害迫害而顺利生长，这也是天地造物的恩德，天地间一片和谐的景象。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人是自然的一部分，人与天地自然之间具有相通之处。古人有天人感应论，讲人与天地自然之间交相感应。人与自然确实有相类似之处，由大自然的变化可以反省人类自身，人与自然相通。人有喜怒哀乐的情绪变化，自然有春夏秋冬的四季变化。喜怒哀乐都不过分，控制在一定程度内，那么对人就不会造成损害。如果喜怒哀乐没有节制，则必然会使人身心受到伤害。大自然阴晴变化，风云雨雪天气交替，如果不超出一个度，那么能使自然万物顺利生长。如果雨雪阴晴变化没有规律，暴风暴雨暴雪或者干旱无风云雨雪，这样的环境都不利于万物生长。人与自然都遵守一定规则与规律，才能呈现稳定和谐的气象。</p>
<p>人的喜怒哀乐各种情绪，缺一不可，同样哪种情绪过于泛滥也都不可以。过喜过怒过悲，对人的身心都会造成损害。控制自己的情绪，避免大喜大悲，生气发火只针对值得的事情，而且不宜过度，这是有修养的人具有的品质。荀子说：水与火有气，但是它们没有生命；草木等有生命但是没有知觉，飞禽走兽虽然有知觉但是不懂得礼义廉耻；人有生命，有知觉，又懂得礼义廉耻，因此人是天下最高贵的。人的力气不如牛，奔跑又比不上马，但是牛马却被人们驱使劳作，原因就在于人能合群，牛马不能合群。人之所以能够合群，又因为人有等级名分之分，等级名分的贯彻实行又有赖于礼义来协调。由此，以礼义定等级名分，使人各得其所，各归其位，这样就能发挥集体的力量。团结一致，集体力量强大，强大就能战胜万物。知礼义廉耻，言行举止与为人处世，都合乎一定规范。人比其他生物高明的地方也正在于此，人知道礼义廉耻，能以此约束自己。喜怒哀乐，憎恶或是喜欢别人，都不从自己个人偏好出发，而是根据礼义规范，以礼仪规范来要求约束自己。</p>
<p>去混心自清，去苦乐自存</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>水不波①则自定，鉴②不翳③则自明。故心无可清，去其混之者而清自现；乐不必寻，去其苦之者而乐自存。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①波：波动。</p>
<p>②鉴：镜子。</p>
<p>③翳：遮蔽，遮挡。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>水面没有被风吹起波浪自然平静，镜子没有被灰尘遮盖自然明亮。所以人的心灵没有必要去刻意清洗，驱除心中杂念与邪念，心灵自然平静清明；没有必要去刻意寻找快乐，驱除心中烦躁，那么自然会感觉到幸福快乐。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>中国古代有些思想家认为人的本性光明善良，所以只要排除人心中的杂念、欲念、邪念，人的心就会恢复本来的光明。人的善良本性不被杂念遮盖，人们的生活自然能过得快乐自在。人类的苦恼都是自己招惹的，所谓“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”，除掉心中杂念干扰，能保持内心纯净，生活中苦恼会减少许多。人是社会动物，人的生存与发展都离不开社会，所以人不可避免地要受到社会的影响。现实世界如何，对人的影响作用非常大。一个良好的社会环境，有利于造就优秀人才。社会环境不好，不利于培养人才。社会对人的影响作用非常大，这一点每个人都不可否认。然而社会造就影响个人，不等于说个人在社会面前毫无作为，每个人自己的努力程度对于个人的发展起着至关重要的作用。人生活在社会之中，虽然不能不受社会影响，但是人可以努力使自己少受社会不良影响，多受社会有益影响。时时排除心中各种杂念，扫去社会在自己心中留下来的灰尘。</p>
<p>孔子的弟子曾参，年纪虽小，勤奋好学。别人问他为什么进步很快。曾参说：“吾日三省吾身，为人谋而不忠乎？与朋友交而不信乎？传不习乎？”也就是说他每天多次反省自身，看自己替别人谋划考虑问题是不是全心全意，和朋友交往是不是诚心实意。老师传授的知识是不是反复练习实践。一旦发现自己哪方面做得不好，立刻改正。养成每天自我反省的好习惯，长时间坚持下来，自然能获得很大进步。</p>
<p>孔子</p>
<p>著名戏剧家萧伯纳享有盛名，他经常收到一些邀请。有一次他在莫斯科遇见一个很可爱的小孩子，萧伯纳便与这个小孩子一起玩。分别时，萧伯纳说自己是世界上非常有名的萧伯纳，小孩子也很骄傲地报上自己的名字。小孩子骄傲的样子使得萧伯纳突然有所触动，他发现自己潜意识中还是存在傲慢的念头。从那以后，他时时警戒自己保持谦虚态度。人们养成时时反省自身的好习惯，有利于培养良好德行。时常反思，驱除心中杂念，保持心地干净，则生活中也就没有那么多苦恼与烦躁。</p>
<p>心虚则性现，意净则心清</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心虚①则性现，不息心而求见性②，如拨③波觅月；意净则心清，不了意而求明心，如索镜增尘。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①心虚：指心无杂念，心地干净。</p>
<p>②性：本性。</p>
<p>③拨：拨动。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>心中没有杂念，人的本性就会显现出来，不使自己内心保持平静却想发现人的本性，那就如拨动水波去捞取月亮一般，只落得一场空；意念保持澄净清明，心灵才能澄净清明，假如不能了解存在的意念而想使内心澄净清明，那就像在落满了灰尘的镜子上又增添了一层灰尘。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>要了解自己的本性，只有在内心没有杂念的时候，心平气和的情况下，人的本性才会出现，保持心虚与意净才能发现自己的本性，看到自己的本来面目。如果是非、爱憎与善恶因果各种杂念缠绕在心中，要想发现自己的本性那就不可能了，如水中捞取月亮一般，最终手中剩下的是一场空而已。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是有两位僧人，他们在一起修行。在荒山废庙之中，这两个僧人多年在此修行悟道，几十年都没有下山。食物简陋，有时候还没有食物，他们也毫不介意，就饥一顿饱一顿，心无杂念，坚持修行。有一天晚上，左边的僧人在寂静的夜晚，突然听到有哭声与恶斗的声音传来。这位僧人本来想置之不理，奈何这声音非常响亮，他被搅扰得无法静心修行。就在心中烦乱不已的时候，突然发现一个怪物跑到自己面前。这怪物非常庞大，面目怪异，张牙舞爪，张开血盆大口，露出白森森的牙齿来咬左边僧人。左边僧人大惊失色，站起来跌跌撞撞向山下飞奔。怪物在僧人身后一路追赶，左边僧人掉进一口枯井中，结果在枯井中发现一具尸体，由此惹上一场官司。左边僧人被抓起来询问，吃了许多苦，挨打受饿，差点被冤枉成杀人凶手。虽然最终查明僧人不是杀人凶手，但是左边僧人已经吃了非常多的苦。后来左边僧人回到修行的地方，右边僧人说那天晚上他没有看到什么怪物，只是看到左边僧人突然发狂，飞奔下山。右边僧人虽然不解，为什么左边僧人要这样做，但是也并没有放在心上。后来左边僧人在静坐之中，看到自己的前世故事，原来自己与井中被杀死的女子有前世孽缘。前生自己亏欠了这个女子，所以今生听到她的哭声，便堕入魔障，无法静心修行，由此惹来祸事。这种前生今生的说法，虽然是佛教因果轮回转世的说法，但是这个故事说明了修行悟道需要虚心无杂念、意净心清，这样才能修成正果。修行悟道需要心虚意净，修身养性同样需要如此，驱除心中私心杂念，才能培养崇高品德。</p>
<p>节义济和衷，功名承谦德</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>节义①之人，济②以和衷③，才不启忿争④之路；功名之士承以谦德，方不开嫉妒之门。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①节义：节操义气。</p>
<p>②济：增加，增补。</p>
<p>③和衷：和睦同心。</p>
<p>④忿争：愤怒争执。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个有节操的人，看问题容易偏激，增加一些温和的想法与态度调剂，这样才不会和别人无谓地愤怒争斗；取得功名、事业有所成就的人，要保持谦虚的美德，这样才不会引起别人的嫉妒。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个有节操的人，因为自己有优秀的德行，经常比平常人更加不能容忍他人的不良品行。清正廉洁的君子，往往看不起小人，不屑于和小人来往。现实生活中人数众多的不是君子与小人，而是普普通通既不是君子也不是小人的平常人。平常人往往会有这样或那样的缺点，如果人们都不能以宽容的态度对待他人，那么这个世界人与人之间矛盾争执将会无休无止。品格高洁的人，对待他人多些宽容与理解，生活便会多些和谐与温暖。唐朝时，女皇帝武则天对大臣狄仁杰很是器重。狄仁杰为人心胸宽广，待人宽厚。有一天，武则天问狄仁杰想不想知道从前有哪些人说过他的坏话。狄仁杰很坦然地说：“臣不想知道。如果臣有过错，臣会改正，至于说有人向朝廷告状，讲臣的是非，臣不想知道他是谁。”宋朝时的宰相吕蒙正待人也宽容，他第一次进入政事堂时，有一个人指着他对别人说：“这人也能参政事吗？”吕蒙正听到这话，装作没有听到，走了过去。和他同行的人为他不平，打算向别人询问刚才说话人的姓名。吕蒙正阻止他这么做，并且说：“一知道姓名，终身耿耿于怀，不如不知道的为妙。”</p>
<p>一个功成名就的人，本来就很吸引他人的注意。如果不能够持谦虚谨慎的态度，不注意保持良好的德行，那么很容易招来别人的嫉妒与仇恨。清朝雍正年间，年羹尧功高盖世，一时之间很受雍正皇帝的器重。他受到雍正的极大恩宠，高官厚禄自不必说，雍正还时时赏赐他美味珍馐、珍奇宝物。年羹尧的家人也受到雍正的关心，年羹尧身体有病时，雍正都关心问候，还赐给他药品，命御医为他治病。受到雍正的器重，年羹尧没有想到要谦虚礼让，收敛自己的言行举止，相反他嚣张跋扈、气焰熏天。他对于同僚，不能做到谦虚恭敬，反而气势凌人，有时颇为失礼。在雍正皇帝面前，有时也颇为失礼，惹得雍正心里非常不痛快。种种原因加到一起，最终使得年羹尧落得被赐自杀的结局。由此可见功劳越大，越需要谦虚谨慎。</p>
<p>有意者反远，无心者自近</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>禅宗①曰：“饥来吃饭倦来眠②。”诗旨曰：“眼前景致口头语。”盖极高寓于极平，至难出于至易；有意者反远，无心者自近也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①禅宗：佛教的一个宗派。</p>
<p>②饥来吃饭倦来眠：王阳明有诗曰：“饥来吃饭倦来眠，只此修去玄更玄，说与世人浑不信，却由身外觅神仙。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>禅宗有一句话说：“感觉到饿了就吃饭，感觉到困了就睡觉。”作诗的要领是：“写眼前的景致，运用通俗易懂的口头语。”因为世界上高深的道理，存在于平凡的事物中。最难懂的理论，存在于最简单易懂的道理中；刻意去寻觅真理，反而离真理更远了，没有刻意寻觅真理，顺其自然反而得到真理。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>世界上没有最高深的道理，如果刻意去寻找高深的道理，那注定是无法找到的。因为世界上最高深、最难懂的道理，其实是存在于最平凡的道理中。一切顺其自然，不必去刻意寻找。饿了吃饭，困了就睡觉，这样也是一种悟道。就是写诗这样的雅事，也不能脱离生活。诗歌的审美价值有助于人培养积极的人生与健康的人格。孔子说阅读研究诗歌，能够增添人的生活情趣，能够使人们抒发自己感情，能够使人们了解认识各地民土风情，可见诗歌是与人们的生活紧密相关的。中国历史上那些能感动人的诗歌，往往有其深厚的生活基础。唐朝大诗人杜甫，他的诗歌深刻描绘了当时人们生活的艰难困苦，引发阅读者的共鸣。唐朝另一位大诗人李白，他被称为“诗仙”，他的诗歌带有浓厚的浪漫主义色彩，同样受到后代人的喜爱。读李白的诗歌，能排遣心中积郁，唤起人生豪情壮志。写诗的要领在于，内容要写眼前景致，取材于生活，语言要优美通俗易懂。一首好诗语言要优美，同时要清晰流畅，便于人们理解。使用晦涩难懂的语言写出来的诗，这样的诗不能算是好诗。唐朝诗人白居易的诗，通俗易懂，琅琅上口。他认为如果一首诗写得大家都看不懂，那么这首诗写得再好也是没有用的。他每写完一首诗，就把这诗读给别人听，有时候还找不认识字的老太太来听。如果别人听得懂，他就很高兴，如果别人听不懂，他就修改这首诗，一直修改到大家能明白诗中意思为止。</p>
<p>真理不必刻意去寻找，真理就蕴藏在平凡事物中。一切顺其自然就好，有时候过于执着于某事，反而失去本来拥有的平和与才华。有一个长胡子的人，某天有人问他睡觉时，是把胡子放在被子外面还是被子里面呢，长胡子回答不上来，因为长胡子以前从来没想过这个问题。当天晚上他上床睡觉，一直想着这个问题。把胡子放在被子里面，他觉得不合适，把胡子放在被子外面，他也觉得不合适。结果他一晚上都没睡好觉。后来他想通了，胡子在里面还是外面都是无关紧要的，顺其自然就好。</p>
<p>念随起随灭，与太虚同体</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心体①便是天体②，一念之喜，景星庆云③；一念之怒，震雷暴雨；一念之慈，和风甘露；一念之严，烈日秋霜。何者所感，只要随起随灭；廓然④无碍，便与太虚⑤同体。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①心体：精神与肉体，这里指思想。在中国古代哲学中，所有精神、知识、智慧，感情、意志等都被看成是心的抽象活动中的部分。</p>
<p>②天体：宇宙中恒星、行星、卫星、彗星、宇宙尘、流星、星云等的总称，这里可解释成宇宙精神的本原。</p>
<p>③景星庆云：代表吉祥的星与云。在《汉书·礼乐志》中有：“甘露降，庆云出。”在《瑞应图》中有：“甘露，美露也，神灵之精，仁瑞之泽，其凝如脂，其甘如饴。”</p>
<p>④廓然：辽阔广大。</p>
<p>⑤太虚：天，天空，泛指天地。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人类的心体变化与天体相似，人的心体有喜悦的念头，就好比天空有吉祥喜庆的星星与云彩；人的心体有生气愤怒的念头，就好比大自然有响雷暴雨；人的心体有了慈悲的念头，就好比大自然有和风甘露；人的心体有了严厉的念头，就好比大自然有烈日秋霜。人有喜怒哀乐、慈悲邪恶的变化，自然有星云雷雨的变化，这些都不可缺少。人的心体变化也要像自然变化那样，随起随灭，心体保持清净，辽阔而没有阻碍，这样人的心体就能与天地相通了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人与自然相通，自然界的变化与人身心变化有相类似的地方。人有喜怒哀乐的情感，大自然有风云雷电的变化。人类的生活离不开自然界，自然界的变化对人类的生活具有决定性影响。老子说“人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然”，人与自然既有相通之处，人心当如自然，宽容豁达，无所不包。喜怒哀乐，随起随灭，不在心中滞留。</p>
<p>孔子曾用自然变化比喻人生道理。有一次，孔子站在岸边，望着滔滔不绝的江水，对弟子们说，见到大水你们一定要观看啊。弟子们就问为什么，孔子解释说水滋养万物，却不是为了自己，这样的行为好像是它有高尚的道德似的。水向下流去，好像是大义凛然一般、水汹涌奔腾没有尽头，好像坚持根本原则一样。如果决堤，水就会奔涌流出，好像是回响应声。它奔腾赶赴百丈深渊而没有什么畏惧，这种无所畏惧好像十分勇敢。人用水注入仪器之中来衡量地平面，一定是平直的，就好比执法根据准绳一样。水装满之后，不需要用刮平的工具去刮平，就好像是天生正直一般。它虽然纤小微弱，却好像无微不至，洞察一切事情一样。世间万物经过水的冲刷，必然会新鲜干净，这样就好像水善于教化万物一样。人世间的道理，与自然事物的运行规律以及特性等有许多相似相仿的地方。</p>
<p>在《庄子·知北游》中记录了舜与丞的对话。舜向丞请教：“道是可以获得并且可以拥有它的吗？”丞回答说：“就是你的身体，都不是你所能据有的，你又怎么能获得大道并且占有大道呢？”舜问：“我的身体不由我所有，那我的身体是归谁所有呢？”丞回答说：“这是天地把形体托付给你，你降生人世间并非就由你拥有这个形体，这是天地之间和顺之气凝聚而成的，你的性命也不是由你所具有，这也是天地把和顺之气凝结起来。你的子孙后代也不是你所拥有的，这是天地给予你的变形。”也就是说，一切都是自然的变化凝聚。</p>
<p>好利害显浅，好名害隐深</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>好利者，逸出①于道义之外，其害显②而浅：好名者，窜入③于道义之中，其害隐而深。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①逸出：超出，不在某范围之内。</p>
<p>②显：明显，显露。</p>
<p>③窜入：藏匿。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个贪图利益的人，他的所作所为超出道义的范围之外，危害明显且并不深入。一个贪图名声的人，他的所作所为隐藏在仁义道德之中，危害隐蔽且深远。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>贪图利益的人，容易被世人发现他的贪婪，因而世上人对他有了戒备之心，这样他所能造成的危害也就比较小了。而那些贪图名声的人，由于披着仁义道德的外套，世人也就不能轻易发现他的真面目。假仁假义的人，就好比蜜糖果的砒霜，最难让人防备。</p>
<p>战国时代，有一位高人，别人不知道他真实身份，也不知道他真实姓名，世人都称他为鬼谷子先生。鬼谷子不轻易收徒弟，只有那些与天资聪颖有悟性的人才能成为他的徒弟。在他的徒弟中，有一个叫孙膑的人很受鬼谷子喜爱。孙膑很优秀，才干与智慧都要超出其他人。庞涓也拜鬼谷子为师，向鬼谷子学习兵法。几年之后，庞涓要下山干一番事业。鬼谷子没有挽留他，同意他下山。孙膑没有跟着庞涓一同下山，他还要再学习几年。庞涓下山之后来到魏国，很受魏王重用，他也利用自己所学，在魏国立下不少功劳。庞涓在魏国虽然得意，心中却并不满意，因为他有一点心病没有消除。从前他跟着鬼谷子学习时，孙膑的学识才干胜过他，他想如果孙膑也下了山，那么自己势必打不过孙膑。后来庞涓想出一个好办法，他写了一封情真意切的信给孙膑。他说自己在魏国很受重用，他知道孙膑能干优秀，所以他向魏王保荐孙膑，希望能与孙膑共同辅助魏王，建立一番功业。孙膑收到这封信很高兴，他很感谢庞涓的推荐，于是便拜别老师鬼谷子，下山去找庞涓。孙膑来到魏国后，魏王本打算拜他为副军师，但是却被庞涓以种种理由阻止，魏王只给了孙膑一个小位置。后来庞涓总是在魏王面前讲一些不利于孙膑的话，最初魏王半信半疑。有一次，齐国使者来到魏国，听说孙膑很有才能，便想请孙膑到齐国发展，孙膑拒绝了齐国使者。庞涓却趁此机会对魏王说孙膑与齐国有勾结。魏王不问事实真相如何，就先把孙膑抓起来治罪。孙膑受尽折磨，膝盖骨被削去。庞涓装好人，对孙膑表示关心，他劝孙膑写兵书。其实庞涓早就想杀死孙膑，之所以还留着孙膑不死，就是想等孙膑写成兵书。庞涓想把这兵书据为己有，然后再杀死孙膑。孙膑识破庞涓的虚伪面孔，便装成疯子的样子骗过庞涓。后来孙膑在齐国使者的帮助下去了齐国，他在齐国受到重用，最终杀死庞涓报了仇。</p>
<p>月下吹箫图</p>
<p>机动见杀机，念息见真机</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>机动①的，弓影疑为蛇蝎②，寝石③视为伏虎，此中浑是杀气；念息④的，石虎⑤可作海鸥，蛙声可当鼓吹，触处俱见真机⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①机动：有心机，狡诈多疑。</p>
<p>②弓影疑为蛇蝎：把杯子中映出的弓影当成是蛇蝎等毒虫。形容人疑神疑鬼，自己吓自己。</p>
<p>③寝石：卧石。</p>
<p>④念息：各种欲念邪念消失。</p>
<p>⑤石虎：十六国时后赵武帝，生性残暴，好杀人，是一位暴君。据《辞海》：“晋后赵主石勒从弟，字季龙，骁勇绝伦，酷虐嗜杀，勒卒，子弘立，以虎为丞相，封魏王，旋虎杀弘自立，称大赵天王，复称帝，徙居邺，赋重役繁，民不堪命，立十五年卒。”</p>
<p>⑥真机：玄妙之理。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>有心机的人，能把杯子中的弓影看成是蛇蝎等毒虫，容易把伏着的石头当成是蹲着的老虎，内心中充满了杀气；心无杂念、心平气和的人，能把凶恶的石虎当成是温顺的海鸥，把聒噪的青蛙叫声当成是乐曲，能在自己接触到的东西中看出它的真谛。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>工于心计的人，因为自己心机很深，所以往往在看待他人他事的时候，也是百般揣摩，猜忌怀疑。疑神疑鬼，总怀疑别人对他使诈，怀疑别人有不良居心。三国时候的曹操就是一个心机深重，疑心病非常严重的人。他一生之中杀人过多，所以总是怀疑别人要谋害他。为此他告诫身边左右服侍自己的人，在自己睡着的时候千万不要靠近，因为自己喜欢在睡梦中杀人。他为了使这个说法更加可信，某天他装睡，故意杀死一个想为他盖被子的侍者。他还一番做作，假装不知道，等别人发现时，他假装伤心大哭，厚葬了这个侍者。这一来大家都知道曹丞相好梦中杀人，因此没人敢在他睡着的时候靠近了。</p>
<p>他的疑心病对于自己的儿子也不放过，自己的亲生儿子他也怀疑猜忌。曹操曾有一位非常聪明的儿子，名叫曹冲。有一个非常出名的故事“曹冲称象”，说的就是曹操的儿子想出一个非常巧妙的方法称出大象的重量。这位天才儿童曹冲寿命不长，没有成年就夭折了。曹冲死后曹操非常伤心，因为曹操一直很疼爱这个孩子。曹操的其他儿子曹丕等人劝父亲不要伤心，人死不能复生，保重身体要紧。结果曹操说：“你们的弟弟死了，是为父我的不幸，却是你们的大幸。”对于自己的亲生儿子，他也不忘怀疑猜忌。曹操有头疼的毛病，总是治不好，为此他非常烦躁。华佗是当时非常有名的医生，曹操让华佗为自己看病，华佗说要彻底根治这毛病，需要用斧子把头劈开，之后再把头缝好。曹操一听非常恼怒，认为华佗是存心想害死他，于是他就把华佗杀死了。杀死华佗，曹操的头疼病也就没人治了。</p>
<p>据专家研究发现，疑心病过重，经常算计别人的人其实是非常不快乐的。他们遇事非常能计较，内心深处缺乏坦然大方，时常处于焦虑之中。看待人或者事物，他们总是看到事物阴暗灰色的一面，处处担心，事事设防。这样最终结果使得自己生活得并不快乐。放下机心，以开阔的心胸看待事物，以坦诚豁达对待别人，这样能够看到许多生活中的美好。</p>
<p>心乱静中乱，心静乱中静</p>

<p>注释</p>
<p>①扰其中：心中充满困惑与迷惘。</p>
<p>②虚其中：心中没有杂念，心地干净。</p>
<p>③朝市：指热闹的地方。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>内心充满困惑迷惘的人，即使处在寒冷的深潭之中，也会感到波涛沸腾翻滚，处在深山老林中也无法感觉到寂静；心中没有杂念的人，在酷热的夏夜也能感觉到清凉，在嘈杂喧闹的街市也感觉不到嘈杂与喧嚣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“心静自然凉”，心中没有杂念困扰，自然心平气和。有一位书法家，有人请他写一幅字。这位书法家在写字的时候，他的朋友们在旁边站着看。朋友们边看边提出批评意见，这批评坦率又直接。每一幅字，他们总能提出很多意见，总之是写得不好，写得太差。这样一来，书法家越来越紧张，直感觉到朋友们热辣的目光都聚焦在他的笔尖下，他写的字就更加不好了。他越想写出一幅大家都满意的字，笔下的字就越是令大家都不满意。终于这些朋友们去吃饭了，只剩下书法家一个人。他想这下不用担心自己写得是不是令他们满意，书法家平心静气，自在地写完了一幅字。他的朋友们吃完饭，回来看到这幅字，都说这幅字写得真好。</p>
<p>平心静气去看待人与物，则许多令人烦躁的事情中也能发现一些美好。小周新搬了家，住在三楼。每天晚上，他都能听到楼上的人家拉琴。那琴声简直是“呕哑嘲哳难为听”，每次那琴声响起，小周就像被上刑一样难受。就像人们说的，不想听就找块棉花把耳朵堵上，小周真正这样实践了。每晚那琴声响起时，他就找了棉花塞住耳朵。但是这样不行，他依然还是能听到那让人心烦不已的琴声。他又想了别的办法，例如耳朵中塞上耳机听音乐，或者是放大电视的声音，但是那琴声仿佛有穿透力，总是能很成功地搅扰小周。小周想现在的家长，真是只顾望子成龙、望女成凤了，也不顾及一下邻居的感受。本来他是不打算去说的，就这样忍着算了。可是他忍耐了一段时间，实在忍耐不下去。于是他决定去楼上交涉，请他们家长想想办法，不要每天准时准点扰民。当小周敲开楼上的房门时，他发现楼上原来只住了一个老人。看样子这个老人年龄很大，她头发花白，皱纹很深，不过样子很慈祥。她笑眯眯地请小周进屋，客客气气请小周喝茶。这样一来，小周不好意思说什么了，和老太太聊了一会天，他了解到老太太只有一个女儿在外地工作，老伴早已经去世。老太太因为独自一个人住，感觉很无聊，所以她学琴自娱。小周坐了一会儿就告辞了，对这样一个孤独的老人，他实在不好意思说请她不要拉琴了。他决定忍耐算了。但是自从那晚他了解到老太太的情况后，再听那琴声，他突然发觉那琴声也不是那么不可忍耐。他渐渐能从那琴声中听出老太太的琴拉得越来越好了。</p>
<p>欲重吾生苦，性真吾生乐</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>羁锁①于物欲，觉吾生之可哀；夷犹②于性真，觉吾生之可乐。知其可哀，则尘情立破；知其可乐，则圣境自臻③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①羁锁：羁绊，束缚。</p>
<p>②夷犹：留恋，从容不迫。</p>
<p>③臻：达到。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>被自己的物欲束缚的人，会感觉到自己的生命很可悲；悠游在自己纯真本性中的人，才能发觉生命的可爱。知道被物欲束缚很可悲，那么世俗的情怀就可以消除；知道葆有纯真本性很可爱，那么崇高神圣的境界就会来到。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>苏东坡有首词叫《临江仙》：“夜饮东坡醒复醉，归来仿佛三更。家童鼻息已雷鸣。敲门都不应，倚杖听江声。长恨此身非我有，何时忘却营营。夜阑风静毅纹平。小舟从此逝，江海寄馀生。”词中所写，能引起很多人共鸣。很多人每天忙忙碌碌，却不知道自己究竟在忙什么。如果可能，相信许多人都想抛开一切，沉浸在自然之中，自由自在过生活。这当然只是一种理想，正因为它不容易实现，所以才令人们想起来时非常向往。虽然抛开一切羁绊不可能实现，但是适当减少生活中的种种束缚是可以实现的。仔细想来，其实生活中有很多事情是可以不做的。如果人们能适当减少自己的欲望，那么人生的负担与羁绊也就能减少许多。减少自己的物欲，葆有自己的真正本性，人生会快乐许多。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是在一个小镇上有一个蛋糕师。他做糕点的技术很高明，糕点花样种类多，美味可口。他做的糕点很受大家欢迎，渐渐他积攒了一些钱，于是自己开了一家蛋糕店，专门卖各种糕点。他的蛋糕店在当地非常有名，很多人都到他的店里买糕点，小店生意兴隆。几十年过去，他的小店依然如故。他的孩子们都已经长大成人，成家立业。有一天，孩子们回家来探望父母。学经济的女儿看着家里的蛋糕店，她说父母不会经营，这个蛋糕店几十年如一日，没什么变化。在现在的经济形势下，没有进步便是退步，迟早会被市场淘汰。女儿又说她可以为蛋糕店设计一套现代化管理方案，使得制作糕点需要花费的成小，以及卖糕点所取得的利润更加清晰明确。女儿说使用她这套管理方案，可以使店里花多少，赚多少，一目了然。孩子们想父母肯定不会拒绝这个建议，但是父亲却说不用了，他自己心中有数。这个蛋糕店虽然赚的钱不是特别多，但是足够维持老夫妻的生活。父亲说自己当初一无所有，这么些年过来，蛋糕店与老妻、孩子们都是他赚来的。老天待自己已经不薄，知足才能体会生活的快乐。</p>
<p>非粗无以精，非雅不免俗</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>金自矿出，玉从石生，非粗无以求精；道得酒中①，仙遇花里②，虽雅不能离俗。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①道得酒中：从喝酒中悟出某些道理。</p>
<p>②仙遇花里：在花丛遇见仙人。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>黄金是从矿石中提炼出来的，玉石是从石头中产生的，可见没有粗糙就不能获求精细；从喝酒中领悟道理，在花丛中遇见仙人，即使是高雅的事物，也不能完全脱离世俗。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>珍贵的黄金，精美的玉器，历来是人们想拥有的东西。人们欣赏它们的华美，感叹它们的珍贵，同时却容易忽视它们曾经历的磨砺。黄金并非生来就是如此光灿灿，玉石也并非生来就是如此精美。无论是黄金还是美玉，都曾经历一番锤炼，才变得如此珍贵华美。人也是如此，要想摘取成功的果实，必先经历一番磨砺。无论是哪行哪业，要想取得成功，都需要经过刻苦磨砺。</p>
<p>梅兰芳是我国非常有名的京剧表演艺术家，他在舞台上挥洒自如，往往一场戏唱下来，满堂喝彩，观众非常喜欢他的表演。虽然梅兰芳的表演给人带来很多快乐，使人们感觉轻松愉悦，但是他的学戏过程却是极其不轻松，吃过很多苦，受过许多磨炼。俗话说“台上一分钟，台下十年功”，一句道白，一招一式，一个眼神都有非常严格的要求。学戏要冬练三九，夏练三伏，一天都不能松弛。学生哪里做得不好，老师就是一顿狠打。每天早晨天刚亮就得起床，每个动作都得反复练，天天重复练。就是这样刻苦练习，才有了舞台上光彩耀人的梅兰芳。</p>
<p>艺术界成才需要刻苦，体育界成长更需要刻苦。中国首位获奥运会女子长跑冠军的运动员王军霞，她的成长历程说明了成功需要艰难困苦的锤炼。王军霞考入大连市中学时，她家离学校远。许多同学都是骑着自行车上学，王军霞也想骑自行车上学，但是这个愿望没法实现。因为当时家中很困难，买不起车。父亲知道女儿想拥有一辆自行车，可是无能为力。无奈之中，父亲建议她跑步上学，既可以节约时间，又能训练跑步。王军霞了解家里的困难，她点头赞同父亲的建议。从此以后，她每天跑步上学。刚开始，王军霞常被骑自行车的同学甩在后面，她坚持跑，渐渐她能赶上骑自行车的同学。就这样一直跑，王军霞练成了“飞毛腿”，在体育界大放光彩。</p>
<p>善于操身心，收放吾自由</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>白氏①云：“不如放身心，冥然②任大造③。”晁氏④云：“不如收身心，凝然归寂定⑤。”放者流为猖狂，收者入于枯寂。惟善操身心者，把柄在手，收放自如。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①白氏：指白居易，字乐天，唐代诗人和文学家，他的诗歌题材广泛，语言通俗易懂，代表诗作有《长恨歌》、《卖炭翁》、《琵琶行》等。</p>
<p>②冥然：玄默的样子。</p>
<p>③大造：天地，大自然。</p>
<p>④晁氏：指晁补之，字无咎，宋代巨野人，善于书画，因仰慕陶渊明而建造归来园，自号归来子。</p>
<p>⑤寂定：佛家谓心不驰散，保持安静不动的禅定状态。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>白居易说：“遇到事情放松身心去做，成败得失听凭自然。”晁补之说：“遇到事情要小心谨慎，这样能坚定信念不松弛。”放任身心容易使人陷入猖狂，事事约束身心容易使人陷入枯朽寂静。只有善于控制自己身心的人，才能自己掌控自己身心，做到收放自如。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>自己做自己的主人，放松与收敛全在自己掌握之中。遇到事情束手束脚不好，遇到事情一味放纵自由也不好，这两种态度对于处理事情都是有利也有弊把这两种方式结合起来使用，处理事情就能做到收放自如了。做人太过放纵自己，把握不好尺度就可能变成狂妄放肆之人，惹来世人厌恶；做人如果过于约束自己，也可能变得枯燥乏味，孤僻不合群。因此无论是做人还是处理事情，都需要有把握自己身心的能力。何时放松自己身心，何时收敛自己言行，全在自己掌握之中。</p>
<p>渔舟读书图</p>
<p>大哲学家黑格尔有一篇文章《马车声》这样写道：“一天上午，父亲邀我一同到林间散步，我高兴地答应了。父亲在一个弯道处停了下来。在短暂的沉默之后，他问我：除了小鸟的歌唱之外，你还听到了什么声音？我仔细地听，几秒钟之后我回答他：我听到了马车的声音。父亲说：对，是一辆空马车。我问他：我们又没看见，您怎么能分辨出是一辆空马车？父亲答道：从声音就能分辨出是一辆空马车。马车越空，噪音就越大。后来我长大成人，每当我看到口若悬河，粗暴地打断别人的谈话，自以为是，目空一切，贬低别人的人，我都感觉好像是父亲在我耳边说：马车越空，噪音越大。”过于放纵自己，如果没有深厚的知识积累与高尚的道德修养，很容易变成黑格尔文中所说的那种目空一切、放肆不羁的人。同样如果一个人过分约束自己，那么生活有可能变得过于沉重。有一个故事，说的是有一个人每天都过得不开心，他向老天抱怨，为什么我的生活这么苦。有一个神仙听到他的抱怨，向他建议说你把你背上的包袱打开，把里面不需要的东西扔掉，这样你就不会生活得这样苦了。这个人听了这个神仙的建议，便打开自己的背上的包袱，挑选了半天，哪一件都舍不得扔掉。神仙无奈地说：“你背上的包袱太沉重了，这样你怎么能过得轻松呢？”只有善于放松自己，扔掉不必要的包袱的人才能掌控自己的生活。</p>
<p>理寂则事寂，心空则境空</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>理①寂则事寂，遣事②执理者，似去影留形；心空则境空，去境存心者，如聚膻却蚋。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①理：道理，事理。事物的规律，是非得失的标准。中国古代有些思想家认为理是世界的本原。</p>
<p>②遣事：遣散、排除事物。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>事理与事物共存，事理不存在那么事物也跟着消亡，想舍弃事物而保留事理的人，就像是要去掉影子而保留形体那样不可行；人心虚空那么环境也跟着虚空，想排除环境影响保留内心空虚宁静的人，就像是一面聚集腥膻的东西一面又想驱除蚊子苍蝇一样。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>事物与道理共存，没有事物，也就没有事理；世间没有不蕴含事理的事物，事物与事理共生。世间本来不是绝对僵化的世界，静不是绝对的静，空也不是绝对的空。静是相对静，空是相对空。对于执着于追求事物道理的人，有时会忽视事物，只注重事物中的理。对于那些不注重事物蕴含道理的人，可能更重视事物本身，忽视事物所包含的道理。</p>
<p>从哲学上来说，无论是古代还是现代，许多哲学家争辩不已的基本问题都是物质与意识的关系问题，也可以说是事物与事理的关系问题。有些哲学家主张物质决定意识，有些哲学家认为意识决定物质。无论是物质决定意识，还是意识决定物质，两种观点都是将物质与意识放在一起来研究的。事物与事理的关系，人心与环境的关系，可以说就是在阐述物质与意识的关系问题。认为遣事执理者，是在去影留形，也就是把事物比作影子，把事理比作形体；认为舍弃环境保留虚心是聚膻却蚋，也就是把环境比作蚋等虫子，把存虚心比作聚集腥膻之物。这种观点虽然强调了事物与事理不可分开、心与境不可分，但是实质上是在强调精神性的东西更实在，更具有决定性作用。这种观点更加看重的是个人的修为，更强调人的精神、人的主观能动性的积极作用。</p>
<p>认识事物获得真理，不可脱离开事物。正如“道得酒中，仙遇花里”，追求真理须从具体事物中入手。如果脱离开具体事物去追求真理，就像人想舍弃自己身后的影子而保留自己的身体一样，是不可能实现的。保持内心宁静先由自身入手，而不是向外寻求宁静，心平气和则环境自然虚空清静。</p>
<p>无心不必观，物一何须齐</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心无其心，何有于观？释氏①曰：“观心②”者，重增其障；物本一物，何待于齐？庄生③曰：“齐物④”者，自剖其同⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①释氏：佛姓释迦的略称，亦指佛或佛教，这里指佛教。</p>
<p>②观心：观察心性。佛教以心为万法的主体，无一事在心外，故观心即能明了事理。也就是自我省察。</p>
<p>③庄生：庄子，名周。战国时著名思想家，道家学说的主要创始人，与老子并称为“老庄”。</p>
<p>④齐物：庄子认为从道的角度来看，生死寿夭、是非得失、物我彼此等都没有质的差别，万物本来一体。</p>
<p>⑤剖其同：剖，剖开。万物同为一体，那么“齐物”就是分割本来相同的事物。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>心中没有任何杂念邪思，又有什么必要观察自己内心、反省自己的行为呢？佛教说的观察反省，实际上为自己修行又增加了一层障碍。天地万物本来就是一体的，又有什么必要重新划为一体呢？庄子所说的消除万物差别，实际上是分割了本来是一体的万物。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>从来不犯错误的人很少见，常人多数会犯这样或那样的错误。孔子说犯了错误并不可怕，有过能改还是君子。人犯了错误，就要在内心中留有教训，以后以此为戒，控制提醒自己不要再犯同样的错误。犯了错误需要及时改正，如果不改正错误那才是真正的大错误。君子知错必改，只有小人犯了错误才会拼命掩饰。人们犯错误就像天上的日月有明暗圆缺，有错误的时候人们都能看得见，改正错误的时候人们同样能够看得见。大丈夫能够勇敢承认自己的错误，并且能时时反省，提醒自己少犯错误。儒家讲求时刻反省自身，佛教讲观察反省。</p>
<p>观察反省就是要时时扫除心中尘埃，使得心空无一物，一尘不染，保持本来清净。唐朝时，神秀和慧能在同一个寺中修行。某一天，五祖召开弟子大会，要选择接替他的人，使这个人成为禅宗第六代祖师。五祖大弟子神秀写了一首偈：“身是菩提树，心如明镜台。时时勤拂拭，勿使惹尘埃。”惠能听到后称赞好，又说虽然好还没有彻底了。慧能说自己也有一首偈，请别人帮他写出来。慧能念道：“菩提本无树，明镜亦非台；本来无一物，何处惹尘埃？”众人听了这首偈，都惊叹不已，通过这首偈子表现出慧能的领悟比神秀高，慧能对佛教教义领悟更为深刻。五祖传授慧能佛法，慧能为逃避神秀的迫害就逃到了南方修行。慧能说心中本来就是空无一物，那又怎么会沾惹尘埃呢。庄子的齐物论，认为天下万物本为一体，是非、生死、寿夭没有本质区别，物我彼此之分没有必要。万物本来是一体，也就没有必要再强调使得万物整齐划一。强调要使万物整齐划一，那么就在无形中承认万物存在差别，正因为有差别所以才有齐的必要。</p>
<p>现实生活中，我们可以参考佛儒道的修身方法。时时反省自身，有错改之无错加冕。保持心地清净，扫除世俗灰尘。看待事物不被它们的表面现象迷惑，世界上万事万物都是共性与个性的统一，这个世界是有差别的世界，同时又是具有共同特征的世界。</p>
<p>机息见风月，心远无尘迹</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>机息①时，便有月到风来，不必苦海人世：心远②处，自无车尘马迹③，何须痼疾丘山④？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①机息：停止使用心机。</p>
<p>②心远：心胸开阔，超越俗世。</p>
<p>③车尘马迹：指车马行过的痕迹。形容车马来往，喧嚣繁杂。</p>
<p>④痼疾丘山：痼疾，积久难以治愈的病。丘，小山。痼疾丘山指对山丘特别爱好。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>心中阴暗奸诈的念头消失时，就会有明月清风到来，从此不再为人世间的烦恼痛苦；心胸开阔、心境远离尘嚣，自然没有车马行过的喧嚣繁杂，何必非要偏爱山丘而隐居山林之中呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>心机深重的人，其实生活得很不自南。心机深的人往往疑心很重，以己度人，常会对别人的言行举止反复揣摩。自己心中多诡计，常疑神疑鬼，这样活得很累。心中常怀着若干心事，耗心费力，也不利于身体健康。更何况人虽然善于使心机，又怎么能比得过天。机关算尽未必能获得幸福，算计得了他人，算计不了天地。个人无论怎么样聪慧多智，毕竟智力有限，有时候费尽心机结果也未能如自己心愿，枉费了心机而已。</p>
<p>唐玄宗时期，李林甫受到皇帝的信任。李林甫其实是一个奸诈的人，他口蜜腹剑，说话时尽是甜言蜜语，使听的人都以为他是好人。其实他心中却怀着一肚子害人的诡计，他奉承得玄宗高兴，自己趁机会捞取各种好处。他家中极其奢华，各种财物堆积如山，府邸豪华奢靡。他因为自己好对别人使诈，所以常怀疑别人要来害他，每天出门提心吊胆，有若干人保护还不放心。每当夜晚休息时，他总怕别人来刺杀他，所以有时候一个晚上要换好几处住所。就是他的家人，也不知道他到底在哪里睡觉休息。这样整日生活在提心吊胆，预防猜忌别人当中，即使物质生活极尽奢华，也不见得快乐。心总悬着，自己对着自己都不能坦然相处，这样的生活着实累人。</p>
<p>所以与其活在计算他人的生活中，不如撇开心机，坦坦荡荡作人。凡事尽心尽力，不使阴谋诡计，顺其自然但求无愧于心，那么生活会简单得多也美好得多。心胸开阔、心境悠远，也就没有必要非得过隐居山林的生活。心远在哪里都能看得远，无论是在远离尘嚣的山林之中，还是在车马往来繁华喧嚣的尘世，心境开阔的人都能体会到自由。俗话常说傻人有傻福，心地纯良的人，不使用阴谋诡计算计别人，往往能获得意想不到的收获。心无城府，坦诚对待他人，也就看不到那么多人世间的阴暗面，即使看到了也往往向好的方面去看事情。</p>
<p>富贵德中来，自舒徐繁衍</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>富贵名誉，自道德来者，如山林中花，自是舒徐①繁衍：自功业来者，如盆槛中花，便有迁徙废兴；若以权力得者，如瓶钵中花②，其根不植，其萎可立而待矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①舒徐：舒，舒展、展开。徐，缓缓，缓慢。</p>
<p>②瓶钵中花：指插在花瓶里的花，由于没有根很快就会枯萎。瓶钵，僧人用具。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人的功名富贵，如果是从道德修养中得来的，那就像在山林中生长的花，自然绵延不绝地繁衍生长；如果是从建功立业中取得的，那就像花园中以及花盆中生长的花一样，会随着移植、搬动的变化而枯萎或茂盛；如果是以手中权力抢夺而来的，那就像插在花瓶里的花一样，由于根部不在土中，不久就会枯萎。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>虽然说荣华富贵转头空，可是荣华富贵确实有其不可比拟的吸引力。古往今来多少能干杰出的人才，为取得荣华富贵付出了极大代价。他们当中有些人并不是贪恋荣华富贵，之所以执着于荣华富贵，是因为取得富贵，光宗耀祖，也是个人能力的一种象征。这种能力又分为几等，一种是强取豪夺、仗势欺人的能耐，一种是纵横天下、建功立业的能力，还有一种是以德服人、以德服天下的能力。</p>
<p>荣华富贵如果是从强取豪夺中得来的，那么就像是花瓶中插的花，美则美矣，可惜美不了多久。没有收服人心，用不了多久就会有人起来反对。用权力获得富贵，当别人起来争夺掌握权力之后，那这富贵也跟着失去。没有人民的真心臣服与拥护，荣华高贵势必短暂。如果是通过自己努力，立下无数功劳、建功立业，这样取得的荣华富贵相对长久一些。而且因为是自己通过努力得来的富贵，享受这份荣华富贵时心中没有愧疚之感。尽管如此，这份富贵依然小能长久享有，时时有失去的危险。俗话说一朝天子一朝臣，谁也不能保证自己能得到所有皇帝的喜爱。当皇帝换人时，臣子往往也跟着换，受以前皇帝信任的臣子，未必能得到新皇帝的信任。这样一来，荣华富贵也就有了转手的危险。何况即使皇帝不换，这份功名也未必能长久拥有下去。俗话说伴君如伴虎，皇帝掌控生杀大权，一个不谨慎得罪了皇上，那么不仅荣华富贵保不住，项上人头也有可能丢。</p>
<p>孟子认为依靠道德，实行仁义政策，可使天下人真心归服。即使没有强大的国力，一样可以收服人心，使天下归服。商汤仅凭七十里的土地使天下归服，文王也仅凭纵横百里的土地收服天下。时代变迁，在当今社会中，道德的作用依然显著。无论从事哪行哪业，以德服人才能真正获得人心，获得人们的支持。有这样一个故事，说的是有一个美国人摩根，他成为一家小公司的股东。这是一家小保险公司。不久有一个在该保险公司投保的客户遇到了火灾，损失不小。按照规定赔偿，赔偿完这家保险公司就得破产了。股东们都想退股，谁也不想收拾残局。摩根先生仔细考虑后，筹集了一笔钱，收购了退股股东的股份。之后他把赔偿金发给了那个遇到火灾的客户。人们以为这个小保险公司会倒闭，出乎人们意料的是这次赔偿反而为公司赢得了良好信誉，抓住了人心。许多客户特意来这里投保，这个小保险公司渐渐发展成大公司。可见取得成功，守住事业，都需要有良好德行。</p>
<p>只以我转物，不以物役我</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>无风月花柳，不成造化①；无情欲嗜好，不成心体。只以我转物②，不以物役我③，则嗜欲莫非天机④，尘情即是理境⑤矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①造化：大自然，自然创造化育万物。</p>
<p>②以我转物：以自己为中心，操纵外物使其为我所用。</p>
<p>③以物役我：以外物为中心，人受外物控制役使。</p>
<p>④天机：天赋的灵机，天然的妙机。</p>
<p>⑤理境：通过叙事说理而体现的境界。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>自然界如果没有风月花柳等事物，也就不是创造、化育万物的大自然了；人类如果没有感情欲望以及各种嗜好，也就不是真正的人了。只能以我为中心来支配万物，而不能让外物来控制我，这样人的各种欲望嗜好成了天然灵机，世俗之情蕴含着玄妙理境。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>克制自己的欲望是必要的，但是在适当的条件下也应满足人的欲望。不顾一切灭绝人的欲望，是一种灭绝人类生气的做法。天地之间有风月花柳等景物，没有这些景物，大自然枯燥乏味不成自然。人类的各种欲望感情以及各种嗜好，是正常人都会有的。对于人类而言，有时候正是这些感情欲望推动人积极进取，灭绝人欲也就在一定程度上杀死了人的生机与活力。欲望需要克制，但是又不可以过分克制，掌握好一个尺度，那么就可以以自己为中心操纵万物，而不是被万物制服。</p>
<p>人生的各个方面都需要人有掌握万物，而不是被万物控制的能力。人类的各个行业都需要从业的人有控制局面，掌握外物的能力。三国时，曹操曾率领大军南下，准备灭了刘备，同时掌控东吴。刘备地盘小，可利用的士兵也少，不足以抵抗曹操大军。诸葛亮为刘备出了一个主意，他建议刘备联合东吴共同抗击曹操。刘备采纳诸葛亮建议，诸葛亮亲自到东吴说服孙权。孙权手下本分为两派，一派主和，另一派主战。孙权本已有心一战，在诸葛亮的一番积极鼓动之下，坚定决心，答应与刘备联合抗击曹操。刘孙两家的兵士共同迎战，与曹操的大军在赤壁相遇。曹操率领的大军，不适应南方的水土气候，一时间生病的兵士很多。而且曹军也不善于水上作战，曹军出师不利，受了挫折。周瑜与将士想出一条杀敌妙计，老将黄盖分析说曹军多是北方人，他们很不习惯水上作战，因此曹军将船只都连接在一起，这样可以减少船的颠簸，使他们少受晕眩之苦。曹军这样做了，也就给了对手可趁之机，假如使用火攻，那么船只连接在一起也就不利于分散灭火，周瑜认为这个建议可行，于是就决定采取火攻。赤壁之战，火烧曹营，曹军果然遇火难逃，伤亡惨重。孙权与刘备获得了胜利。这一场胜利，全靠周瑜诸葛亮等人善出妙计，能巧妙利用天时地利，使水火都为孙刘所用。</p>
<p>聘庞图</p>
<p>去心中冰炭，随地有春风</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天运①之寒暑易避，人世之炎凉难除；人世之炎凉易除，吾心之冰炭②难去。去得此中之冰炭，则满腔皆和气，自随地有春风矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①天运：大自然的运动变化。</p>
<p>②冰炭：冷与热，比喻心中矛盾斗争。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>大自然运动变化中的寒冷与炎热都容易躲开，人世间的世态炎凉却很难消除；即使人世间的世态炎凉能够消除，我们心中的冲突斗争也难以消除。如果能消除心中的矛盾斗争，那么心中充满祥和之气，自然能时时感觉如沐春风。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人们常感叹世态炎凉，感叹生活不容易，人与人相处常有各种误会，如何与人相处有时煞费苦心。俗话说“世事洞明皆学问，人情练达即文章”，世事人情确实是一门学问，想达到洞明与练达的程度，不是一朝一夕可以完成的。随着时间的流逝，人生经验越来越丰富，那么对于世事人情也就能有更深刻认识。有一位92岁高龄的老人，在谈及自己的人生经验时，她说幸福其实很简单。要拥有幸福，就不能过于计较，要有宽容豁达的气度。不要拿别人的错误惩罚自己，不要用自己的错误惩罚自己，也不要用自己的错误去惩罚别人。</p>
<p>古人说“人非圣贤孰能无过”，因为我们是凡人，所以难免会犯这样或那样的错误。假如自己犯了错误，就时时刻刻放在心上，心中好像有滚沸的开水与结冰的冰水在作战，时刻不得安宁。这样其实是没有必要的，犯错误真诚改正即可，没有必要时时刻刻拿自己的错误惩罚自己，搅扰得自己心神不宁，这样做实在是自己和自己过不去，自讨苦吃。</p>
<p>假如说以自己的错误惩罚自己是不明智的做法，那么以自己的错误去惩罚别人那就是不道德的做法了。自己犯了错误不思改正，反而死守着这个错误，去搅扰折磨他人，这样做对自己对他人都只有害处没有益处。有些人也许并不是出于本意去伤害别人，只是因为要保护自己就使得别人成了自己错误的牺牲品。也有人自己已认识到错误，只是出于虚荣心好面子，不肯承认错误，无形中伤害了别人。无论是伤害别人的人，还是被别人伤害的人，都不会感觉到快乐。用自己的错误去折磨别人，这是一种损人不利己的行为。提醒自己勤于改正错误，不以自己的错误折磨别人，这样做需要有宽容的心态。</p>
<p>不用别人的错误惩罚自己，也是一种明智选择。需要有宽容豁达的心态，才能做到从容面对生活，无论别人怎么样对我，即使他人对我失礼，那是他人的过错，我没必要为此难过。保持宽容的心态，心中的冰炭也就自然消失，生活如沐春风。</p>

<p>①贫士：贫穷的士人。</p>
<p>②性天：天性，指人得于自然的本性。</p>
<p>③惠泽：惠爱与恩泽。</p>
<p>④闹场：喧闹的环境。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>贫穷的士人能够帮助别人，这才是天性中具有的恩泽；能够在吵闹的环境中学习，这才是心灵深处的本领。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>假如一个人自己拥有许多财富，拿出一些来帮助别人，这是值得称赞的行为。然而假如一个人自己都处于贫困之中，当遇到别人需要帮助时，还能伸出援手，帮助他人，这样的行为就更值得称颂了。林则徐是一位民族英雄，他虎门销烟的事迹光耀史册。少年时候的林则徐，家庭生活是清苦的。他虽然出生在一个知识分子家庭，但是祖父与父亲都以教书为业，收入非常有限。他的母亲与姐妹们时常做一些针织刺绣的活计来补贴家用。家中过得很俭省，平常家里油灯只点一根灯芯，过大年的时候才有两根灯芯。素炒豆腐算是美味佳肴，平时不能够吃到，只有在过年的时候才能吃顿素炒豆腐。有时候没有钱买油灯芯，林则徐不得不去当铺当衣服买灯芯，这样才能在夜里继续读书。林则徐还曾经做过兼职，为知县抄写一些东西，换取一点钱贴补读书费用。就是这样的清苦生活中，林则徐的父母还时常帮助他人。当别人遇到疾病葬殓等困难时，林则徐父母会竭尽所能帮助他人，虽然他们自己家中也十分清贫。林则徐小时候曾经看到父亲把家里的米送给一贫如洗的亲戚，父母却忍着饥饿，并且告诫林则徐不要让那位亲戚知道林家也没有余粮。</p>
<p>假如有一个清静舒适的学习环境，人们在这样的环境中清心读书，取得好成绩，这还不算是特别出色。真正考验一个人能力的是在吵杂的环境中，看他是不是还能够静下心来学习，不受外物干扰。如果在喧闹的环境中，不受喧闹的影响，能坚持自己的信念，专心读书学道，这样的人才是真正有本领的人。求学时候的毛泽东，曾经故意在闹市中读书。街市中最热闹嘈杂的地方，他就找一个地方坐下，在那里读书。以此来培养自己看书时静心的习惯，培养自己不受外界干扰的坚强意志。人们都希望能有一个清静的读书学习环境，如果现实中没有这样的条件，那也不能荒废懈怠，可以培养自己在喧闹中学习的能力与意志。</p>
<p>小处不渗漏，暗处不欺隐</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>小处不渗漏①，暗处不欺隐，末路不怠荒②，才是真正英雄。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①渗漏：渗，液体慢慢地透入或漏出。渗漏指气体或液体通过孔隙流失。</p>
<p>②怠荒：荒废懈怠，没有上进心。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>细微的地方不疏忽，在别人看不到的地方不做见不得人的事情，穷困潦倒时不荒废懈怠，如果能做到这些，才是一个真正的英雄人物。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>遇到非常重要的事情，人们往往会采取非常谨慎的态度对待，而当遇到不怎么重要的细微小事时，人们容易放松警惕，由此容易犯错误。从一个人对待细微小事的态度上可以看出这个人品质如何。假如一个人无论是面对重要大事，还是面对不怎么重要的小事，都能保持仔细认真态度，那么这个人至少是一个可靠的人。有这样一个故事，说的是一个刚毕业的年轻护士，参加了一个著名医生主刀的手术。这个医生资格很老，是他专业领域里的权威，很多人都争抢着请他诊治。这个小护士的工作是帮着清点所有的手术器械与辅料。当手术结束之后，小护士对老医生说，我刚才清点了只有10块消毒棉，您在手术时使用了11块消毒棉，所以还有一块消毒棉我们必须找到。老医生说：消毒棉我都取出来了，现在开始缝合。老医生的声音虽然不大，却很有自信，话语中饱含着不可抗拒的权威性。小护士有点胆怯，但是她仔细想了一想，坚持说还有一块消毒棉必须找到，现在不能进行缝合。她话语中虽然流露着怯意，态度却是非常坚决。老医生慈祥地笑了，看着小护士，他伸展开自己的手，手中握着第11块消毒棉。这是一场事先安排好了的考验，小护士通过了考验。一块消毒棉虽小，却可以看出一个人的职业道德如何。</p>
<p>人生得意之时，当积极进取。人生失意之时，更当积极进取，不可以自己懈怠荒废。时值失意潦倒，更能看出一个人的品行。遇到不如意就自怨自艾、自我放弃，这样的人恐怕难以取得大成功，不具有坚实可靠的优秀品质。真正的英雄人物，无论身处怎么样的环境，都能保持始终如一的优秀品质。有一个故事说的是有一个老师，在开始上课之前先拿出一张五十元钞票，问学生你们谁愿意要这张钞票。学生不知道老师是什么意思，但是都纷纷举起手来。老师把这张钞票用力揉成一团，问学生们谁还想要这张钞票。学生们依然纷纷举手，老师说稍等一下，我就把这张钞票送给你们中某一个人。他把这张钞票扔到地上，用脚用力踩它，直到这张钞票变得又脏又破，然后他捡起来这张钞票，问学生现在谁还想要这张钞票。学生们依然纷纷举手。老师说：无论这张钞票如何破旧，它依然受人欢迎，因为它还是五十元，没有因为破旧就贬值。对于一个品格高尚、品质优良的人来说，无论环境如何，他纯良的品质不会因此变化。</p>
<p>喜奇无远识，苦节须恒久</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>惊奇喜异者，终无远大之识①；苦节独行者，要有恒久之操②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①识：见识，志向。</p>
<p>②操：行为，品行。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>喜欢奇怪异常事物的人，没有远大的见识与志向；坚守节操，不被世俗污染的人，要有能长久坚持的品行。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>喜欢奇怪异常事物的人，没有深远宏伟的志向与见识。也就是说有高深远大见识与志向的人，表现恰恰很平常。他们没有怪异之处，第一眼看过去只觉得平淡无奇，相处久了才了解他们的不平凡之处。有一个记者曾经打算去采访居里夫人，他打听到居里夫人的大概住所。到了那里之后，他找人问路，这个时候看到一个看上去很平凡的妇女低着头干活，于是记者上前问路。这个妇女抬起头来，记者才发现她就是居里夫人。有不平凡成就的伟大人物，有时候往往不愿意让自己表现怪异，也不愿意炫耀自己，他们的表现比平常人更加显得平常。</p>
<p>只是在这种平凡之中，显现的是人类的优良品质，也是有自信的一种表现。正因为有自信，所以不会凭借着奇特怪异来使得自己与众不同。追求奇特怪异事物的人，在某种程度上来说，正是他们不够自信的表现。曾经有一个大一学生，新学期开学报到，他带了大包小包的行李，刚到学校找不到地方。这个学生很焦急，这个时候他看到一位老人，老人衣着朴素，看上去挺慈祥。于是这个学生就请这位老人帮忙，请老人帮他看着行李。老人很痛快地答应下来，并且让这个学生放心去办事。这个学生办完了自己的事情后，已经过了很长时间，他想着帮他看行李的老人，赶快走回去找。结果发现老人还在那里帮他看行李，手里拿着一本书，看得津津有味。这个学生向老人表示谢意，老人告诉他新生宿舍在哪里。后来这个学生才知道，这个平易近人的老人就是有名的学者季羡林先生。</p>
<p>伟大是蕴藏在平凡之中，生活的真谛恰恰在平凡之中显现。坚持良好的德行，需要有耐久坚持的意志。假如开始拥有良好品行，结果半途而废，良好德行不能坚持下去，还不如最初不要选择孤独苦修的道路。如果选择了孤独苦修的道路，就要有一直坚持下去的准备，要养成坚强意志。</p>
<p>高士观瀑图</p>
<p>怒欲处转念，邪魔变真君</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>当怒火欲水正腾沸时，明明知得，又明明犯着。知得是谁？犯着又是谁？此处能猛然转念，邪魔①便为知真君子②矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①邪魔：妖魔，此处指各种欲念。</p>
<p>②真君子：真正的君子，指真正人格高尚的人。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当一个人怒火上升欲念翻滚的时候，虽然自己也知道这样是不对的，可是他控制不了自己。知道这个道理的是谁呢？明明知道却故意触犯的又是谁呢？假如在这个紧要关头能够转变念头，那么邪恶的魔鬼也会变成真正的君子了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>生活中有很多道理，往往是知易行难。知道某个道理是正确的，但是在实践中往往不能控制自己，不能使得自己按照正确的道理去生活。认识道理不难，难就难在把道理付诸实践行动。古语说“知之非艰、行之惟艰”，说的就是认识道理不是很难，把道理付诸实践行动就比较困难了。有很多人，喜欢给自己书写一个大大的“忍”字作为自己的座右铭。生活中确实有很多时候都需要一个“忍”字。有时候人们怒火沸腾，理智蒸发得无影无踪，冲动之下也许会做出一些事情，而这些事情在自己清醒之后会后悔万分，假如能够在怒火沸腾的时候想起一个“忍”字，那么后来的悔恨也就能避免了。</p>
<p>在很多场合下，忍耐一下，事情的结果就会改变。有这样一则故事。讲的是在一个周末，在一个人与车的流量非常大的路段上，有一辆公交车被堵在十字路口。公交车里面人非常多，大家挤在一起，天气闷热，很多人变得烦躁易怒。等了一段时间，终于等到绿灯，司机发动汽车，这时候有些乘客没有扶好，随着车开动跌倒，撞到了旁边的人。一个年轻的小伙子被另一个穿红色运动服的小伙子撞了一下，被撞的小伙子有些不耐烦地喊了一声“哎呀”。随着这一声“哎呀”，穿红色运动服的小伙子挥起拳头，照着被撞的小伙子脸上就是一拳。这一拳把被撞小伙子的眼镜打飞，眼眶打出血来。车里的人都愣住了，大家实在想不到穿红色运动服的小伙子会打人，而且下手居然还这么狠。车停了，打人的小伙子扯着被打的小伙子下车，要被打的小伙子和他去医院包扎。无论是打人的还是被打的，都只有损失。一个皮肉受苦，浪费时间。另一个花费时间与金钱，且会受到一定惩罚。如果当时双方都能忍耐一下，结果就不会是这样。虽然过错主要在那个穿红色运动服的小伙子身上，被打的小伙子最初那声非常不耐烦的“哎呀”也是诱因。</p>
<p>在生活中，人们大多能认识到克制怒火以及克制自己各种欲望的必要性，但是往往事到临头时不能真正克制自己。这就需要我们不仅认识道理，更要把正确的道理落实到实际行动中。</p>
<p>一念犯鬼神，言行须谨慎</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>有一念而犯鬼神之忌①，一言而伤天地之和，一事而酿②子孙之祸者，最宜切戒③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①忌：忌讳。</p>
<p>②酿：本意是酿酒，这里是指酝酿与造成的意思。</p>
<p>③切戒：深刻引以为戒。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>有时候一个不良念头就可能触犯鬼神的忌讳，有一句话说得不对就可能破坏人世间的和气，有一件事做得不恰当就可能为子孙后代惹来祸事。这些都要深深引以为戒。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在生活中，很多时候都需要我们谨慎为人处世。一个不小心就有可能给自己生活带来损失，引起别人误会，严重的还可能酿成大祸。有这样一个故事，说的是有一个刚参加工作的年轻人小黄。小黄性格比较粗枝大叶，对许多事情都不够仔细。他所在的单位是一所中学，校长要把这所学校办成名校，所以对老师与学生的要求都非常严格。每一次考试，不论是大考还是小考，考完之后都要进行成绩比拼。及格率、优秀率以及平均分，从这三个点进行比拼，成绩好的教师受到赞扬，成绩不好的教师就要受批评甚至要写检讨。在这样的情形下，老师们对考试都非常重视。每次听到要考试的通知，大家都开始努力准备，一有时间就给学生上课。学生只要稍有空闲，就有可能被各科老师叫到办公室去，被监督着学习。每次考试，无论是大考还是小考，可以用“如临大敌”来形容老师与学生们。</p>
<p>在这样的环境中，小黄仿佛有些格格不入。他觉得无论是考试还是不考试，都应该使自己的教学有一定的计划，按照计划稳步进行，而不是一遇到考试就突击学习。他觉得突击学习不利于学生牢固掌握知识，而且小黄还认为频繁的考试对于学生学习是不利的。在这样的认识下，每次遇到考试，小黄总是不紧不慢不会特别准备。他教的学生考试成绩不是最好，也不是最差，处在中等水平。所以每次考完，分析成绩的大会上，小黄不会受到表扬也不会受严厉批评。小黄办公桌的对面是白老师，白老师很重视考试，他教的学生成绩非常好。</p>
<p>有一次，年级组长打电话过来，通知下个月某天要进行考试，这次考试是校长特意安排的，老师们都没有准备。年级组长要大家准备一下，不要临时慌乱。小黄接的电话，听了年级组长的通知，当时就向大家转述了电话内容。因为当时办公室里人很齐全，小黄通知过后也就把这件事情忘在脑后了。但是那天白老师请假不在，也就不知道要考试的事情。过了一段时间，白老师看到别的学科老师在忙着准备考试，于是问大家是不是要考试了，听到别人说是小黄通知大家考试的事情。这样一来，白老师对小黄就有了意见，他认为小黄为了在考试竞争中胜出，所以故意不告诉自己要考试的事情。小黄虽然完全没有这个念头，但是忘了通知白老师确实是自己不对，而且自己也知道辩解也不足以令人信服，只好忍耐下来，从此小心注意从别的事情上弥补。</p>
<p>不为世法染，气味迥然别</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>山肴①不经世人灌溉，野禽不受世人豢养②，其味皆香而且洌③。吾人能不为世法④所点染，其臭味⑤不迥然别乎！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①山肴：肴，熟鱼肉等。此处山肴指山间野生的食物，如菌类、竹笋等。</p>
<p>②豢养：饲养。</p>
<p>③洌：醇厚浓烈。</p>
<p>④世法：指世间功名利禄以及各种欲念。</p>
<p>⑤臭味：气味，指人的品位与趣味。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>山间野菜没有经过人们的栽培灌溉，野外的动物没有受到人们的饲养，它们的味道浓香醇厚。我们人不被人世间功名利禄以及各种欲念所污染，那么品位、趣味与德行必定与那些受到污染的人有明显区别。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>大自然中的植物与动物，没有经过人类的培植与驯养，保持着自然纯净，其味道格外鲜美。这里强调了自然的事物最好，无拘无束自由生活的可贵。人类的生存与发展离不开大自然，人类本身也是自然长期发展的产物。当人类发展到一定阶段，人类各个方面都有了比较完善的发展之后，在一定程度上人工的胜过自然的。现代化生产与生活，使得人们崇尚科技发展，崇拜先进高端技术。人类发展到今天，科学技术的重要性已不言而喻，但是与此同时，人们也发现保护自然非常重要。人类的发展离不开自然，无论科学技术怎样发展，都是以自然为基础。于是在当今社会中，人们又开始在生活中崇尚自然。</p>
<p>肯定自然为贵，不是否定发展科技与普及教育的重要作用，而是在承认教育科技以及人类社会其他各个方面成就的前提下，提倡自然为贵。如今在人类生活的方方面面，都可见到人们崇尚自然。人类的食物，天然的要比非天然的更受人们欢迎。在菜市场中，随处可见号称无污染纯天然的肉菜价格更高，更受顾客欢迎。服装市场中，天然对人体无危害的衣饰更受人们青睐。选择住房时，人们将住房周围是否有绿色植物，居住环境是否良好无污染作为选择住房的重要条件。总之人们在生活的各个方面都开始重视自然，崇尚追求自然。</p>
<p>有一所办公大楼，楼前铺设的人行道很受人们称赞。建筑师在设计铺设人行道时，没有在大楼完工之后立刻让人铺设人行道。他让工人们在大楼之间的空地上全部种上草。几个月过去之后，通向大楼的草地被人们踩出了几条小道。这几条小道弯弯曲曲，很是别致。建筑师就让工人们以这几条小道为准，铺设了人行道。这几条人行道自然别致，有的宽些，有的窄些，不拘一格而又自然有序。既有实际用处，而又自然优美，充分体现了自然的东西最可贵。</p>
<p>春泉小隐图</p>
<p>劝学篇</p>
<p>子路未拜孔子为师之前，性情乖张，桀骜不驯，看不上像孔子这样的酸儒文人。孔子问他：“你有何爱好？”子路回答：“我爱好长剑。”孔子说：“我不是问你这个。我是说，以你所能，加之以学，谁人可赶得上你！”子路问：“学亦有益吗？”孔子说：“人君无谏臣则失政，士无教友则失听。狂马不释其策，操弓不反于檠（qíng）。木受绳则直，人受谏则圣。接受学问，哪个不会成功？不讲仁义，憎恨士人，则近于刑。君子不可以不学。”可子路又说：“南山有一种竹子，不用加工就自然会变直，砍断而用弓箭射出去，能射穿犀牛皮。它又学了什么呢？”孔子说：“把竹子捆扎在一起并饰以羽毛，削尖头部并打磨一下，这样竹子射入犀牛皮不会更深吗？”子路恍然意识到学习的重要性，方才向孔子拜师学习。</p>
<p>就连老子也说：“求学问的人，知识天天都有长进；修道德的人，情欲天天都在减失。”学习不光是学习知识，还需要一种态度。有了正确的态度，才能从周围，从各种载体和途径去倾听，去领悟，进而获得自己需要的东西。</p>
<p>仔细分析。不难得知，学习的开始是从搜寻开始的。倾听和领悟是过程，总结是最后的结果。谦虚积极的学习态度，就像一根线将所有环节串联成一串项链。这串项链的存在与否完全依靠的是这根线。</p>
<p>玄默宁真体，恬愉养圆机</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>纷扰①固溺志②之场，而枯寂亦槁心③之地。故学者当栖心④元默⑤，以宁吾真体；亦当适志恬愉，以养吾圆机⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①纷扰：纷纷扰扰，混乱的样子。</p>
<p>②溺志：使自己心志沉溺其中。</p>
<p>③槁心：心气枯槁，形容人丧失活力，缺乏生气。</p>
<p>④栖心：栖，寄托。栖心，寄托心志。</p>
<p>⑤元默：玄默，形容清静无为。</p>
<p>⑥圆机：圆通机变，超脱、不被外物羁绊。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>纷乱骚动同然沉溺人心志，而枯燥寂寞也是使人心丧失活力的地方。所以求学的人应当寄托心志于清静，以此来使自己的真实本性获得安宁；也应当适应自己的志趣恬淡愉悦，以此来培养自己圆通机变。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>学习也需要有正确学习态度，纷纷扰扰的环境固然会使人烦乱，从而不能专心于学习，枯燥寂寞也容易使人丧失活力，不利于人们学习。由此可见，学习既需要有刻苦专心、能静下心来的态度，也需要适当放松自己，使得自己保持活力，以更大精力投入学习中。也就是说学习既需要有不怕吃苦的态度，甘愿坐冷板凳的决心与志气，同时还需要有适当的娱乐与爱好。一个学生果只知道读书，缺乏其他爱好与能力，也就会变成一个书呆子。现代社会需要各种人才，只会读书的人不能够满足社会的需求。一个学生如果没有使自己静下心学习的能力，那么在学习上不会有所长进。</p>
<p>从前在荷兰某个小镇有一个青年人，他找到一份门卫的工作，替镇政府看门。他在这个岗位上工作了几十年，一直没有换工作。对于一个年轻人来说，门卫的工作有些枯燥清闲，这个年轻人就学习打磨镜片。他静下心来专注细致地打磨镜片，磨了又磨，就这样几十年的时间过去了，他磨镜片的技术达到高级技师的水平。他用自己打磨的镜片，发现了一个广阔新天地，那就是微生物世界。他在科学史上留下了自己大名，他就是荷兰科学家万·列文虎克。几十年如一日，坚持在一件事情上不断研磨，这需要有坚强意志与不怕吃苦的精神。</p>
<p>适当培养某些健康爱好，学会放松身心，对于学习非常有利。一些教育家研究发现，那些在社会上有所成就的人，当他们在学校学习时，学习成绩并不都是出类拔萃的，其中有一些人成绩只能算是中上游。教育家同时还发现，这些人当学生时并不是只知道学习的学生，他们其他方面的爱好很广泛，而且也乐于与其他同学交往。教育家还发现，有一些在学校学习时考试成绩数一数二的学生，当他们走向社会时，渐渐默默无闻，没有什么大的成就。这个现象表明了全面发展，培养健康爱好非常重要。学习需要有刻苦精神，也需要学会适当放松身心。</p>
<p>心是一明珠，畏理障难除</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心是一颗明珠，以物欲障蔽①之，犹②明珠而混以泥沙，其洗涤③犹易；以情识④衬贴⑤之，犹明珠而饰以银黄⑥，其涤除最难。故学者不患⑦垢病，而患洁病之难治；不畏事障⑧，而畏理障⑨之难除。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①障蔽：遮盖，遮挡。</p>
<p>②犹：好比。</p>
<p>③洗涤：清洗。</p>
<p>④情识：感觉与认识，也指情欲与情性。</p>
<p>⑤衬贴：衬托。</p>
<p>⑥银黄：白银和黄金。</p>
<p>⑦不患：不担心。</p>
<p>⑧事障：佛教用语，佛家讲贪嗔痴等，是达到涅槃的障碍。</p>
<p>⑨理障：佛教用语，指邪见等阻碍真知、真见。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人的心是一颗明亮的珠子，用各种物质欲望遮蔽它，就好比明珠混杂着泥土与沙石，清洗还比较容易；用情感认识衬贴明珠，就好比明珠装饰了黄金白银，清洗就很困难了。所以读书人不怕沾染上不洁的毛病，而怕患上心理洁癖的毛病；不怕做事情遇到障碍，而惧怕思想上遇到的障碍难以消除。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在求学的道路上，各种邪思杂念以及各种物质欲望都不是最大的障碍，最大的障碍是人心中存在一些偏见、思想中存在一些错误的观念。如果人们能消除偏见，消除错误观念，那么在学习中能取得不断进展。如果有些人过于固执，抱着自己的偏见与错误思想不肯放手，不肯改正，那么在求知的道路上势必不能走远。</p>
<p>有学问的学者们有时候会很固执，尤其是涉及到他们的专业领域，他们会变得格外固执，不会轻易改变自己已有观点。这可以说是既有益处，也有弊端。如果自己坚持的认识观点是正确的，那么这种坚持就是坚持真理，是值得称赞的。但是假如自己坚持的理论观点是错误的，那么这种坚持就是坚持错误而不肯悔改，这种做法是错误的。在科学史上坚持真理的科学家有很多，同时也有一些人坚持的并不是真理。艾伦斯特·马哈，生于1838年，死于1916年，曾经担任过维也纳大学物理学教授。他曾经公开表示不承认爱因斯坦的相对论，同时还表明正如他也不承认原子存在一样，他认为爱因斯坦的相对论不合理。</p>
<p>水阁读书图</p>
<p>一个人随着自己经验与知识的日益丰富，在学习新知识时，已有的经验认识既可以为新知识的领悟掌握提供便利，也有可能成为学习道路上的障碍。有这样一个笑话，说的是有一个博士去商店买东西。因为他经常来这家商店，和老板混熟了，老板就出了一个脑筋急转弯的题考他。老板说：“有一个聋哑人到商店买东西，他和店员比划着自己要买的东西，这店员拿各种东西给他，聋哑人挑选了自己要买的东西就离开了。过了一会儿，进来一个瞎子，他要买牙刷，他该怎么表达他的意思呢？”博士正思考着这个瞎子该怎么比划，老板哈哈大笑说：“博士，这还用想吗？瞎子买东西，可以直接告诉店员他要买什么。”博士不好意思地说自己确实想多了。老板笑说：“读书太多的人，反而会变得不太聪明。”老板的话不一定恰当，但是假如已有知识成为自己获得新知识的拦路障碍，那么确实读书越多反而越不聪明了。</p>
<p>功夫难处做，学问苦中得</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>功夫自难处做去者，如逆风鼓棹①，才是一段真精神；学问自苦中得来者，似披沙获金，才是一个真消息②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①鼓棹：划桨。棹，船桨。</p>
<p>②消息：真谛，奥妙。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>各种功夫本领要从难处练习提高，就好比逆着风划船，这才是一种真精神；做学问要有吃苦耐劳的精神，就好比在沙里淘金，这才是获得知识学问的真谛。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人无论从事哪个行业，要想在某个领域有所成就，都需要有吃苦耐劳的精神。古今中外有杰出成就的人，都是吃苦耐劳的人，我国排球名将郎平，在体育界取得辉煌成就，一方面是由于她在体育方面有一些天赋，另一面是她有不怕吃苦的精神，这种不怕吃苦的精神是她取得成功最重要的因素。平时训练极为艰苦，她每天天刚亮就起床，锻炼体能，练习排球。她身上经常被球砸得青一块、紫一块，有时候疼得她直掉眼泪。运动员的训练不能三天打鱼两天晒网，要想有所成就，就必须坚持训练，不能有所停顿。正是这种坚持不懈的艰苦训练使得郎平最终在体育界大放光彩。</p>
<p>学习知识、掌握某项技能，如果从难处下手，那么遇到容易的地方也就势如破竹。有一位很有名的钢琴家，他对学生要求非常严格。有一个跟着这位钢琴家学琴的男生，先天条件较好，钢琴家对他要求格外严格。每当这个学生有了进步时，这位钢琴家对他不是表扬，而是拿给他一个琴谱。这琴谱内容对于这个男孩而言，实在是太难了。最开始这个男孩难免会抱怨，当他发现抱怨没有用时也就开始专心研究琴谱。开始他觉得很难，渐渐的他发现这些琴谱也没有那么难了，他的水平逐渐提高。有一天，钢琴家请学生弹奏他第一次给学生的那首曲子。学生演奏完毕后，他惊奇地发现从前自己觉得非常难的曲子竟然变得很简单。钢琴家说这正是我让你练习非常难的琴谱的原因所在，从难处入手练习，那么相对容易的部分就能很轻松被掌握。学习正是如此，如果目标高，从难处人手，那么取得的成就也会相应高。当然从难处入手学习不是要否定循序渐进的学习规律。学习知识需要遵循循序渐进的学习规律，与从难处入手学习并不矛盾。每个人的情况不同，在学习过程中可以根据自己的实际情况制定相应目标。</p>
<p>事理自悟明，意兴自得妙</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>事理因人言而悟者，有悟还有迷，总不如自悟之了了①；意兴②从外境而得者，有得还有失，总不如自得之休休③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①了了：聪明，清楚明白。</p>
<p>②意兴：兴趣，乐趣。</p>
<p>③休休：安闲得意的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>通过别人的解释明白事物的道理，有明白的地方也会有迷惑的地方，总不如自己参悟获得道理那样更明白清楚；从外部环境中获得某种意趣，有得也会有失，总不如从自己内心中产生某种意趣更惬意自在。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在学习中，通过别人的讲解获得知识总是有限的。学习需要学会独立思考，学会自己思考问题并且提出问题。诺贝尔奖获得者李政道教授曾经说过：“求学问，需学问；只学答，非学问。”能够提出问题，先要经过一番仔细思考。如果只靠别人提出问题，并且解答问题，这会使得学习者自己非常被动。研究发现，学习成绩非常好的学生，他们都是很会学习的学生。这种会学习是说他们能够主动学习，主动思考问题，主动去发现问题并提出问题。只靠老师或者家长布置学习任务，靠老师和家长讲解来掌握知识的学生，他们的学习成绩达不到非常优秀的程度。哲学上讲内因与外因对于事物的发展所起的作用是不同的，内因对于事物发展起决定作用。对于学习者来说，老师与家长等是外因，学习者自己才是内因。能否在学业上有所成就，决定性的因素还在于学习者自己。也就是说靠别人讲解获得知识，不如靠自己独立思考获得知识更清楚明白。强调自己独立思考的重要性，并不是要否定别人讲解知识的作用。学习一方面要靠学习者自己独立思考，另一方面也需要他人的讲解以及与他人交流，这两者之间并不矛盾。</p>
<p>由于外部环境的影响产生某种兴趣，或者感受到惬意自在，当外部环境变化时，这种兴趣与自在的感觉也就会跟着变化。如果某种兴趣以及惬意的感觉是从自己内心中产生，不受外部环境的影响，那么这种兴趣以及美好的感觉会存在得更为长久。当人们身处在一个鸟语花香、繁花满径的环境中时，多数会油然而生愉快的感觉。当人们处在一个非常恶劣的环境中时，心情往往也跟着变得很不愉快。自己的兴趣心情受到外部环境的影响，在一定程度上来说也就有些不自由。如果是从自己内心中产生的某种兴趣、愉快的感觉，不会受到外部环境的影响，相比之下更为自由自在。</p>

<p>②并归一处：合并在一个地方，即专心致志。</p>
<p>③事功：事业。</p>
<p>④实谊：实实在在的造诣成就。</p>
<p>⑤风雅：风流儒雅。诗经分为“风、雅、颂”三部分，因此风雅也指诗文。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>学习的人需要收拾散漫精神、排除杂念，集中精神、专心致志从事学习。如果想培养良好德行同时又关心功名利禄，那么必然小能取得实在成就；如果读书把兴趣放在诵读诗词、讲究风雅上，那么必定不能取得深刻心得。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“一分耕耘一分收获”，如果没有耕耘，哪里来收获。学习正是如此，如果没有刻苦努力，也就不能在学习上取得进步。三心二意，心思散漫，对于学习来说是需要克服的障碍。学习需要我们专心致志，一心一意，这样才能学有所获。诺贝尔奖获得者李政道教授自幼就酷爱读书学习。他整天手中拿着书，不停地看，就连去卫生间都会带着书。有时候忘带手纸，却从来没有忘记带着书。在抗日战争期间，他到西南联大读书。不久，他的大哥回上海读书，二哥去了广西大学，只有李政道一个人仍然留在昆明坚持学业。有几次，他到广西去看二哥，每次总会丢几件行李，可是他的书就从来没有丢过。有一次，他给二哥打去求救电话，请二哥快去接他。原来他在旅途中把行李都丢了，又饿又累。等到他二哥赶到火车站一看，却发现弟弟正在候车室里全神贯注地读书。就是这种好学的精神，使得李政道在学业上取得了非凡成就。</p>
<p>读书学习需要认真，如果一心吟诗作对，追求风雅韵事，那么也不能取得大的成就。清朝人写的小说《儿女英雄传》中，有一段议论很精辟。安公子娶了张金凤与何玉凤两位美妻，少年得意，难免有些不务正业，开始讲究风雅韵事。何张两人商量着规劝夫婿，使他认真读书考取功名：“殊不知便是真‘风雅’，这两个字也最容易误人，误人还误得不浅！果然性情持得住风雅，也不过成个墨客骚人；倘被风雅移动了性情，竟会弄成个轻薄子弟。前贤那‘人无风趣官多贵，案有琴书家必贫’的两句话，虽是过激之谈，却也确有此理。你只看古往今来那些风雅先生们，哪一个是置身通显的？”读书如果只认风雅韵事，那么对于功名事业势必是不利的。对于古人而言，读书并考取功名是他们求取发展的主要途径。现代社会有了很大变化，一个人假如喜欢琴棋书画、诵读诗书，把这种爱好发扬光大，也能成为一种有前途的事业。只是需要注意的是，无论人们选择什么作为自己的学习发展目标，一旦选定以后，就需要有专心致志、全力以赴的精神与态度，只有这样才能取得成功。</p>
<p>心地干净时，可读书学古</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心地干净①，方可读书学古。不然，见一善行，窃以济私②；闻一善言，假以覆短③。是又藉寇兵④而赍盗粮⑤矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①心地干净：心无杂念，心地纯净。</p>
<p>②窃以济私：偷取来用以满足自己的私欲。</p>
<p>③假以覆短：假借善言来掩饰自己的过错。</p>
<p>④藉寇兵：藉，资助。寇，敌人。兵，兵器。</p>
<p>⑤赍盗粮：赍，付与。盗，强盗。粮，粮食。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>心无杂念、心地纯净的人才可以读圣贤书，才能学习古人的优良品德。不然的话，看到一些善良行为，就偷取来用以满足自己的私欲，听到一些好的话语就用来掩饰自己的过错，这就相当于是把武器送给敌人，把粮食送给强盗。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>心地干净没有各种杂念的人，才能阅读圣贤书，才能够学习前贤的优秀品德。不然的话，读圣贤书也不能够真正理解，更不可能学习前人的优秀品质。古人说“书中自有颜如玉，书中自有黄金屋”，意思是说书中有美女也有黄金。一个人书读得好，可以去参加科举号试，赢得功名。建立一番功业之后，金钱与美女就都有了。追求金钱与美女，不能说这种人生价值观就是不健康的。因为每一个人都有选择自己生活方式的权利，只要他没有损害到他人的利益，没有触犯法律道德，那么选择什么样的人生追求是每一个人的自由，别人无权干涉，也无权对别人的生活方式指手画脚。但是如果读书只是为了追求金钱与美女，那么对于书中记载的各种真知卓见也就不能真正理解与领悟。如果读书只是为了获取功名利禄，只是把读书作为满足自己私欲的一种手段，那么也就不能通过读书领悟古时圣贤的伟大与崇高的可贵精神。</p>
<p>中国历史上有许多奸臣，他们书读得很好，文化水平很高。宋朝时候的秦桧，就是这样。他书读得很多，文化水平很高，处理事情也很有才干。我们现在使用的宋体字就是由秦桧发明的，他在书法上很有造诣。虽然文化水平很高，秦桧在中国历史上却留下千古骂名。他投降金朝，以莫须有的罪名杀害了民族英雄岳飞父子，把握朝政谋取私利。宋体字虽然是由他发明的，后人却痛恨他的为人，并不以他的姓命名而是以宋命名他发明的新字体。后人厌恶他的为人，以致于很长时间以来人们取名时都不用“桧”字。秦桧这样的奸臣，学问高只能使他做坏事时更加得心应手而已。</p>
<p>孔子讲学图</p>
<p>由此可见，读圣贤书，学习前贤的优秀品德，需要学习者心地干净。如果一个人品质不良，掌握丰富的知识只能使他做坏事时更加方便，丰富的学识反而成为他做坏事的帮手。学习者需要端正心态，心无杂念邪思，这样才能真正学习前人的优良品德，真正掌握领会真理。</p>
<p>学须扫外物，直觅本来真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人心有部真文章①，都被残编断简②封固了：有部真鼓吹③，都被妖歌艳舞湮没④了。学者须扫除外物，直觅本来，才有个真受用⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①真文章：真正的文章，好文章。</p>
<p>②残编断简：指古代流传下来的残缺不全的书籍。简，古代用来写字的竹板。</p>
<p>③鼓吹：古时用鼓等演奏乐曲，这里用鼓吹代指音乐。</p>
<p>④湮没：埋没。</p>
<p>⑤真受用，实在的好处。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人们心中原本有一部好文章，却都被残编断简给封闭了；人们心中原本有真正动听的乐曲，却被一些妖艳的歌舞给埋没了。所以求取知识的人需要清除外来诱惑，直接寻觅原来的本性，才能获取真实的好处。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古人说“尽信书，则不如无书”，读书时不能盲目迷信书中内容。如果一切都从书本知识出发，那么必然会陷入僵化的困境中。随着历史的发展，人类积累的文化知识会越来越丰富。文化知识的载体书籍也必然会越来越多。在这样的形势下，需要我们学会利用各类书籍，使其为我所用，而不是被各类书籍束缚住。既要读书学习，也要学会独立思考，要相信自己的判断能力，相信自己心中原本有一部好文章。在书山文海中迷失方向，那么还不如舍弃这些封闭人心，扼杀人智慧的“残编断简”。</p>
<p>人心中本来有美妙的音乐，如果不能发现自己内心，被各种杂念欲望遮挡，那么本真也就被埋没了。求学问道需要扫除杂念干扰，需要寻求本性，这样才能真正有所收获。在现代信息社会中，知识更新非常快，各种新知识层出不穷。在这种情况下，如果不能明白自己真正想要追求什么，不能为自己设立学习目标，并把这个学习目标坚持不懈地持续下去，那么就很有可能迷失方向。</p>
<p>没有长期总体规划，见猎心喜，什么都想学一点，对什么都有一点兴趣，结果就是什么都学不好，什么都学不专、学不精。有一个学生，他跟着一位有名的学者学习。这个学生很苦恼，因为他对什么都有点兴趣，不知道自己到底应该学习什么。他为自己设立了一个庞大的学习目标，并且向他的老师咨询。他的老师告诉他，一个人的时间与精力有限，不可能完成那么多目标。这个学生没有听从老师的劝告。十几年过去之后，一个偶然的机会学者遇到自己当初的学生，这个当年天赋很高的学生如今变得碌碌无为。原因就是他什么都想做好，结果什么都没有做好。因此学习要想取得进步，必须有一个可以实现的学习目标，坚持不懈地实现这个目标。在学习过程中，可能会有各种杂念欲望，以及各种各样的诱惑，这些诱惑也可能是新知识、新的研究领域发出的，这个时候需要我们坚守原则，坚持最初的目标不动摇。这样做，才能在学业上有所收获。</p>
<p>兢业之心思，潇洒之趣味</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>学者有段兢业①的心思，又要有段潇洒②的趣味。若一味敛束③清苦，是有秋杀无春生，何以发育万物？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①兢业：兢兢业业，小心谨慎。</p>
<p>②潇洒：洒脱不羁。</p>
<p>③敛束：收敛约束。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>求学的人既要有谨慎小心的态度、刻苦研究的精神，又要有潇洒不俗的兴趣爱好。如果只知道约束自己、刻苦求学，使自己过着极其清苦的生活，那么生活就像只有秋天的清冷却没有春天的生机，这样怎么能培育万物呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在学习过程中，刻苦努力是必要的，同时也需要懂得自我调剂，培养一些健康的兴趣爱好来放松身心。对于求学的人来说，必须有兢兢业业、不怕吃苦、小心谨慎的学习态度。认真细致是做学问必须具有的素质，粗心大意是学习的大忌。曾经发生过这样的事情，一个小数点的错误造成一场大的事故发生。一个数据的失误，导致所有的研究都要重新做起。严谨的治学态度，认真的求学精神，都是取得成功必须具备的基本素质。</p>
<p>在刻苦学习研究的同时，学者也需要适当放松。如果只知道刻苦用功，那么生活就过于清苦了，这对于学者的创造力的发挥也是不利的。现代社会中，只知道读书，不会做事情，就会变成一个书呆子，不能够适应现代社会的发展。古往今来许多有成就的学者，他们并不是只懂得钻研学问，在一定程度上他们是很会生活的人。</p>
<p>我国宋朝时著名女词人李清照，是婉约派的代表人物之一，在中国文学史上占有重要地位，留下了许多脍炙人口的优美诗词。她嫁给了才子赵明诚，这对夫妻在做学问之余，很会享受生活。李清照从小就有很多兴趣爱好，她喜欢读书写字，也喜欢吟诗作画，还非常喜欢大自然。当时赵明诚很喜欢逛书市，每当工作之余，他就去逛书市。他挑选自己喜欢的书画以及各种古玩买下，然后再买一些新鲜水果、风味小吃，把这些东西带回家。赵明诚与李清照一面欣赏书画、品读诗书，一面品尝着水果小吃，有时候两个人还准备一些酒菜小酌，过着神仙眷侣一般的生活。现代社会中的许多学者，在刻苦做学问的同时，也有各种各样的情趣爱好。有的爱好厨艺，有的喜欢养猫，还有的喜欢书画，也有的喜欢侍弄花草。人都是生活在社会当中的，学习也不能脱离人与人之间的交流，有适当的情趣爱好也可以增进人们之间的交流沟通。</p>
<p>磨炼成福久，参勘成知真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>一苦一乐相磨炼，炼极而成福者，其福始久；一疑一信相参勘①，勘②极而成知者，其知③始真。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①参勘：对比参照着考察。</p>
<p>②勘：勘察，考察。</p>
<p>③知：知识学问。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在苦难与快乐中磨炼，通过长久的磨炼得来的幸福才能长久；怀疑与相信相互参照着考察问题，通过反复考察得来的认识才是真正的学问。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>经过苦难与快乐的反复磨炼，能够使人成长，使人增长才干，也使人明白幸福生活来之不易从而更懂得珍惜。中国历史上一些明君和良相贤臣，其中有很多都经历了苦难磨炼。从安逸生活到清苦生活，从清苦环境再到显贵环境，在这些转化过程中，他们饱尝了人世间的冷暖滋味，对人生有了更深刻的认识。这样当他们获得某些机会时，就会牢牢抓住，取得成功。汉文帝在我国历史上可称明君，“文景之治”中的文指的就是汉文帝。他在位时期，重视生产，废除严酷刑罚，经济得到稳步发展，国家呈现出繁荣昌盛的景象。汉文帝重视民间疾苦，体恤民情，这与他个人的经历有关系。在他继承皇位之前，他一直在战战兢兢的状态中过生活。当时汉高祖刘邦去世之后，政权被吕太后掌握。吕氏一门掌权，汉文帝只有谨慎小心，绝不能出一点差错才能保住性命。因为他自己经历一番磨难，所以在当上皇帝之后，能够体会民间疾苦，关心百姓生活。他关心生产，亲自率领大臣耕作。提倡节俭，以身作则，自己不穿华丽的衣服。他曾想造一座露台，结果听工匠说要花费百金之多，就嫌太贵，放弃了建造露台的打算。</p>
<p>在做学问的过程中，学者需要有不厌其烦的精神，反反复复、细致入微地考察研究问题，这样才能真正解决问题。既要相信自己掌握的知识是正确的，同时也不放弃怀疑。在怀疑与信任中反复研究考察事物，经过反复勘察得出的结论才靠得住。真理是经得住推敲的，不能经受人们反复推敲的那些认识不是真理。真理不怕人们反复考察，真理经得住人们反复研究。人们在反复考察，不断提出疑问又解决疑问的过程中，能够对事物产生新的认识与发现。反复研究考察，这样的工作虽然很琐碎枯燥，但是坚持下来最后的收获也是丰厚的。刻苦做学问虽然很苦，最后的收获有可能是甜美的果实。</p>
<p>不昧坐中堂，化贼为家人</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>耳目见闻为外贼①，情欲意识为内贼②，只是主人公惺惺不昧③，独坐中堂④，贼便化为家人矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①外贼：来自于外部的祸害。</p>
<p>②内贼：来自于内部的祸害。</p>
<p>③惺惺不昧：保持清醒不糊涂。</p>
<p>④中堂：正室。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>耳朵眼睛看到与听到的是来自于外部的祸害；感情欲望以及意识等是来自于内部的祸害。只要主人自己能保持清醒，遵守原则、坚持信念，那么无论是来自外部的祸害还是来自内部的祸害都不再是祸害，反而都会变成主人的帮手了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人们通过自己的眼睛耳朵等感觉器官去认识世界，通过感觉器官得到对世界的感性认识，再由人脑进行加工整理，最终形成理性认识。人们虽然依赖自己的感觉器官，因为没有这些感觉器官，人们无法对世界形成认识。但是人们的眼睛耳朵等感觉器官并不是一直都可靠的，有时候我们的感觉器官会欺骗我们，这个时候我们就无法对事物形成正确的认识。所以要想得到可靠正确的认识，就不能只依赖于自己的感觉器官，要保持清醒的头脑，多思考多观察。在自己心中，还要有一定的原则与信念，坚持正确的原则信念，多方考察，才能形成正确的认识。在学习中，要学会善于观察，勤于观察，就像学校老师们常说的要善于动脑。带着问题去观察认识事物，在此基础上得到的对事物的认识能够更深刻。</p>
<p>人们已有的感情欲望以及对于世界的认识等，对于人们再认识事物、了解世界，在一定程度上会产生非常重要的影响。一棵树，在不同的人看来有不同的观察角度，能得出不同的结论。商人看着这棵树，可能更多的是考虑这棵树有什么样的经济价值；植物学家看这棵树，可能更多的是关注这棵树在植物学中如何把它归类；画家看着这棵树，可能更多的是从美学的角度去观察这棵树美不美、美在哪里等。就像一个寓言故事《小马过河》中说的那样，一条河到底是深还是浅，在不同的人看来，有不同的认识。从个体小的动物来看，河水太深；而在个体大的动物来看，这条河水根本就不深。要想得到对于事物的正确认识，在实践中就需要我们不被已有的知识与经验束缚住，形成对于事物的正确认识。坚持正确的原则，坚信正确认识来源于实践，排除已有经验认识的干扰，这样有助于形成对于世界的正确认识。如果不能坚持正确的认识原则与信念，不能保持清醒的头脑，就会受到自己感觉器官的欺骗，受到自己的欲望以及已有经验认识的束缚。相反如果能坚持正确的认识原则与信念，保持清醒的头脑，那么我们的感觉器官以及已有的经验认识就会为我们所有，为我们正确认识世界而服务。</p>
<p>磨砺如炼金，施为勿轻发</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>磨砺当如百炼之金，急就者非邃养①；施为②宜似千钧③之弩④，轻发者无宏功⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①邃养：深厚的修养。邃，深邃。</p>
<p>②施为：进行某种行动。</p>
<p>③钧：古代重量单位，三十斤是一钧。</p>
<p>④弩：一种用机械力量射箭的弓，泛指弓。</p>
<p>⑤宏功：宏大的功业。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>磨炼自己的身心就要像炼钢一样反复锤炼，希望一下子就成功的人不会有深厚的修养：做某件事情应当像拉开非常重的大弓一样，轻易发射的人不会有大收获。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古人讲“十年磨一剑”，要想做成某事，取得一定成就，需要我们不断锤炼自己。耐得住寂寞，受得了挫折，长时间坚持不懈地做一件事情，最终取得的同报也是丰厚的。想一蹴而就，急功近利者不能取得大的成就。厚积薄发，才能取得大成功。曹雪芹一生只留下一本《红楼梦》，这本书却成为文学巨著，在文学界大放光彩。李时珍花儿十年的时间，走遍大江南北，编写出《本草纲目》，时至今日这本医药宝典依然具有重要研究价值。马克思花几十年的时间写作《资本论》，康德花了大量时间与精力研究他的批评理论。付出的越多，取得丰富回报的可能性也就越大。付出少，却想取得丰厚回报，这是一种不切实际的想法。</p>
<p>诺贝尔奖是当今世界上非常有影响的大奖，许多时候人们以某一个国家中取得诺贝尔奖人数的多少来衡量这个国家的科学文化发展水平。设置这一大奖的人诺贝尔是一位瑞典人，他学习掌握了英、法、德等国语言，继承父亲的事业研究炸药。在研制炸药的过程中，诺贝尔遇到数不清的困难，遭受过无数次失败。在一次实验中，实验室被炸飞，诺贝尔的弟弟被炸死，诺贝尔的父亲被炸伤。政府为了他人安全，禁止他们在陆地上进行实验，诺贝尔不得不把实验搬到一条船上进行。经过几年废寝忘食的努力，他终于获得成功，研究发明了安全炸药以及无烟炸药、烈性炸药。诺贝尔全身心地投入到科学研究中，一辈子都没有娶妻，一生都献给了科学研究事业。</p>
<p>在学习过程中，需要人们坚持不懈地努力。学习本身是不断积累的过程，有时候人们难免会感觉枯燥乏味，因而想要放弃。不断地努力，却不能很快有所收获，不能很快地取得成就，这对于人们的耐力是一种考验。经得住考验的人，最终有可能取得辉煌成就；经不起考验的人难以取得大成就。</p>
<p>天机清澈者，触物皆会心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鸟语虫声，总是传心之诀；花英①草色，无非见道②之文。学者要天机③清澈，胸次玲珑④，触物皆有会心处。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①花英：花朵。</p>
<p>②见道：领悟真理。</p>
<p>③天机：本指上天的机密，此处指人的悟性。</p>
<p>④玲珑：精巧细微，灵活敏捷。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>鸟语虫声，都是它们之间表达感情、进行交流的方式；美丽的花朵和青翠的草儿，其中都蕴藏着大自然的奥妙。研究学问的人要有清明的领悟能力，心胸灵活敏捷，和事物接触的时候都会有所领悟。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>世界上万事万物中都蕴藏着一定的道理，善于观察万物的人能从中体会出许多道理。用心体会，那么一枝一叶、一鸟一虫中都有无穷道理。正所谓一花一世界，一叶一如来，青青翠竹尽是法身，郁郁黄花无非般若。善于观察的人，能从观察事物中领悟道理。唐代画家韩干善于画马，他曾经跟着当时非常有名的画家学习，画风却与老师截然不同，韩干笔下的马更加生动传神。唐明皇问他原因，韩干说他还有别的老师，这个老师就是马厩中的活马。韩干非常重视写生，他常去观察马的生活习性，因而他画笔下的马十分传神精妙。唐代有名书法家张旭，善于将自己的情绪在书法中抒发出来。他喜欢观察，世态人情、花草树木、虫鱼鸟兽、日月星辰、风云雷电、山川溪流无不在他的观察之中。他把这种观察所得，都体现在笔下，因而他的书法格外生动、变化万端。</p>
<p>齐白石是我国有名的画家，他成名之前走过一段曲折艰难的路程。小时候，齐白石就喜欢绘画、他善于观察身边的景物，花草树木、鱼鸟小虫，他都能画得非常生动传神。由于家境贫寒，他不能完成学业。他在放牛的时候，一有空闲时间就去河边观察水中虾。他把观察所得，都在画笔下体现出来。后来齐白石成了一个木匠，他也没忘记画虾，有机会就去野外小溪边、河流边观察虾，有时候还省出钱来买一些虾，不是为了吃虾，而是把它们养起来观察。齐白石的画来自于生活，生动有趣，画中花鸟虫虾栩栩如生。</p>
<p>马</p>
<p>善于学习的人，能从世间万物中领悟真理。牛顿发现万有引力定律的故事，也体现了善于观察才能发现真理的道理。据说从剑桥毕业的牛顿回到家中，有一天在苹果树下看书。看书看累了的牛顿放下书，这时候正好有一个苹果落在他的脚下。看着这个落地的苹果，牛顿思考为什么苹果会往下落。他想象着苹果是受到地球的吸引力，因而落到地上。在想象的基础上，他最终证明了万有引力定律。</p>
<p>以迹用不足，以神用为妙</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人解读有字书，不解读无字书；知弹有弦琴，不知弹无弦琴①。以迹用②，不以神用③，何以得琴书佳趣？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①无弦琴：没有琴弦的琴，此处指宇宙间一切声音。</p>
<p>②迹用：运用形体。</p>
<p>③神用：领悟精神。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人们知道读有字的书，却不知道读没有字的传；人们知道弹奏有琴弦的琴，却不知道弹奏没有琴弦的琴。只知道运用事物的形体，却不知道领悟事物中蕴藏的道理，这样怎么能领会到琴书的真正妙处呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在学习中，人们不仅要学会阅读有文字的书，也要学会阅渎没有文字的书；不仅要能弹有琴弦的琴，还要学会演奏没有琴弦的琴。这本没有文字的大书，内容极其丰富，包括世界万事万物。这本无字书是人们自己，是人类社会，是大自然。这张无弦琴，能弹出世间万物的一切声响。不拘泥于事物的形体，能够透过事物领悟其蕴涵的道理，这样比只看得到事物的形体却不能领悟其神韵要高明得多。</p>
<p>世界上各种规律、法则，各种真理，都是看不到也摸不着的。它们没有实在的形体。人们学习认识这些规律、法则以及各种真理，需要通过自己的思考来完成。世界上的规律、法则，都是蕴涵在世界万事万物中的。人们通过对世界万事万物的观察研究，最终发现真理。古往今来，许多科学家都是通过对各种事物细致入微的观察研究，最终有所发现。有许多学者不仅研究文化典籍，还常常通过关注世界万事万物来认识世界、研究问题。</p>
<p>学习不仅需要我们学会阅读，掌握已有知识，更需要我们学会独立思考。能够独立思考，善于观察事物，能主动发现问题的人，在学业上有可能有丰硕的收获。如果只知道阅读，只懂得掌握别人的研究发现，自己不能够发现问题、提出问题，那么恐怕不能登上某个专业领域的顶峰。</p>
<p>美国人比尔·盖茨如今在世界范围内都非常有名，他创造了巨大的财富。当年盖茨在学校读书的时候，曾经和一个男生很谈得来。他们都对电脑很感兴趣，见面时两个人常谈论一些关于电脑方面的问题。后来这个男生发现盖茨经常不来上学，有一次再遇到盖茨，他就问盖茨怎么好长时间不见他来上学。盖茨说自己要退学创业，他问这个男生愿不愿意与自己一同创业。这个男生表示不愿意，他还想多读书，有许多问题他还没有获得解答。后来比尔·盖茨创业成功，连续多年居于世界首富的地位。可见在求学的路上，学会独立思考，能够自己发现问题并解决问题非常重要。</p>
<p>涉世中出世，尽心内了心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>出世①之道即在涉世②中，不必绝人以逃世；了心③之功即在尽心④内，不必绝欲以灰心。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①出世：超脱世俗。</p>
<p>②涉世：接触社会。</p>
<p>③了心：明白心的道理。了，明白、懂得。</p>
<p>④尽心：用心。以智慧扩张善良本心。《孟子·尽心章上》：“尽其心者知其性也。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>超脱俗世的方法就在人世间的磨砺中，没有必要离群索居躲避人世；明白自己内心本性的功夫就在努力用心之中，没有必要断绝一切欲望使心如死灰一般枯寂。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>现代社会中，社会发展的脚步越来越快。人与人之间，国家与国家之间，各种信息流动的速度非常快。尤其是互联网的发展，使得世界各地都能在很短的时间内取得联系。在这样的现实背景之下，想离群索居，过着与世隔绝的隐士生活，不那么容易实现。无论人们对现实社会的态度如何，人都是社会性的动物，不能离开社会存在。有一部小说《鲁宾逊漂流记》，说的是鲁宾逊乘坐的船触礁，船上其他人都遇难，只有他一个人活下来。鲁宾逊在荒无一人的小岛上独自生活，最初经历了很多困难，但是他终于克服困难活下来了。后来他又救了一个人，两个人在岛上生活，最后遇到一条船经过这里，他们搭上这艘船返回了人类社会。鲁宾逊最初一个人在荒岛上生活，他的谋生技能有很多还是不能脱离开文明社会，因为他从那艘触礁的船上找回来一些可以利用的工具。现代社会中，要想找一处与世隔绝、风景宜人的世外桃源，是非常困难的事情。既然不能离群索居、与世隔绝，我们就在涉世之中也能实现出世的愿望。</p>
<p>在世俗之中，也能使自己生活得不俗，使自己的品质不沾染世俗尘垢。社会是一本大书，社会是一所大学。社会这本大书，社会这所大学，要比我们在学校读的书更为精深。如果能在社会中取得好成绩，也就更为高明。了解自己的本心，努力用心就可以实现。不需要断绝一切欲念，使得自己心如枯木，这是不可取的做法。断绝一切欲望，对于人在社会之中生存也是非常不利的。人与人之间交往，共同的爱好以及一些共同的话题，是人们交往联系的重要纽带。一个人没有任何欲望，没有任何爱好，这样在和别人交往的时候，不容易与他人找到共同话题。所以学习者在涉世之中也可以做到超脱世俗，在努力用心之中就可以了解自己的内心，了解自己的本性不必断绝一切欲望，合理的欲望可以保留。</p>
<p>知成之必败，求成不必坚</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>知成之必败，则求成之心不必太坚；知生之必死，则保生之道不必过劳①。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①劳：操劳，过分地花费心思体力。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>做事情有成功也就必然会有失败，了解到这个道理，人们就没有必要凡事都一定要求成功；生命有生存也就必然会有死亡，了解到这个道理，人们就没有必要过分费心保养自己的身体。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生在世真正可以利用的时间非常有限。一个人从幼年到老年，至少有四分之一的时间是在睡觉休息，再加上花费在衣食住行以及保健卫生上的时间，剩下的时间并不是很多。幼年时还不懂事，凡事都依赖于人，根本不可能做什么事情。老年国时精力衰竭，想做事情也可能是心有余而力不足。所以每一个人的一生，能留给自己创造人生价值的时间是非常有限的。在这样的情况下，如果我们对每一件事情都特别执着，都要求成功，是不切实际的想法。做事情有成功的时候，也必然会有失败的时候，要求每一件事情都只许成功不许失败，在有些情况下只能是美好的愿望罢了。</p>
<p>人生有限，我们需要把时间与精力用在最有价值的事情上。什么事情是最有价值的，没有统一不变的标准，最有价值的事情因人而异。有的人可能认为创造大量社会财富是最有价值的事情，也有的人可能认为在科学研究上取得成就是最有价值的，也有人认为教育子女建设一个和谐美满的家庭是最有价值的。每一个人都可以依据自己的价值标准，把时间与精力用在最有价值的事情上。</p>
<p>有时候我们可能会认为，我们的时间还有很多，尤其是对于青年人来说，他们的时间似乎还有很多。实际上仔细想来，每一个人的时间都是非常有限的，因此我们无论做什么事情都要趁早。与其到最后舍不得放手，幻想世界上能有某种使人长生不老的灵丹妙药，不如在一切还来得及的时候，早做选择努力做事。才女张爱玲曾说过，“出名要趁早，来得太晚的话，快乐也不那么痛快。”当然我们每个人的追求不一样，不是每一个人都想要出名，可能对于有些人来说出名不是什么好事情。只是我们需要把握人生，了解生命有限，那就要早为自己的人生路作出选择。鱼与熊掌不可兼得，人不可能做许多事情，也不可能把许多事情都做得尽善尽美，应选择符合自己志趣的事情并把它做好。</p>
<p>未定绝尘嚣，既坚混风尘</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>把握未定①，宜绝迹尘嚣，使此心不见可欲而不乱，以澄②吾静体③；操持既坚，又当混迹风尘④，使此心见可欲而亦不乱，以养吾圆机⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①把握未定：意志不坚定，自控能力不强。</p>
<p>②澄：澄净。</p>
<p>③静体：指澄净之心的本性。</p>
<p>④风尘：风吹尘土扬起，比喻纷乱的人世。</p>
<p>⑤圆机：佛家语，因机是圆顿的机根，一念开悟即得佛果的根性。这里比喻超脱俗世，不为外物所拘束。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>意志还不坚定、自控能力不强的时候，应该远离繁华的俗世，自己看不到各种各样的诱惑就不会意乱心迷，这样才能保持澄净之心的本质；等到意志坚定能够自我控制的时候，又应该多接触纷乱的环境，使自己看到各种各样的诱惑却不会动心迷乱，这样能够培养自我超脱世俗的灵机。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>对于涉世不深的年轻人来说，需要避开各种各样的繁华场所。因为涉世不深，对于世界的了解也不深刻，意志力也不是很坚定，自我控制能力也不是很强。这时候遇到一些诱惑，意志力不坚定的人往往无法抵挡。所以对于年轻人来说，远离蕴藏着各种各样诱惑的繁华场所是非常必要的。现在社会中的一些社会问题，就是关于青少年的。有一些青少年，涉足各种各样的娱乐场所；还有一些，喜欢追捧名牌商品；也有一些青少年，沉溺于网络之中。无论是去各种娱乐场所，还是追捧名牌产品，都是不利于青少年学习成长的行为。沉溺于网络之中，对于青少年的身心损害更加严重。许多家长为此束手无策，学校对于这个问题也在苦苦思索好的解决办法。</p>
<p>对于成年人来说，相比较而言世界观、人生观、价值观都已将成熟，对于社会中很多诱惑有自己的鉴别能力，对于诱惑的抵抗能力也比较强。但是对于涉世不深的青少年来说，世界观、人生观、价值观都还在培养形成之中，对于社会当中的很多诱惑，没有鉴别能力或者是鉴别不清楚。在这种情况下，青少年往往很容易沉溺在诱惑之中不能自拔。心思散乱，也就无法专心于学业。所以很多地方都规定，在学校附近不能开设网吧，各种娱乐场所也不能在离学校非常近的地方开设。还有一些学校建在远离繁华市区的郊区，使得学生们远离各种繁华热闹。眼不见则心不乱，看不到那些热闹繁华，也就能够收拾身心，专心于学习求知。</p>
<p>当一个人形成健全的世界观、人生观、价值观，对于世界有了比较深刻的认识，能够坚守良好的德行的时候，就可以到繁华热闹的地方磨砺自己的意志。看到繁华热闹，心中却不迷乱。遇到各种诱惑，能够抵制诱惑，坚守自己的良好德行。经过这样的磨砺，能够使自己的意志力更加坚强，使得自己控制自己的身心，该学习就学习，该放松时候就适当放松。</p>
<p>学道须努力，得道任天机</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>绳锯木断，水滴石穿，学道者须要努力；水到渠成，瓜熟蒂落，得道者一任天机①。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①一任天机：顺其自然。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>坚持不懈、长时间努力，那么绳子也能像锯子一样把木头锯断，水滴也能穿透石头，因此做学问的人需要不断努力才能有所收获；流水汇集到一起自然形成一条水渠，瓜成熟之后瓜蒂自然脱落，因此修行悟道的人一切顺其自然才能修成正果。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>勤学苦练，才能学有所获。中外历史上有许多刻苦学习，终于有所成就的事例。元朝初年有一位叫陶宗仪的人，避难隐居华亭，每天靠种地养活自己。他每次下地干活时，都要带上笔墨纸砚，并且在树底下放一个大坛子。在辛苦耕作的同时，陶宗仪不忘思考问题。每当有了心得体会，或者是发现了一些问题的时候，他就拿起笔墨纸砚，把自己的零星想法都记载下来，然后把这纸片放到大坛子中。这样长时间坚持下来，大坛子被装满，他就再换一个新坛子，继续记录自己的思想心得。后来陶宗仪把坛子中的纸片都取出来，编辑整理成书，并且取名为《南村辍耕录》。这本书有重要学术价值，是人们研究南宋末年元朝初年时期历史的重要资料。</p>
<p>卡莱尔是英国著名历史学家，他通过多年努力工作，终于写完一本历史巨著《法国大革命史》。卡莱尔把书稿送给他的朋友阅读，请他的朋友提意见。为了写这本书，卡莱尔花费了大量时间与精力，可以说是呕心沥血才完成这本书的写作。他有一个习惯，不喜欢保留资料，每写完一部分，就把相应部分的资料都扔掉了。卡莱尔等着他的朋友给他提建议，结果过了几天之后，他的朋友满面愧疚，失魂落魄地跑来了。朋友带来了一个非常可怕的消息，书稿被烧掉了。原来卡莱尔朋友的佣人把书稿当成是废纸给烧掉了。朋友为自己的疏忽感到万分愧疚，却无法弥补这个过错。刚开始听到这个不幸的消息，卡莱尔感到很绝望，他多年的心血算是白费了。绝望过后，卡莱尔重新振作起来，又重新开始写《法国大革命史》。卡莱尔对自己说，那些被烧掉的书稿就当是写得不够好，需要自己认真修改写得更好。通过不懈的努力，卡莱尔终于写成了新的《法国大革命史》。学习就是需要人们不断地努力，勤奋学习、刻苦钻研，这样才能有所收获。修行悟道的人需要不断努力，还要保持平常心，一切顺其自然。</p>
<p>沧浪濯足图</p>
<p>火炼陶铸纯，他日成令器</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>赤子①者，大人之胚胎②；秀才者，宰相之基础。此时若火力不到，陶铸不纯，他日涉世立朝，终难成个令器③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①赤子：刚生的小孩。</p>
<p>②胚胎：生命开端。</p>
<p>③令器：优秀的人才。今，美好。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>刚出生的小孩，是成人的生命开端；考中秀才是以后当宰相的基础。假如在这个时候不努力用功，磨炼得不够，那就会像烧制陶器时由于火力不够而烧制不成上等陶器一样，将来有一天走向社会，始终难以成为一个优秀的人才。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>中国古代时就很重视幼儿教育，有条件的家庭会为孩子请启蒙教师。社会发展到今天，教育的重要意义已经不言而喻。如今世界各国都非常重视教育，孩子是祖国的未来，未来的竞争是科技的竞争，是教育的竞争。日后想有所成就，就需要付出努力。古今中外很多有所成就的人，都是付出十分努力才有所收获。</p>
<p>写下“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”之句的是宋朝时候的范仲淹。他幼时父亲病故，家中生活困难无法支撑下去，于是母亲改嫁。范仲淹跟着母亲在后父家生活，当他懂事时了解到自己身世，就辞别母亲，出外求学。他在应天书院读书，刻苦节俭，每天煮一锅粥，等到粥凝结成块状时，就把粥分成四块，上午吃掉两块，剩下的两块下午吃。冬天读书累了的时候，就把雪水浇到脸上，使自己鼓起精神读书。他发愤苦读，坚持不懈，严格要求自己。经过将近十年的苦读，范仲淹考中进士，从此走上了仕途。范仲淹在官场中，坚持自己的原则，很有政绩。他多年的苦读，为他日后研究学问，以及在官场做官打下了坚实的知识基础。他学识渊博，是宋朝时有名的文豪。如果没有从前的发愤苦学，也就不会有他日后的成就。宋朝时另一位大文豪欧阳修也是幼年丧父，跟着母亲辛苦度日。他的母亲郑氏认识字，在经济条件非常困难的情况下，她用芦荻在沙地上写字来教欧阳修认字。虽然生活清苦，欧阳修学习的欲望却十分强烈，他看起书来废寝忘食。他曾经在别人家的旧物堆里发现一本破旧不堪的书，捡起来如获珍宝，带回家去刻苦研读。他坚持不懈地勤奋学习，后来终于成为有名的大文豪。</p>
<p>所以想要在将来有所成就，就需要坚持不懈地学习，有时间时就多读一点书。中国古人有句话说“书到用时方恨少”，在年富力强的时候多读书，多学习求知，这样就能避免这种“书到用时方恨少”的遗憾。</p>
<p>事物无定品，穷理识趣先</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>琴书诗画，达士①以之养性灵，而庸夫徒赏其迹象②；山川云物，高人以之助学识，而俗子徒玩其光华。可见事物无定品，随人识见以为高下。故读书穷理，要以识趣为先。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①达士：明智达理的人。</p>
<p>②迹象：不明显的现象，这里指表面、形式。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>琴书诗画，明智聪慧的人用来培养自己的灵性，而平庸的人只知道欣赏表面，没有领略其中蕴含的内容；山川云物等美景，有智慧的人能从中学习提高自己的学识，而凡夫俗子只知道赏玩风景而已。由此可见事物本身没有固定不变的品性，是随着人们见识的不同而有高低的区别。所以阅读书籍与研究事理，要先提高自己的志趣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>琴棋书画等雅事，有智慧的人用来培养自己的性情，培养自己的灵性。如果只知道欣赏表面，只抓住形式，也就不能体悟到真正的趣味了。山川美景，有智慧的人在赏玩的同时能从中学习到一些东西，悟出一些道理，凡夫俗子们却只知道赏玩风景而已。世界万物本身没有优劣之分，是由人来根据自己的价值选择为它们作出区分。同样的一本书，有些人读了可能受益不浅，有些人读了却如过眼云烟一般没有留下多少印象。同样一处风景，有些人只欣赏其优美雅致，有些人却能在欣赏美景的同时研究花草树木的习性，或者研究地质地貌，还有人能从观赏风景中悟出人生道理。所以事物本身没有好坏优劣之分，都是由人来定的。有智慧的人才能从寻常景物中有所发现，有所收获。</p>
<p>春秋时的齐桓公，听从了鲍叔牙的举荐，决定重用管仲。齐桓公派人到鲁国索要管仲，鲁国君臣商量如何答复。有大夫说齐桓公怕是想重用管仲，管仲才干出众，要是为齐国重用，齐国变得强大，那么我们鲁国就有危险了。于是大家商量，不如把管仲杀死，把管仲的尸体送给齐国使者。齐国使者说管仲曾经差点射死我们国君，我国国君与管仲有仇，所以想要亲手杀死他。如果我带回去的是他的尸体，我国国君是不会答应的。于是管仲被捆绑起来，装进囚车里，运往齐国。管仲害怕鲁国君臣醒悟过来追杀自己，想尽快赶到齐国去，于是想到一个好办法。管仲教役夫们唱歌。役夫们一边唱一边赶路，不知不觉中忘记了疲劳，比平时快很多，他们很快就赶到了齐国。管仲与齐桓公到一个山区征战。当他们走到一处极其险峻的山前时，管仲编了一首歌，教给手下人唱，使得他们一边干活一边唱歌来忘记疲劳鼓舞精神。在管仲这里，歌曲不仅能使他愉悦自己，还能用来鼓舞人们的精神，从而帮他顺利逃脱追捕，帮他克服险峻道路阻碍。由此可见在学习求知的过程中，先要提高自己的志向与品位。志向高远，品位不俗，这样才能对世界有深入认识与发现。</p>
<p>攻人毋太严，教人毋过高</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>攻①人之恶②毋③太严，要思其堪受；教人以善毋过高，当使其可从。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①攻：责备、指责。</p>
<p>②恶：缺点、过失。</p>
<p>③毋：不要。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>指责别人的错误时不要过于严厉，要想一想别人能不能承受；教育开导别人做善事的时候，不能要求太高，要想一想别人是不是能够做到。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子说：“过而能改，善莫大焉。”一个人犯了错误并不可怕，只要知道悔过改正错误，就不会损害自己的德行。只是改正错误也并不是非常容易的事情，有些时候明明知道某些事情做得不对，明明知道自己身上存在着某些缺点，但是改正错误却并不容易。改正错误，克服缺点，需要有坚强的意志。有些人相对来说，意志比较薄弱，在这样的情况下，就不能严厉要求他们改正错误。还有一些人意志并不薄弱，却也不能改正错误，是因为他们根本就没有认识到自己犯错误了。如果严厉指责他们的错误，不仅不利于他们改正错误，还会引起他们的反感。所以指出别人的错误，不能过于严格，要以恰当的方式使对方能够接受。</p>
<p>三国时，吴国孙权很喜欢喝酒。他常常在池边和群臣饮酒，喝得酩酊大醉。喝醉以后，让人用清水浇扫群臣。醉得东倒西歪的大臣们爬起来继续喝。孙权常指着水池说，除非你们掉下去，不然就得继续喝酒。群臣大醉，东倒西歪有些不成体统。有些大臣看不过这种做法。每当这种时候，张昭就很生气，怒冲冲地走到外面去，不想和他们一样胡闹。孙权派人把张昭请回来，说大家一起玩，张公不要生气。张昭说：从前殷纣王和群臣在酒池肉林中彻夜痛饮，大家同乐不以为是坏事。孙权听了默不作声。虽然当时撤去了酒席，可是孙权心中毕竟有些不痛快。另一位大臣顾雍的做法就和缓许多。顾雍也不喝酒，当看到孙权聚众饮酒的时候，顾雍不是一甩袖子走人，他坐在一边看着大家喝酒。他也从来不像张昭那样严词厉色地劝诫孙权，他只是坐着看。喝醉酒的人，行动举止有许多滑稽放肆的地方。顾雍看到谁举动失礼就把这些记下来，等到那人清醒以后，顾雍就会把那个人喝醉以后放肆的样子形容给他听。这样一来，大家也就有所顾忌，不敢过于放肆了。</p>
<p>逆境砺节行，顺境销膏骨</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>居逆境中，周身皆针砭药石①，砥节砺行②而不觉；处顺境中，眼前尽兵刃戈矛，销膏糜骨③而不知。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①针砭药石：针，古代用来治病的金针。砭，古代用来治病的石头针。药石，古代治病用的药物。针砭药石，泛指治病用的各种工具与药物。</p>
<p>②砥节砺行：砥砺，磨刀石。粗的叫砥，细的叫砺。砥节砺行，磨炼品行。</p>
<p>③销膏靡骨：融化脂肪，侵蚀骨头。膏，脂肪。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>处在逆境当中，身边都是磨炼人品行的良药利器，人的品行在不知不觉中被磨砺得十分纯良；处在顺境当中，眼前布满各种各样的武器，在不知不觉中侵蚀人的斗志使人走向失败的道路。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的一生，有可能会处于顺境，也有可能会遭遇挫折，处在逆境当中。无论是处在逆境中还是处在顺境中，我们都需要保持清醒。顺境中不要过于陶醉，逆境中也不要过于悲伤。如果能保持清醒，辩证地看问题，处于逆境中也是好事。逆境能锻炼人的意志，有时候在遇到问题时，人的斗志与创造力才能够被激发出来。面对各种各样的挫折难题，人们寻找解决的办法，在这个过程中对于人分析问题、解决问题的能力，以及人的意志力都是很好的锤炼。身处逆境中，能够使人看清楚问题，抛弃懒惰、散漫、浮华、虚荣、奢侈等不良习惯。当然处在逆境中，需要我们奋发自强，如果处在逆境中只知道悲伤失望或者是怨天尤人，那么就无法改变自己的环境了。处在顺境中，享受安逸、不思进取，这样会消磨掉人的志气。如果在顺境中，保持清醒的头脑，不被眼前安逸的生活迷惑，保持积极的斗志，那么顺境也能助人成功。</p>
<p>有句话说“赔了夫人又折兵”，说的是三国时候的吴国与蜀国结亲的故事。刘备取得荆州，孙权担心刘备日后成大事，对自己是一大威胁。孙权召集手下商议对策，周瑜献计说把刘备留在东吴。如果刘备留在东吴，在孙权的势力范围之内，也就不能有什么大的图谋了。孙权采纳了这个意见，决定与刘备结亲。孙权派人向刘备提亲，要把自己的妹妹孙尚香嫁给刘备。刘备最初拒绝这门亲事，他与孙权之妹年龄差距比较大。后来在听人劝说之下，同意了这门亲事。孙尚香容貌出众，才思敏捷，虽然身为女子，却爱好舞刀弄枪。她性格豪爽，志气胜过寻常男子，身边的侍女都佩刀带枪。这样一位女子，自然和刘备很谈得来。刘备辛苦了大半生，娶了新夫人之后，生活安逸快乐。孙权派人为刘备建造精美府邸，选送奇珍异宝给刘备。刘备与夫人每天美酒佳肴，游山玩水，生活过得逍遥自在。在不知不觉中，不禁消磨掉了从前的志气。后来还是在赵云等人的劝诫提醒之下，刘备才带着夫人离开安乐窝。</p>
<p>可见在顺境中，需要保持清醒，不然顺境会把人们送到逆境中去。</p>
<p>文以拙而进，道以拙而成</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>文以拙进，道以拙成，一“拙”字有无限意味。如桃源犬吠，桑间鸡鸣，何等淳庞①气象！至于寒潭②之月，古木之鸦，工巧中便觉有衰飒情形矣！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①淳庞：淳厚、朴实。</p>
<p>②寒潭：寒冷寂静的水潭。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>写文章朴实无华才能有所长进，修行悟道真诚朴实才能有所收获。一个“拙”字却包含着无穷的意味。像桃花源中狗叫，桑树林中鸡鸣，这是多么淳朴充实的景象啊！至于说寒潭中映出的月影，古树上的乌鸦，虽然精巧却同时蕴藏着衰败凄凉的气象。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>桃花源中狗叫，桑树林中鸡鸣，这些景象具有淳朴的生活气息。虽然不够雅致精巧，比不上寒潭古月、老木昏鸦那样肃杀凛冽不同凡响。只是桃源犬吠，桑间鸡鸣这样寻常景致却更令人感到生意与温暖。质朴无奇，虽然令人感觉平平淡淡，却是自有其宝贵价值。儒家与道家都讲过质朴可贵。孔子说过一个人如果缺少文采，就难免显得有些粗陋，但是一个人身上的文采过于多，朴实的本质过于少，那么就会显得虚浮不实。既要有文采，更要保持质朴的本性，把文采与质朴结合起来，这样才能成为文质彬彬的君子。所以人要多学习提高自己的文化修养，还要以良好的道德规范来要求自己。文化修养水平高，能使人变得聪明智慧而又生动有趣。良好的道德修养，能使人保持忠厚朴实的本质。</p>
<p>现代教育强调要把孩子们教育成聪明、有自尊、要强、有竞争力的人。小孩子笨拙退让，不善于竞争，不适应现代社会的竞争，就会使家长们担忧。在一个竞争社会中，柔弱没有斗志，缺少聪明机智，都会使人无法适应社会的发展。在我国古代，道家的创始人老子却认为，人们聪明过了头，刚强也过了头，这时候会惹起痛苦与纷争。如果大家都能保持忠厚朴实，甘守柔弱，不争强好胜，人们的生活也就能省去很多麻烦。从表面上看老子的观点似乎与现代社会背道而驰，实际上柔弱胜过刚强、质朴胜过机巧的观点，与现代社会并不矛盾。现代人了解这些道理，对于人们适应现代社会具有很好的帮助作用。保持质朴不是否定竞争社会，而是要避免那些无用的争斗。保持质朴也不是否定聪明智慧的重要，而是要抛弃那些小聪明与奸诈技巧。</p>

<p>横逆穷困境，锻炼身心炉</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>横逆①困穷②，是锻炼豪杰的一副炉锤③。能受其锻炼者，则身心交益④；不受其锻炼者，则身心交损。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①横逆：曲折不顺心。</p>
<p>②困穷：困苦贫穷。</p>
<p>③炉锤：比喻锤炼人的事物。</p>
<p>④交益：都受益。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>贫穷困苦曲折是磨炼英雄豪杰的工具，能接受这种锤炼，对身体与精神都有好处；不能忍受这种锤炼，那么身体和精神都会受到损害。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孟子说过：“天将降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，恶其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为，所以动心忍性增益其所不能。”也就是说，天要把重大任务降临到某个人身上，必然会先要他心中有苦恼的事情，使他的筋骨时常处在疲劳之中，使他常常挨饿，困乏他的身体，并且使他每次做事都不能顺心如意，以此来锤炼他的心志，培养他坚韧的性情，增加他的本领。所以遇到苦难挫折，处在逆境当中，不妨把这苦难挫折看成是上天将要托付给我重大的责任，所以用苦难挫折来磨砺我。一个人如果从来没有经受过挫折并不是好事。社会不是繁花似锦、满地春风的乐园，处在社会当中总会遇到这样或那样的难题。如果一个人从来没有遇到过挫折与困难，当真正面对挫折与困难时往往不知道如何应对。所以遇到困难挫折，并不是一件坏事。如果我们能经受困难挫折的磨砺，培养坚强的意志力与忍耐力，无论身处什么样的逆境都能保持积极的斗志，那么将来遇到大的难题也就容易克服。</p>
<p>古今中外成大事者，都经受过艰难困苦的锤炼。我国著名思想家鲁迅，在他求学时代家中逐渐败落，经济比较困难。曾经有一段时间，他一边学习，一边要为家中事情奔波。他的父亲得病，鲁迅时常将家里值钱一点的东西拿到当铺去换钱，换回钱来就赶到药铺为父亲抓药。他在南京水师学堂读书，生活过得十分清苦。寒冬腊月，外面是冰天雪地，他没有钱添置新衣服，穿着夹裤过冬。由于寒冷难耐他就吃辣椒御寒，辣得满头大汗，寒冷的感觉也就减轻了许多。鲁迅后来落下胃病，也是由于那时候辣椒吃得过多，导致胃受到损伤。生活虽然清苦，鲁迅的学业却很优秀，生活中的苦难锻炼了他坚强的意志，更使他对于生活有清醒的认识，他后来写出如匕首刀剑一样锋利的文章，也与他经受过生活的磨砺有很大关系。</p>
<p>宽之或自明，纵之或自化</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>有事急之不白①者，宽②之或自明，毋躁急以速其忿③；人有切④之不从者，纵之或自化⑤，毋操切以益其顽。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①白：明白。</p>
<p>②宽：缓松。</p>
<p>③忿：生气，愤怒。</p>
<p>④切：紧急，急迫。</p>
<p>⑤自化：自己醒悟明白。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>遇到事情着急之中想不明白的人，缓松下来可能自己会明白过来。不要过于急躁，过于急躁有可能会增加紧张情绪，使他更加恼怒从而越发弄不明白。有些人你越强迫指挥他，他越不顺从，如果放松不拘束他，这样有可能他自己会明白过来。不要过于逼迫他，这样只会引起他的反感从而更加固执顽劣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古人说“欲速则不达”，做事情不能过于急躁。学习更是如此。人不可能一口就吃成一个大胖子，饭是一口一口吃的，知识也是一点一点累积起来的。老子说：“合抱之木，生于毫末；九仞之台，起于累土；千里之行，始于足下。”做任何事情都不能过于急躁。想让别人明白道理，不能要求对方一下子全部接受。有时越急迫想要别人明白，别人越是想不清楚。就像课堂上老师们常说的那样，如果某一个问题实在想不明白，那么不如暂时先把它放下。过上一段时间，也许自己就能突然明白过来。有时候讲的人着急，听的人更加着急，着急之中双方的火气还有可能冒上来。所以在学习中遇到不明白的地方，如果一时之间实在想不明白，那么不如先把这个问题放下，休息一段时间，或者是先去学习别的知识。过一段时间再来想这个问题也许能突然之间豁然开朗。</p>
<p>想要别人信服，不能急躁，越是急躁越不能使对方信服，反而会引起对方的反感使得他们更为顽固。留给对方时间，给他们宽松的环境，这样人们自己也许能突然明白过来。三国时候的蜀国，诸葛亮为相。刘备去世之后，刘禅继承王位。诸葛亮受刘备所托，想要北伐统一天下。这时候，蜀国南边的南蛮来侵犯蜀国。诸葛亮带兵征南。南蛮的首领是孟获，他带领手下与诸葛亮大军交战。孟获被擒，诸葛亮问他是不是信服。孟获表示不服气，诸葛亮就把他放了。不久孟获又被诸葛亮设计擒获，孟获依然表示不服，并且说如果能把他放了，他定然能战胜蜀军。于是诸葛亮又把他放了，并且要他尽情施展本领。就这样，每次孟获被诸葛亮抓住表示不服，诸葛亮就把他放了。当孟获第七次被诸葛亮擒获时，终于表示真心信服诸葛亮，从此再不敢与蜀国为敌。诸葛亮使孟获真心信服，并没有强迫紧逼孟获，而是采用宽厚松缓的态度对待孟获，使孟获认识到自己确实敌不过诸葛亮的智谋与德才，从而真心归服。</p>
<p>节义与文章，以德性陶熔</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>节义①傲青云②，文章高《白雪》③，若不以德性陶熔之，终为血气之私，技艺之末。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①节义：节操与义气。</p>
<p>②青云：比喻高官贵人。</p>
<p>③《白雪》：古琴曲名。传为春秋时晋国师旷所作。《淮南子•览冥训》：“昔者师旷奏《白雪》之音，而神物为之下降。”此处喻指高雅的诗词。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人节操与义气傲视达官显贵，文章生动高雅胜过《白雪》名曲，如果不用崇高的道德来陶冶熔化它们，节操与文章也不过是意气用事、微不足道的雕虫小技而已。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个人节操义气傲视显贵，学问文章也做得非常好，如果没有高尚的道德，终究不能发挥其应有的价值。“玉不琢不成器”，一个人在成为人才之前，需要不断地锤炼自己。拥有清高的节操与丰富的学识，如果不用高尚的德性来要求自己，节操与学识也就会被浪费。德才兼备的人才是任何时代、任何社会都需要的。</p>
<p>对于学习求知者而言，不仅需要学好文化知识，还需要培养良好的道德品质。有一个故事说的是，有一个姓李的老师调动工作到另一个城市的中学中任教。她带班主任，班中有一个叫张超的男生学习成绩非常好，他的运动能力也非常突出，各方面都很出色。张超对老师们很有礼貌。班里选班长的时候，大家都以为张超肯定会被选为班长。但是最终结果却让同学们感觉非常意外，班主任让另一个男生当了班长。张超感觉不服气，他去找班主任问理由。张超首先表明了自己愿意为班级服务的愿望，接下来就问老师为什么不让他当班长，是不是对他有什么意见。李老师微笑着解释为什么不选张超，而是选了另一个各方面也很优秀的男生。她说张超虽然待人很有礼貌，但实际上非常傲气，看不起大部分同学，也看不起某些老师。她上课的时候发现，每当有学生回答问题时答错了，张超脸上就露出嘲讽的笑容。被选为班长的那个男生就没有看不起人的习惯，每当有同学问他问题，他总是很耐心地解答。有些老师上课时，讲的内容是张超已经掌握的，他就不耐烦听课，自己做自己的事情。班主任最后说，班长这个职位不是自己各方面都出色的学生就能担任的，还需要有为班里同学办事情的意识。听了班主任的话，张超没有再说什么。只是从那以后，班主任发现每当其他同学回答错误时，张超脸上没有了从前那种嘲讽的笑容。从这个故事中我们可以看出，学习不仅学习的是知识，还需要学习不断培养良好的道德品质。</p>
<p>道随人接引，学随事警惕</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>道①是一件公众物事②，当随人而接引③；学是一个寻常的家饭，当随事而警惕。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①道：道理，真理。</p>
<p>②公众物事：社会公众的事。</p>
<p>③接引：佛家语，指佛引渡众生到西天极乐世界去，《无量寿经》中有“以此宝手接引众生”。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>各种道理是社会公众的事情，因此应随着人去引导；学习就如人每天都要吃平常饭菜那样普遍，应随着每件事情而留心警惕。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生中各种道理，是社会大众的事情，因此需要有人指引。在与别人的交流中能够加深自己对各种道理的认识。如果能遇到一位好的老师指导，对于人生中的各种道理有时候一下子就有豁然开朗的感觉。辅佐刘邦成就帝王之业的功臣张良，在一位老人的指点下，熟读兵书。后来张良运筹帷幄之中，用其所学辅佐刘邦打下了江山。三国时候的吕蒙，经孙权的指点，开始发奋学习，后来变得学识渊博，使得鲁肃感叹：“我以为你只有武功，不料如今你学识如此渊博，再也不是从前的阿蒙了！”狄青经范仲淹指点，广泛涉猎，刻苦学习，成为文武双全的人才。</p>
<p>我国宋朝时候的周敦颐是一位学识渊博的学者，他在《爱莲说》中写下“予独爱莲之出淤泥而不染，濯清涟而不妖”的名句，并且封莲为花中君子，引起很多文化人的共鸣。他的理学造诣很深，二程即程颢、程颐拜他为师，跟着他学习，后来二程成为我国历史上非常有名的理学家。古希腊大哲学家苏格拉底与柏拉图、亚里士多德是师承的关系。苏格拉底是柏拉图的老师，柏拉图又是亚里士多德的老师。柏拉图跟着苏格拉底学习，在很多哲学问题上与老师既有一致的观点，也有不同的认识。在很多问题上，苏格拉底对他起到启发引导的作用，他自己在此基础上深入研究，对问题的认识更加深入全面。柏拉图对亚里士多德同样起到引导启发的作用。亚里士多德对于很多哲学问题，既有与柏拉图相一致的看法，也有自己不同的观点，他说：“吾爱吾师，吾更爱真理。”</p>
<p>道理需要在与人交流中掌握，一位好的老师，就好比黑夜中照明的火炬，能引导人走向光明的道路。学习就像是每天都要吃饭一样，随时随地，在每一件事情中都能有所学习。知识正是靠不断地积累获得，丰富的知识不是一下子就能取得的。在每一天的日常生活中，都能有所收获、有所学习，这样积累起来定能有所收获。</p>
<p>拂逆消怨尤，荒怠奋精神</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>事稍拂逆①，便思不如我的人，则怨尤②自消；心稍怠荒③，便思胜似我的人，则精神自奋。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①拂逆：不顺，违背。</p>
<p>②怨尤：埋怨，责怪。</p>
<p>③怠荒：懈怠，懒惰。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当做事情遇到挫折失败，就想一想那些比不上自己的人，这样怨恨不满的情绪就自然消失；精神稍微有些懈怠懒惰，就想一想那些超过自己的人，这样精神自然会振奋起来。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>无论是在生活中还是学习工作中，人们有时候都会与别人进行比较。攀比如果用在合适的地方，也能对我们的人生起到激励与慰藉的作用。无论我们是喜欢还是厌恶，与别人比较都是不可避免的。在上学的时候，老师会把学生们的成绩进行比较，家长会把自己孩子的成绩与别人家孩子的成绩进行比较。工作以后，工作成绩好坏又要与人比较。所以在我们的人生当中，对比、比照是不可避免的。比是不能回避的现象，如果我们能把比运用得当，往往能收到良好的效果。</p>
<p>在学习工作中，当我们十分努力却遭遇挫折，没有取得自己想要的成功时，这个时候一味怨天尤人，或者是自怨自艾整天想自己这么努力却没有成功，这些都是无助于我们正确对待失败的做法。如果沉溺于自责与责怪别人中，那么我们就无法再奋发图强取得成功。所以在这个时候，可以多想想那些遭遇比我们更差的人。这样一对比，就会消除自己心中的怨愤。古今中外许多有成就的人，他们的成就虽然光彩夺目，取得成就之前却付出无数艰辛，遭遇数不尽的挫折与困难。美国发明大王爱迪生的一生，遭遇无数挫折才取得辉煌成就。他执着于自己的发明事业中，一次一次的失败，他决不气馁，在失败中总结失败经验重新再战。张海迪、史铁生被严重的病痛折磨，却一直不屈不挠，积极与病痛抗争，积极创造自己的人生价值。这样一对比，我们生活中的许多挫折与困难实在不算是克服不了的阻碍。常作如此对比，能够使我们消除不必要的怨愤，多一些积极斗志。</p>
<p>在学习工作中，当我们取得一些成就的时候，可能会有所懈怠。这个时候可以多比照那些比我们优秀的人，通过对比，往往能激发我们奋发图强、积极进取的精神。俗话说“山外有山，人外有人”，这个世界上优秀的人才比比皆是，比较之下，不禁能使人产生珍惜时间、不落人后的想法。</p>
<p>执理病难医，义理障难除</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>纵欲①之病可医，而执理之病②难医；事物之障可除，而义理之障③难除。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①纵欲：放纵欲望。</p>
<p>②执理之病：过分执着于某种理论道理。</p>
<p>③义理之障：道义理论方面的障碍。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>放纵欲望的毛病可以医治，固执己见、过分地坚守执着某种理论道理的毛病却是难以治疗的；在做事情方面遇到的困难是可以克服的，可是道义理论方面的障碍却很难消除。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个人放纵欲望，这个毛病是能够被医治的。假如一个人固执己见，不肯改变自己对世界的认识，坚持认为自己坚持的理论道义是正确的，这种偏执的毛病是很难消除的。做事情遇到障碍是可以克服的，道义理论方面的障碍就不容易消除了。正如王阳明说：“去山中贼易，去心中贼难”，改变一个人固有的看法是一件非常不容易的事情。坚持真理是可取的，但是过分固执地相信自己对于世界的认识就是真理，就容易变成自以为是了。如果每个人都认为自己所有的理论是正确的，那么世界文化交流也就不可能实现了。坚持真理是值得赞扬的可贵品质。但是我们所坚持的到底是不是真理，这需要我们时常思考，时常将自己坚持的理论付诸实践检验。真理是不怕检验的，道理是愈辩愈明的。真理能经受住实践的检验，真理通过实践检验更加证明了自己的正确可靠。正确的道理经过多方考察，经过全面的考量，更能显示出自己的正确性。经过检验被证明是正确的道理，我们可以坚持，靠不住的道理，人们自然会抛弃它。</p>
<p>扁鹊是战国时候的名医，有一天他见到齐桓公。扁鹊说：“您有病，病已经潜伏在皮肉之中。现在治疗还来得及，如果不及时治疗这病就会深入身体内，变得更加严重。”齐桓公不相信扁鹊说的话。他认为做医生的都喜欢说别人有病，好从中谋取利益。过几天，扁鹊又来劝齐桓公治病，齐桓公还是很不高兴地说自己根本没病。最后一次，扁鹊看到齐桓公转身就走，不再劝说齐桓公治病了。齐桓公派人问扁鹊为什么转身就走，扁鹊回答说：“从前你们国君的病，我能治好。现在他的病已经无法医治，我没有办法帮他治疗了，所以离开。”扁鹊走后，过了几天，齐桓公果然生病，不久就病死了。齐桓公的偏执，使他丧失了治疗的大好时机，最终丢了性命。由此可见，我们不可以过分固执，既要坚持真理，也要听取别人的正确意见。</p>
<p>读不落筌蹄，观不泥迹象</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>善读书者，要读到手舞足蹈①处，方不落筌蹄②；善观物者，要观到心融神洽③时，方不泥④迹象⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①手舞足蹈：形容领会到书中乐趣而感到非常得意高兴。</p>
<p>②筌蹄：陷阱，窠臼。筌，捕鱼的竹器。蹄，捉兔子的器具。据《庄子•外物》篇：“筌所以在鱼，得鱼而忘筌，蹄所以在兔，得兔而忘蹄。”</p>
<p>③心融神洽：指人沉浸在观察物体中，精神与物体融为一体，达到忘我的境界。</p>
<p>④泥：拘泥。</p>
<p>⑤迹象：不明显的现象，这里指表面、形式。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>会读书的人，要读到手舞足蹈真正从书中得到乐趣，这样才能避免流于表面、没有真正抓住书中精髓；善于观察事物的人，要能够全神贯注、集中精神，达到与事物融为一体的境界，这样才不会拘泥于事物的表面形式。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>善于相马的伯乐，把自己的相马经验记载下来，写成了一本《相马经》。他的儿子拿着这本书，非常高兴，以为自己也可以成为善于相马的人了。有一天，他出去寻找好马，经过一番寻找，带回来一只蛤蟆。伯乐看着他带回来的宝贝，简直是哭笑不得。伯乐问儿子是怎么相马的，怎么能把蛤蟆相成是良马。他回答说：“您的《相马经》上不是写着良马的重要特征是‘隆柔蛞口，蹄如累鞠’吗？”伯乐的儿子读书只看到书中文字的表面意思，没有真正领会书中要表达的意思，所以闹出把蛤蟆相成良马的笑话。因此我们在读书学习时，需要真正领会书中所要表达的意思，领悟书中精髓所在。真正懂得读书学习的人，能从书中看到许多妙处，以至手舞足蹈表达自己的高兴之情。</p>
<p>善于观察事物的人，能够达到与事物融为一体，对事物的精髓所在能够达到心领神会的程度。在现实生活中，有些人可能就没有做到这一点。比如说钱财归根结底是为人服务的，我们赚钱是为了提高我们的生活质量，可是生活中有一些人就没有认识到这一点。他们对于钱财只知道聚敛，不知道使用。在《儒林外史》中有一个吝啬鬼，一辈子都过得非常小气。在他快要死去的时候，还惦记着家中点了两根灯油芯，伸出两根手指痛苦地挣扎着不能闭目。后来是他的老妻，非常了解他的为人，知道他是心疼灯油，于是熄灭一根油芯，他这才合上眼。这个吝啬鬼是钱财的奴隶，而不是钱财的主人，他没有真正领悟钱财的价值所在。所以我们观察事物，利用事物，都需要真正把握事物的精髓，这样就能使我们避免流于表面形式。</p>
<p>在学习求知的过程中，读书学习能力和良好的观察事物能力，都是我们需要具备的基本素质。善于读书，能够真正把握书中传达的意思。善于观察事物，能够从观察事物中真正有所收获。做到这些，对于我们的学习进步具有极大的推动作用。</p>
<p>人马图</p>
<p>时时检点处，学问真消息</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>无事便思有闲杂念想否？有事便思有粗浮意气①否？得意便思有骄矜②辞色③否？失意便思有怨望情怀否？时时检点，到得从多入少，从有入无处，才是学问的真消息④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①意气：主观任性的情绪。</p>
<p>②骄矜：骄傲自负。</p>
<p>③辞色：言辞和神色，也就是指人们说的话和说话时的神态。</p>
<p>④消息：机关上控制启闭的枢纽，关键。这里可以解释为真谛。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>没有事情的时候就想一想自己有没有闲杂的思想念头。有事情的时候就要想一想自己有没有粗心浮躁意气用事。得意的时候就想一想自己有没有骄傲自负的言语表情。失意的时候就想一想自己有没有失望怨愤的情绪。这样时常检点自己的思想言行，使坏习惯渐渐从多到少，从有到无，这才是真正掌握了人生真谛。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>做事情如果有闲杂思想，不能专心致志地做事，不利于我们做好事情。有这样一个故事，说的是一个老太太去看牙医。她牙疼了好久，因为对看牙心怀恐惧所以一直没有看牙医。这一天，她终于鼓起勇气找牙医看牙。为她看牙的是一个帅气年轻的小伙子，态度非常友好。他看了老太太的牙之后，说需要根管治疗。这个时候时间已经不早了，年轻的牙医是一个摇滚音乐爱好者，他惦记着今晚他喜欢的乐队有一场演出，他非常想去看演出。因为怕错过乐队演出，这个小伙子为老太太快速治牙。老太太从牙医诊所出来后，牙齿一直不舒服，晚上的时候牙疼的那半边脸都肿起来了。年轻医生因为分心，心里想着别的事情，所以给老太太看牙时没有集中精神，导致老太太的牙没有得到很好治疗。后来老太太的牙齿虽然被治好了，但是她脸肿了好久，牙齿也疼了很久，这样一来使得本来就害怕看牙的她从此更加对看牙医心怀恐惧。由此可见，无论做什么事情，都需要专心致志，不能心浮气躁，也不能一心二用。</p>
<p>做事情不能有骄傲自负的情绪，俗话说“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，所以我们不能有骄傲自满的情绪。如果骄傲自负，容易使自己自以为是，从而失去前进的动力。一个骄傲自满的人，也容易引起别人的反感情绪，使得别人排斥自己。做事情同样也不能有失望怨愤的情绪，人们在遭遇到挫折失败的时候容易产生失望怨愤的情绪，这种情绪对于人们的进步也是不利的。失望怨愤容易使我们失去前进的动力，从而不能积极振作精神继续前进。</p>
<p>时常反省自身，想一想自己是不是有粗心浮躁的坏习惯，是不是有意气用事的时候。当自己做事情取得成绩时，是不是有骄傲自满的言行举止。当自己遭遇挫折的时候，是不是有失望怨愤的情绪。当我们把身上的坏习惯都逐渐消除后，我们在学习工作中往往能取得更大的进步。</p>
<p>勿自昧所有，勿自夸所有</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>前人云：“抛却自家无尽藏①，治门持钵②效贫儿。”又云：“暴富贫儿休说梦，谁家灶里火无烟③？”一箴④自昧⑤所有，一箴自夸所有，可为学人切戒。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①无尽藏：佛家语，“无尽藏海”的简称。《大乘义章》说：“德广难穷，名为无尽，无尽之德，包含曰藏。”用在这里，既指财富也指美德。</p>
<p>②钵：僧人所用的食具。</p>
<p>③谁家灶里火无烟：也就是说无论谁家都有一些财产。</p>
<p>④箴：劝告，劝诫。</p>
<p>⑤昧：隐藏，隐瞒。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>前人说：“扔下自己家中大量财物，却效仿沿门乞讨的穷人拿着饭碗到处要饭。”又说：“暴发户不要向别人夸耀自己的财富，哪个人家的灶下没有生火煮饭呢？”这两句箴言，一句是用来劝诫那些隐藏自己学识的人，另一句是用来劝诫那些夸耀自己学识的人。隐藏与夸耀都是做学问的人需要戒除的不良习惯。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“寸有所短，尺有所长”，每个人都有自己的长处，也有自己的短处。有些人只看到自己的短处，看不到自己的长处，觉得自己比不上别人，自己贬低自己，一味羡慕别人所拥有的，这种妄自菲薄的态度是不可取的。还有一些人只看到自己的长处，看不到自己的短处，于是容易骄傲自满，喜欢到处炫耀，这种做法也是不可取的。</p>
<p>有一个寓言故事，说的是有一只羊和一头骆驼交谈，骆驼说长得高好。羊不同意骆驼的观点，认为长得矮才好。骆驼就说我能证明个子高比个子矮好。羊听了不服气，就说我也能做一件事情证明个子矮要比个子高好。羊和骆驼来到一个花园旁边，花园四周有围墙，花园里面有些大树的树叶都伸出墙外来。骆驼很轻松地就吃到了树叶，羊使尽全身力气也吃不到树叶。骆驼说：“这下你该承认个子高比个子矮强了吧？”羊还是不肯认输。骆驼和羊继续向前走，突然看到前面围墙里有个窄小的门。羊很轻松地从小门里进去，花园里有好多青草和绿树，羊美美地饱餐一顿。骆驼使尽各种办法，也无法从小门里钻进去。羊说：“这下你该承认个人矮比个子高强了吧？”骆驼也同样地不服气。这个寓言故事说明，无论是高还是矮，都各有优势，同时也都有不足。高有高的好，矮也有矮的用处。高也有高的不好，矮也有矮的不足。所以我们在学习工作中，既需要看到自己的长处，又需要发现自己的不足之处。</p>
<p>自己隐藏自己所有，自己夸耀自己所有，这两种行为都是阻碍进步的做法。学习求知需要我们对自己有清醒认识，既能看到自己拥有的优良品质，也能发现自己在哪些方面存在不足。相信“山外有山，人外有人”，从不自我夸耀。因为喜欢炫耀是一种浅薄的行为，真正拥有丰富学识的人往往都是谦虚的人。不隐藏自己所有，也不自夸自己所有，这样能促使我们取得更大进步。</p>
<p>昨非不可留，今是不可执</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>昨日之非①不可留，留之则根烬②复萌，而尘情③终累④乎理趣⑤；今日之是不可执，执之则渣滓⑥未化，而理趣反转为欲根。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①非：错误。</p>
<p>②烬：物体燃烧后剩下的部分。</p>
<p>③尘情：凡心俗情。</p>
<p>④累：拖累，连带。</p>
<p>⑤理趣：义理志趣。</p>
<p>⑥渣滓：精选提炼后的残渣。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>昨天犯的错误不可以保留，如果保留错误就有可能会再犯同样错误。这样义理和志趣就会被世间的杂念俗情所拖累。今天正确的东西也不可以执着不放，执着不放是心中的杂念等残渣还没有被彻底清除。这样就会使义理和志趣转变为欲望的根基。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>从前犯过的错误，如果我们能吸取经验教训，从此不再犯这样的错误，我们的人生也许能取得更大成功。小罗学业优秀，毕业后她进入一家大公司做财务工作。这家公司待遇优厚，小罗对此比较满意，但是对自己的上司有些不满。因为她的上司总是让她做一些琐碎的事情，似乎对小罗的能力还不十分肯定。有一次小罗的上司要小罗录入账目表，小罗做完之后交给上司。上司要她核对一下账目有无错误，小罗核对之后发现有一笔款对不上账，反复核对还是对不上账。于是她怀疑上司交给她的帐表有错误，结果上司复核之后发现小罗在录入时少输入一个零，所以导致款对不上账。这件事情使得小罗上司对小罗非常不满意。又过了一些时候，上司要去外地出差，要小罗跟着一起去。</p>
<p>小罗在上学的时候养成作息时间没有规律的生活习惯，经常在白天睡到中午才起来，晚上几乎彻夜不眠。自从上班以后，她改掉了这种生活习惯。但是当周末同学来找她玩时，她又情不自禁玩了一个通宵，结果使得她周日睡到下午两点才起床。由于起床晚，到晚上该休息的时间，她反而睡不着觉，一直清醒到凌晨五点，她开始犯困，想着稍稍睡一小觉应该不会耽误多少时间。这一睡却又使她错过了和上司约定见面的时间，上司等了她很久，打她手机又无人接听，只好打电话到公司另外找了一个人和自己出差。小罗上司出差回来后，就把小罗辞退了。小罗由于没有改正自己粗心的毛病，没有彻底改掉粗浮不良的生活习惯，使自己丢了工作。所以在生活中，如果我们不能及时改正缺点，一而再、再而三地犯同样的错误，将有可能给我们的生活带来很大损害。相反如果我们能够及时改正缺点，将会使我们取得更大进步。</p>
<p>错误需要及时改正，正确的东西也不必过于执着。如果对于自己哪些地方做得对，哪些习惯是良好的习惯，哪些品质是优良的品质，对于这些用心过多、念念不忘，就有可能使正确的东西向相反的方向转化。</p>
<p>百折不回心，万变不穷用</p>

<p>①士人：学者，读书人。</p>
<p>②妙用：奇妙的用处。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人们有百折不挠的真诚决心，才会有无穷无尽的才智应对变化无穷的世界。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在生活中，如果我们能有百折不挠的精神，遇到任何困难或者挫折都不会改变自己的目标，遇到任何诱惑都不会改变自己的理想，那么我们无论做什么事情最终都能有所收获。有百折不挠的精神，有坚定的信念，遇到任何困难都能克服，遇到任何诱惑都不会动心，这是在各个领域里取得杰出成就的人士共同具有的基本素质。</p>
<p>发明大王爱迪生，一生中有许多伟大发明，为世界的进步与发展作出了积极贡献，被人们称为天才，但是他自己却说：“所谓天才是百分之一的灵感，加上百分之九十九的汗水。”他为自己的发明付出了数不尽的汗水与努力。小时候爱迪生并不是一个讨老师们喜欢的学生，退学回家由自己的母亲辅导学习。那时候爱迪生家境困难，他为了攒钱进行各种实验，长到12岁时就开始卖报纸谋生。他一边在火车上卖报纸，一边研究发明，有时候也在火车上做实验。有一次实验失火，造成一节车厢跟着起火。列车长非常生气，把爱迪生所有的实验设备都扔掉了，还打了爱迪生一顿。爱迪生为了发明一种适合于家用的经济安全的柔光灯，花费了很大力气去寻找适合的材料。他试验过几千种材料，就像大海捞针一般，一个一个地试验，最后终于找到一种合适的材料做灯丝。爱迪生经常如此，为了寻找一个合适的材料，有时他会在世界各地耐心地寻找，坚持不懈地进行研究测试。有人问他，在发明电灯泡的上万次失败中他是怎么样坚持下去的，他回答说自己从未失败过，因为他在实验过程中证明了上万种方法是无效的。当他的实验室在一次大火中被烧毁的时候，他很乐观地说我们又可以重新开始了。当他80多岁的时候，那时候他早已经功成名就，可是他仍然在坚持不懈地进行研究发明。正是这样不断努力，使得爱迪生成为一位非常伟大的发明家。</p>
<p>操存涵养功，处一化齐妙</p>

<p>注释</p>
<p>①动静：运动和静止。</p>

<p>⑩妙：美好。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>学者如果在行动和静止的时候有不同的节操表现，在喧闹与寂静的时候有不同的志趣，这还是由于没有锻炼成熟、心思容易混杂所造成的。学者需要操持心志、修养身心，在静止不动的云与水中看到鸢飞在天、鱼跃水底的景致，在狂风骤雨中看到风平浪静的风光，这样才能看到万物齐一的美妙。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>齐桓公和管仲商量攻打卫国的事情。等到齐桓公回到后宫，一个从卫国嫁过来的妃子看到他，就向齐桓公拜了又拜。齐桓公问她为什么要这样多礼，妃子回答说是替卫国国君请罪。齐桓公奇怪地问她为什么要替卫国国君请罪。妃子回答说：“我看到大王趾高气昂地走进来，像是准备去讨伐征战。看到我，大王的脸色变了，这说明大王要攻打的是卫国。”第二天，齐桓公看到管仲后，先向管仲行了个礼，然后请管仲进来。管仲说：“大王放弃攻打卫国的想法了吗？”齐桓公奇怪管仲怎么会知道自己的心事。管仲说：“大王拱手行礼态度很恭敬，说话语气和缓，看见我脸上有羞愧的表情，所以我就知道了。”齐桓公与管仲筹划讨伐莒国，还没有确定如何攻打，国内已经流传开这件事。齐桓公奇怪，就问管仲原因。管仲说：“国中定是有高人。”桓公想了想说：“白天来干活的人中，有一个人手中干活，眼睛向上看，我想就是这个人吧。”于是命人把那个干活人招来问话。那人低头走进来，管仲说：“一定就是这个人。”于是齐恒公对这个人以礼相待，问他：“我没有宣布攻打莒国，你为什么擅自散布消息说我们要攻打莒国？”那个人回答说：“我听说君子有三种表情：喜乐的样子是听钟鼓音乐时候的表情，忧郁的样子是服丧的表情，斗志昂扬的样子是将要打仗的表情。大王唏嘘却没有声，说的是讨伐莒国。举起手指向远方，也是指莒国。我私下来想诸侯之中不服从大王的也只有莒国。所以我才这样说。”</p>
<p>齐桓公的表现不够沉稳，处理事情没有达到气定神闲的程度，在关系利害得失的问题上不能从容对待，所以容易被别人猜中心事。如果对待得失荣辱能够做到一视同仁，才能够看到世界万物齐一的美妙之处。</p>
<p>英敏以学摄，激昂以德融</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>才智英敏①者，宜以学问摄②其躁；气节激昂者，当以德性融③其偏。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①英敏：聪慧敏捷。</p>
<p>②摄：统摄，约束。</p>
<p>③融：消融，调和。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>聪慧敏捷的人，适宜用学问来消除他身上的浮躁之气；气节激烈高昂的人，应当用优良的品德来消融他身上偏执的缺点。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>现代社会中，人们常说现在的人变得越来越浮躁。浮躁虽然不是大毛病，却不利于学习进步。在学习中，如果人们有浮躁的缺点，那么就不利于深入研究学习，也不利于仔细认真地研究问题。因此对于浮躁，能够把它消除掉是最好的。才思敏捷的人，可以用更多学问来清除自己身上的浮躁之气。俗话说学海无涯，学问深入浩瀚的海洋，面对浩瀚的知识海洋时，人们身上的浮躁之气自然会被清洗掉。一个人学的东西越多，掌握的知识越丰富，相应地浮躁之气也会越少。</p>
<p>气节高昂的人，如果能培养优良的品德，那么看问题也就能避免偏执，固执的性格也能有所改善。宋朝时，狄青是一位有名的大将。他出身寒微，凭着自己一身本领，立下显赫战功。朝廷中有不少人对他很是钦佩。当时范仲淹一见到他，就觉得他气质不凡。范仲淹对韩琦说狄青是良将之材，需要好好培养他。范仲淹问狄青有没有读过书。狄青回道：读得不多，只略微读过几本。范仲淹又问他喜欢看什么书。狄青回答说凡是书都喜欢看，不过没有人教我选择看什么书。范仲淹就推荐狄青多读史书，并且说成为一员大将，却不知道古今历史，那只能是匹夫之勇。范仲淹取出自己随身携带的《左氏春秋》送给狄青，告诉他回去读，有什么不懂的地方可以来问。从此狄青更喜欢读书，有什么不懂的地方就虚心向人请教。他对于秦汉以来将帅如何用兵打仗，了解得十分详细，自己从中借鉴用兵之道，收获不浅。他举止言语之间以及身上的气质与从前相比，有很大变化，不再像从前只是雄纠纠气昂昂的武夫样子。从此狄青的声名更加显赫。</p>

<p>初起剪人欲，乍明拓天理</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人欲从初起处剪除，便似新刍①剧②斩，其功夫极易；天理③自乍④月时充拓⑤，便如尘镜复磨，其光彩更新。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①新刍：新长上来的牧草。刍，喂牲畜的草。</p>
<p>②剧：快速，立刻。</p>
<p>③天理：自然法则。宋明的理学家认为封建伦理纲常是客观存在的道德法则，称之为“天理”。</p>
<p>④乍：刚刚，起初。</p>
<p>⑤充拓：充实，拓展。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人的各种欲望，如果能在刚刚萌发的时候就消除掉，就好比小草刚长出来就被砍除一样，是非常容易的，不用费什么功夫就能做到。各种规律法则、伦理道德，如果能在刚刚明白的时候就加以扩展充实，那就好比落满灰尘的镜子经过擦拭会更加明亮一样，会收到更加良好的效果。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在现代社会中，人们经常会遇到这样或者那样的诱惑。如果人们意志力不够坚强，就容易被诱惑捕获，被自己的欲望牵制，严重时甚至会变成自己欲望的奴隶。所以我们在保留合理欲望的同时，需要战胜各种各样过分的欲望。战胜不合理的欲望，如果能在欲望刚刚产生的时候就入手清除，能收到事半功倍的效果。如果任由欲望发展壮大，最终就难以轻易消除欲望了。就好比割草一样，草刚长出来就立刻把它清除，这时候还比较容易，如果等小草长得非常茂盛的时候再去割草，就比较费劲了。学习各种道理在刚有所明白的时候，就抓住时机，加以充实拓展，也能收到事半功倍的效果。</p>
<p>小周与小王是同学也是好朋友，两个人从中学到大学都是同学。小王有一些不好的生活习惯，他喜欢吃方便面以及各种快餐食品，经常不按时吃饭，还喜欢抽烟喝酒。这些不良的生活习惯对于他的身体健康非常不利。小周没有这些不良生活习惯，但是他非常喜欢玩游戏。有时候晚上不睡觉，对着电脑玩游戏。两个人都规劝对方改掉不良习惯，后来有一天两个人决定互相监督着对方，使其戒除不良习惯。每当小周对着电脑长时间玩游戏时，小王就提醒他不要再玩。每当小王不按时吃饭，总是吃一些不利于身体健康的快餐食品，或者是抽烟喝酒的时候，小周就提醒小王要改掉这些不良的生活习惯。这样一来，两个人渐渐都改掉了不良习惯。两个人互相监督对方，使得对方在一产生想要做某事的欲望时，就被及时打消，时间一长不良欲望自然也就消除了。所以在欲望刚一产生的时候，就及时消除它，能收到很好的效果。在学习中，对某个问题有所领悟，就不要轻易放过，紧紧抓住问题深入学习研究，不断拓展知识面，也能够在学习中收到良好的效果。</p>
<p>文章只恰好，人品只本然</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>文章做到极处①，无有他奇，只是恰好；人品做到极处，无有他异，只是本然②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①极处：极高极远，登峰造极，在程度上不能再超过的界限。</p>
<p>②本然：本性。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人写文章达到登峰造极的最高水平时，并没有什么奇特的地方，只是把自己的思想意识恰到好处地表达出来而已。一个人品德修养达到完美的程度，也没有什么奇异的地方，只是保持自己纯朴优良的本性而已。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>真正的好文章，不是无病呻吟、堆砌华丽辞藻的文章。好文章既能表达真挚感情，又能传载深刻思想。好文章不会故意堆砌生涩怪癖的词句。一篇令人感动的文章，不会有多少奇异之处，恰恰是那些语言清新流畅，感情质朴真实的文章更能打动读者。文章写得恰到好处，既没有多余的废话，也没有缺乏内容、空洞无物的毛病，这样的文章才是好文章。中国历史上唐宋时期的古文运动，就是要反对文坛上堆砌华丽辞藻、没有实质思想内容的风气，恢复从前清新自然的文风。清新自然的文章正如有句诗形容的那样：“清水出芙蓉，天然去雕饰。”没有多余的修饰，却能够自然打动人，这样的文章读起来既能使人感到轻松自然，又能从中有所收获。</p>
<p>道德高尚的人，没有什么奇特怪异的地方，表现的恰恰是自己的自然本性。“清水出芙蓉，天然去雕饰”，这句诗同样可以用来形容一个人清新自然的品质。温润如玉，出自天然，不骄不躁、不卑不亢，质朴善良，这样的人品可以称之为君子的人品。所以我们在学习求知的过程中，没有必要崇拜奇特怪异的人或事物。写文章不需要刻意追求新奇怪异，保持清新自然，出自自己的真情实感，这样的文章才是好文章。做人也是如此，保持自己的自然纯朴本性，不要丢掉自己的优良本质，这样就能成为一个有德行的人了。</p>
<p>提醒昏散念，放下吃紧念</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>念头昏散①处，要知提醒；念头吃紧时，要知放下。不然，恐去昏昏之病，又来憧憧②之扰矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①昏散：不清楚、不集中。</p>
<p>②憧憧：往复不绝，形容心意摇摆不定。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当头脑感觉到昏沉、思想不集中的时候，要知道提醒自己集中精神；当感到精神过于紧张烦躁的时候，要知道放松身心。不然的话，恐怕刚治好头脑昏沉、精神散乱的毛病，又陷入被过多的思绪困扰之中。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在生活中，我们可能都会有这样的经验，当为一件事情过于紧张，以致于头脑昏沉、无法集中精神的时候，先把这件事情放下，转而去做别的事情，休息一段时间之后，最初难以解决的问题突然变得容易解决了。当我们想办好一件事情的时候，就需要收敛集中精神，全力以赴地做事情才能收到良好的效果。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是有一位学者，利用假期研究一个学术问题。他收集了大量资料，每天都把自己关在书房里研究学习。过了一段时间，他的研究遇到一个难以克服的困难，他很苦恼。为了这个难以克服的困难问题，他几乎达到了废寝忘食的程度，整天在书房里集中精神研究。他闭门谢客，从不外出。他读中学的儿子来找他，希望父亲和他一起出去走走，不要总是把自己关在房间里。学者拒绝了儿子的建议，并且说不要儿子来打扰他。他的妻子希望丈夫和自己一同逛街买东西，他同样拒绝了妻子，觉得妻子简直是捣乱。他告诉妻子，以后不要为逛街买东西这样琐碎的事情来打扰他。他的妻子和儿子发现不能改变他，也只好任由他关在书房中自己苦恼。学者废寝忘食地研究了一段时间，依然没有成果。这一天，妻子与儿子都不在家，他突然发现书房窗户前有杂草。杂草长得异常茂盛，把院子里的花都盖住了。院子里的花是学者亲手种植的，他不能忍受杂草把花的养分夺走，于是拿起工具除草。杂草清理完之后，他发现院子里还有些空地，于是又在那些空地上种植土豆、南瓜。干完活之后，他洗手进书房继续进行他的研究，突然之间发现自己从前的思路不正确。他换了一个思路看问题，从前难以解决的问题竟然迎刃而解。</p>
<p>识乃照魔珠，力乃斩魔剑</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>胜私制欲之功，有曰识不早、力不易者，有曰识得破、忍不过者。盖识是一颗照魔的明珠①，力是一把斩魔的慧剑②，两不可少也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①明珠：价值非常高的珠子。佛经《净土论注》说明珠“置之浊水，水即清净，投之浊心，念念之中罪灭心净”。</p>
<p>②慧剑：佛家语，用智慧比喻利剑，认为利剑能斩断烦恼与魔障。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>战胜私情、克服欲望的功夫，有人说是因为没有早看穿私欲的危害、意志又不够坚定，所以不能战胜私欲。也有人说虽然能看穿私欲的危害，但是没有坚强的意志力，所以不能够战胜私欲。所以一个人的智慧知识是看穿邪魔的宝珠，意志力是战胜邪魔的利剑。要想战胜私欲，智慧与意志力两者缺一不可。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在很多时候，人们并不是不知道自己很多思想行为不好，但是却无法改正自己的缺点，这就是因为要想战胜自己的各种私心杂欲，不仅需要了解其害处，更重要的是有坚强的意志力。在面对诱惑的时候，如果能有坚强的意志力，就能克服自己内心蠢蠢欲动的欲望。很多人知道吸烟不好，但是却戒不掉，最主要的就是缺乏坚强的意志力，当烟瘾上来的时候，不能够克服抽烟的冲动。生活中有很多这样的事情，很多人知道自己有许多习惯不好，却始终无法改正不良习惯。</p>
<p>小李是一个开朗活泼的青年人，本来有光明的前途。他自己学业优秀，活动能力强，交际面广，兴趣爱好都很广泛。他还有一个感情很好的女朋友。但是小李有一个非常不好的习惯，喜欢赌博。在学校的时候，他只是和人小赌，每次输赢钱数都不多。毕业之后，他去一所中学教书。学校建造在郊区，实行封闭式管理。小李在学校里无法赌博，忍耐了一个学期。等到一学期结束之后，他就找到从前一起赌博的朋友，又聚齐了几个人一起到城里赌博。这次聚赌，使得小李输掉很多钱。女朋友知道这件事情之后，非常生气，说原谅他这一次，如果他不改掉赌博的恶习，就和他分手。小李自己也很懊悔，因为这一次赌博把他所有的积蓄都输掉了，还借了朋友的钱。小李向女朋友发誓，说自己从此以后再也不会赌博。从那以后，小李果然再也没有赌博。两年之后，小李准备与女友买房结婚。他自己的积蓄加上女友的积蓄，还有和双方亲戚借的一部分钱，都由小李掌管。小李和女友去看了几处房子，女友由于还要上班就先走了。小李还在放暑假中，自己去继续看房子。这个时候，他突然碰到从前在一起赌博的朋友。两个人聊了一会，朋友问小李还想不想去玩一玩。小李犹豫了，他知道应当马上拒绝，可是却又想着似乎玩小一点不赌大的是没有关系的。朋友看他犹豫，就说我们玩小一点的。小李终于没有克制住自己，跟着朋友又去赌了。他想着玩一两把就马上离开，结果当他出来的时候，把买房子的钱都输掉了。女友铁了心要和他分手，小李懊悔不迭，他恨自己当时为什么管不住自己呢。</p>
<p>意见害心贼，聪明障道屏</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>利欲未尽害心，意见①乃害心之蟊贼②；声色③未必障道，聪明乃障道之屏藩④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①意见：意思、见解。这里指偏见或成见。</p>
<p>②蟊贼：危害人类社会的败类，这里指祸害的根源。蟊，专吃禾苗的害虫，据《诗经•小雅》篇：“及其蟊贼，传：‘食根曰蟊，食节曰贼。’”</p>
<p>③声色：歌舞女色，这里泛指一切享乐的生活。</p>
<p>④屏藩：屏风和藩篱，这里指障碍。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>名利与欲望未必都会扼杀心性，心存偏见才是伤害心性的最大害虫；声色享乐的生活未必都阻碍人们学习求知，自作聪明才是阻碍人们获取真知的最大障碍。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>名利与欲望，放纵享受的生活，对于人们学习求知会起到很大的阻碍作用。但是与偏见和自作聪明比较起来，利欲与享受对于人们的损害还比不上偏见和自作聪明对人们的损害更大。由此可见，偏见和自作聪明对于人们的进步实在是一个非常大的障碍。</p>
<p>聪明如苏东坡学士，也曾经犯过自以为是的错误。苏轼从外地回到京城，去拜访丞相王安石。当时王安石有客人，所以苏轼在王安石的书房中等候。苏轼闲极无聊，翻看书房中的书籍，突然发现书桌上有纸笔。他拿过那张纸一看，原来是一首没有写完的诗。“昨夜西风过园林，吹落黄花满地金。”苏轼心想，王安石这老儿真是老了，想当年他下笔如有神，如今一首诗还写一半留一半。再一细看这诗，苏轼又心想，王安石这老儿怎么如此不通。黄花也就是菊花，菊花是不会凋落的，只是在枝头枯死，却不会落地。这样看来王安石这首诗确实是不通的。苏轼一时之间来了兴致，提起笔来续了两句：“秋花不比春花落，说与诗人仔细吟。”苏轼写完之后，放下笔来立刻就有些后悔，心想王安石这老儿很是古怪，我续这两句，指出他的错误，怕是会被他说成是轻狂。虽然后悔，只是已经写了，无法抹去，苏轼也无可奈何。他拜见了王安石，谈了一会儿话就出来了。</p>
<p>后来苏轼又被贬到黄州。他心胸开阔，对于挫折安然处之。他在公事之余，寄情于山水。有一天他去拜访一个朋友，与朋友饮酒游玩。他们来到一个花园中，看到眼前景致，苏轼惊得目瞪口呆，说不出话来。朋友问他为何吃惊，苏轼回答说是因为看到满园菊花落地，所以非常吃惊。苏轼这才明白过来，原来不是安石不通，而是自己自作聪明。苏轼心想自己被贬到黄州，大概是王安石看到自己续的那两句诗，所以让自己到此地亲眼看一看落地菊花。苏轼博览群书，学识渊博，也会犯自以为是的毛病。所以我们在学习求知的过程中，需要剔除偏见与自以为是的毛病。</p>
<p>落霞孤鹜图</p>
<p>虚心居义理，实心拒物欲</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心不可不虚①，虚则义理②来居；心不可不实③，实则物欲不入。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①虚：虚心，谦虚。</p>
<p>②义理：言辞、文章的含义和观点。</p>
<p>③实：充实，真实。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人不可以不虚心，虚心才能接纳真理和学问；一个人的心里不可以不充实，充实的内心才能抵制住各种物质欲望的诱惑。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>虚心的人才能接受真理，才能接受各种知识。宋朝时候的张咏是一个非常聪明的人，他不指定某一个人当他的耳目，而是更注重亲自调查研究。遇到事情他亲自到民间访查，很多事情经过仔细调查，多方询问之后能了解到真实情况。张咏说：“别人都有自己的好恶，这样会扰乱我的视听，我分别与各方面的人接触，不是只听一面之词。既向君子询问，也要向小人请教。这样就能对事情的真实情况有所了解了。”保持这种虚心的态度，不是用自己已有的意见看法去认识世界，这样才能接受真理。如果对待一切事情都自以为是，不能够虚心地接受别人的意见，不能够虚心地调查研究，这样也就无法获得真正的知识，也无法认识真理。</p>
<p>人既要虚心，又要使自己的内心充实。一个心中空无一物的人，是无法抵制各种诱惑的。许衡少年的时候，一天和同伴经过河阴，路上有梨树，结了不少果子。同行的人都争抢着爬到梨树上去摘梨吃，只有许衡不为所动，没有摘梨吃。同伴问他：“许衡，你怎么不摘梨吃啊？”许衡回答说：“不是自己的东西，却把它拿走是不对的。”同伴说：“现在是乱世，梨树的主人早已经不知道去哪里了。这棵梨树现在没有主人了。”许衡回答说：“梨树没有主人，我心里却有判断是非的道德标准。”正因为坚持自己的道德标准，所以许衡能够面对梨树却不摘梨。生活中，有许多人能够做到见利不忘义，面对各种各样的诱惑都能抵制住不动心，这是因为他们心中都有自己的是非观念、道德标准。具有充实丰富的内心，才不会在欲望之海中迷失方向。</p>
<p>性躁事无成，心和百福集</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>性躁心粗①者，一事无成；心和气平②者，百福自集。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①心粗：粗心。</p>
<p>②心和气平：心平气和。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>性情急躁粗心马虎的人，做任何事情都不会取得成功；心平气和性格温和的人，各种福分都会自然集中到他身上。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>性情急躁又粗心大意的人，往往做任何事情都不能做好。如果一个学生有粗心大意的毛病，在学习中不能耐心细致地进行学习，往往不能取得好成绩。如果一个人在工作中粗心大意，办事情又非常急躁，那么往往也不能出色地完成工作任务。</p>
<p>东晋时期的陶侃生性仔细认真，他在任荆州刺史的时候，命令人们把修造船只剩下来的木屑都全部收起来。大家不明白他的用意，但还是照着吩咐办了。过了一段时间，遇上雪后晴天，官府的大台阶又湿又滑，陶侃让人把木屑铺在台阶上，这样既不会妨碍人们走路，又能使台阶不那么湿滑难行了。官家用的竹子，陶侃让人们把截下来不用的竹子根全部都收起来。几年积攒下来，竹子根堆积如山。后来恒温带兵攻打后蜀，组装船只，这些竹子根就派上了用场，全部用来做了竹钉。细心的陶侃，使得看似废物的东西又发挥了重要作用。</p>
<p>三国时候的张飞，是一个性格非常急躁的人。但是当他偶尔克制自己急躁的性情，细心起来的时候，也能出一些非常好的主意。当时刘备得到猛将马超，十分高兴。刘备对马超非常重视，封他为都亭侯，拜为平西将军。但是马超在礼数上欠缺，对于许多礼节并不了解，见到刘备的时候常常直呼其名。关羽为此非常生气，对刘备说要杀死马超。刘备当然不会同意。这时候张飞献了一条妙计，他说：“我们应当做出示范，让马超看过之后，他自然会明白如何遵守礼仪了。”第二天，刘备召集将士开会，关羽与张飞都持刀站立在两旁。马超进来之后，看到关羽和张飞没有坐下来而是一直站立在刘备的身边，不禁大吃一惊。从此以后，马超对待刘备就格外恭敬了。张飞细心想出来的好主意，收到了非常好的效果。</p>
<p>浓艳试淡泊，纷纭勘镇定</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>淡泊之守，须从浓艳场①中试来；镇定之操②，还向纷纭境③上勘过。不然操持未定，应用未圆，恐一临机登坛④，而上品禅师又成一下品俗士矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①浓艳场：指繁华喧嚣的地方。</p>
<p>②操：操行，操守。</p>
<p>③纷纭境：纷乱嘈杂的地方。</p>
<p>④登坛：走上佛坛讲解佛法。坛，佛家进行祈祷法事的地方或者指讲经布道的讲台。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>淡泊的操守志向，需要经过荣华富贵、热闹喧嚣场所各种诱惑的考验；镇定自如的操守品质，还需要在纷乱嘈杂的环境中经受考验。不然人的操守与志向还不坚定，行动处事还不能圆满完善地应对，恐怕一遇到登坛讲经说法的机会，高僧也会变成凡人俗士了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个人的品德修养，需要经过实践的考验。平时镇定自若、宠辱不惊的人，也许遇到真正大的荣辱，会表现出与平时不一样的品行。一个平时表现很勇敢的人，也许处在真正危险的环境中，会表现出懦弱胆怯。所以要想培养优良品质，最好还是能够经受实践考验。经过实践考验后拥有的优良品质，才是真正的拥有。</p>
<p>五代时，后梁襄州管军务的官吏邹景温被改派到徐州任职。邹景温有一个仆人，身手不凡，有些本事。这个仆人仗着自己有些拳脚功夫，就带着妻子单独走。两个人骑着驴，走到一片水草地的时候，仆人得意地大叫起来：“我听说这地方向来有许多英雄豪杰，怎么今天没有一个出来与我一决胜负？”他话音刚落，就从草里跳出几个人来，把他紧紧抱住，双方搏斗了一番，仆人被压倒在地。强盗突然抽出短刀，切断了仆人的喉咙。仆人的妻子站在一边，看到了这一切。她一点都不惊慌害怕，反而大声叫嚷着：“真痛快啊！今天终于把我的耻辱都洗刷掉了。我终于报仇了。”她告诉强盗们说：“我本来是一个良家女子，谁知道被这个人强夺，强迫我跟着他走。现在他终于死了，真是老天开眼啊！”强盗们听了她的话，以为是真的，就没有杀她，带上她和行李，赶着两头驴子走了。走了几十里路，这些强盗们在一个村庄边停下休息。仆人妻子看到一家门口放着弓箭以及铠甲等物，想必官府中有人在此，于是径直走进大门。强盗们还以为她是去找东西吃，所以也没有怀疑她。仆人妻子见到了戌卒的总首，就向他报告了自己的丈夫遭到强盗杀害的事情。总首听了，立刻派人把强盗们抓住，捆绑起来。后来这些强盗被处死，仆人妻子返回了襄阳，没有再嫁人，去庙里当了尼姑。仆人妻子身处危险之中，能够保持镇定自若，随机应变保全了自己的生命，同时为丈夫报了仇，是真正勇敢的女子。</p>
<p>智小不谋大，趣卑不谈高</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鹩①占一枝，反笑鹏②心奢侈；兔营三窟，转嗤③鹤垒④高危。智小者不可以谋大，趣卑者不可与谈高。信然矣！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①鹩：一种体小尾短的小鸟，有黄色眉纹，捕食小虫，俗称巧妇鸟。《庄子•逍遥游》：“鹪鹩巢于深林，不过一枝。”</p>
<p>②鹏：传说中由鲲变化而来的一种大鸟。</p>
<p>③嗤：嘲笑。</p>
<p>④鹤垒：鹤的巢。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>鹩占据一条树枝，反过来嘲笑大鹏鸟飞翔高空的凌云壮志太宏大奢侈；兔子建造了三处窝穴，转过来嗤笑鹤筑造的巢穴过于高耸危险。智慧不足的人不可以同他们谋划大的事业，趣味低下的人不能和他们谈论高雅的事情。确实是这样啊！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>宋真宗的时候，盛度任尚书右丞，他为人十分稳重，少言寡语，很少称赞某事或者某人。有一次他在扬州做知府的时候，夏有章路过扬州。盛度设宴招待夏有章，并称赞他的才能。为此夏有章很是感动，就写了一首诗答谢盛度。谁知道盛度看到夏有章的诗之后，态度变得冷淡起来，后来还叫人把夏有章的信还给他，不愿意再和夏有章见面。夏有章感到很尴尬，并且非常不理解盛度为什么要这么做。他去拜访通判才绎，把这些事情都告诉了才绎。才绎猜测是夏有章的诗违背了盛度的心意。有人问盛度为什么对夏有章态度由热转为冷。盛度说：“没有别的原因。是因为我最初接触他的时候，看他气质风度脱俗，以为他是一个能成大器的人。可是看到他在诗中竟然自称是‘开发新天地的人’，仅得了一个幕官，就这样轻狂。你们看着吧，他做官也就做到现在这个位置，不会再提升了。他已经志得意满了。”后来夏有章得馆阁校勘职位，因为旧事牵连，被改派为国子监主簿，仍然保留着原官职，不久就死在京城里。夏有章因为在诗中流露出自己的志向短浅，被盛度鄙视。</p>
<p>志向短浅的人，不能理解志向远大的人。同样的，一个趣味低下的人，也不能理解趣味高雅的人。俗话说“人以群分，物以类聚”，确实是这样的。道不同不相为谋，与自己志向不同的人，没有必要多和他们费唇舌。与不能理解自己的人，说再多的话，解释再多次，也不能获得他们的理解，因此不如保持沉默，或者不和他们谈论志向趣味的话题。同时也需要注意，自己在别人眼中也有可能成为是目光短浅、趣味低下的人。所以我们需要培养远大的志向，培养高雅的情趣，对于别人的宏大理想不妄自加以嘲笑。</p>
<p>欲路毋染指，理路毋退步</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>欲路①上事，毋乐其便而姑为染指②，一染指便深入万仞③；理路④上事，毋惮⑤其难而稍为退步，一退步便远隔千山。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①欲路：泛指各种欲望。</p>
<p>②染指：比喻获取不属于自己的非分利益。</p>
<p>③仞：古代计量单位，八尺为一仞。</p>
<p>④理路：泛指各种真理、道理。</p>
<p>⑤惮：害怕，恐惧。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>关于欲望方面的事情，不要贪图它方便就随便参与，一参与进去就会掉进万丈深渊；关于真理方面的事情，不要因为害怕困难就止步不前，一退步就会和真理远远分隔开了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>顺从自己的欲望与抵制自己的欲望之间，往往是顺从自己的欲望更为方便容易。一个贪杯好酒的人准备戒酒，每次遇到别人邀请他去喝酒，他都需要进行一番艰难的思想斗争。跟着大家去喝酒，当然是非常快乐的事情，但是他一拿起酒杯就不能控制自己。贪杯好酒的结果，是使他胃出血，头疼欲裂。一时的方便快乐，往往要付出更大的代价。顺从自己的欲望，只能带来一时的欢乐，却会给人带来更多的痛苦与悔恨。追求真理，道路虽然曲折难行，但是最终能为我们带来自由与光明。马克思说过：“在科学的大道上没有平坦的道路，只有那些不畏艰难险阻沿着陡峭崎岖的山路努力攀登的人，才有希望达到光辉的顶点。”真理之路虽然难行，却能最终使我们走向光明，所以我们需要有不怕艰难险阻的精神，不断追求真理。</p>
<p>我们国家著名的数学家陈景润，攻克了世界著名数学难题“哥德巴赫猜想”中的“1+2”，距摘取数学皇冠上的明珠“1+1”只是一步之遥。邓小平曾经说过：“中国有一千个陈景润就了不得。”陈景润创造这个数学奇迹花费了数不尽的心血。他住在一间不到10平方米的小屋子里，耗费掉几麻袋的草稿纸，用一支笔，攻克世界数学难题。他阅读了大量的数学专著，为了能直接阅读外文资料，他学习了英语、法语、德语、日语、俄语等多国语言。他一心扑在研究中，简直达到废寝忘食的地步。对于日常生活中的有些商品，他甚至不知道叫什么名字。经过10多年的刻苦研究，他终于在数学领域取得辉煌成就。真理之路确实需要不怕吃苦的人，可是在付出艰苦努力之后，我们往往能有丰硕的收获。</p>
<p>溪山远眺图</p>
<p>勿凭意兴为，勿从情识悟</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>凭意兴作为者，随作则随止，岂是不退之车轮①？从情识解悟者，有悟则有迷，终作长明之灯烛②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①不退之车轮：佛家语，佛教认为，佛法能摧毁众生罪恶，能辗碎一切邪魔鬼怪，法轮并不停在一处，而是像车轮那样辗转滚动，因此称为不退之轮。</p>
<p>②长明之灯烛：寺庙中点的灯都叫长明灯，佛家说本智光明，因此就用长明灯比喻足智。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>凭一时兴趣去做事的人，等到兴趣消失了，事情也就跟着停止了。这样哪里是坚持不懈努力以便有所成就的做法呢？从情感意识角度领悟真理的人，有醒悟明白的地方也会有迷惑不解的地方，终究不能像长久光明的灵智明灯那样，一直清楚明白。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在少年的时候，也许我们很多人都有宏远的理想。有人想当科学家，有人想当政治家，还有人想成为艺术家……人们的梦想是无穷无尽、各式各样的。但是很多人成熟以后，某一天回过头来看，把自己当年的愿望付诸实际的人并不多。这当然有很多原因，有一些是由于客观条件不允许，无法实现自己的理想，还有一些人是因为虽然努力过了，但是目标过于宏大，所以没有实现。但是其中还有一个非常重要的因素，是由于人们没有持之以恒的耐心与毅力。坚强的意志力，恒久的耐心，对于理想目标而言异常重要。人们在为自己设立目标的时候，需要从自己的实际出发，多方面考虑，而不是从一时兴趣出发。从一时兴趣出发为自己设立的目标，往往不能长久坚持下去。</p>
<p>中国有句成语叫“叶公好龙”，说的是有一个被称为叶公的人，非常喜欢龙。他的家中墙壁上、走廊上，都贴满了各种各样龙的图画。他整天画龙，爱龙成癖。天上的真龙知道这件事情后，非常感动，于是就来到叶公的家里。叶公看到真龙从天而降，顿时吓得面如土色，掉头就跑。在生活中，我们很多人也正如叶公一样，对很多事情看似喜欢，但实际上未必是真正的喜欢。所以我们需要了解自己的真正兴趣爱好，不可以凭着一时兴趣或者一时冲动就决定去做某件事情。如果这件事情根本不符合自己的志趣，最终恐怕会半途而废，白白浪费了自己的时间与精力，实在是得不偿失的做法。学习需要运用自己的理性思考，不带有自己的感情色彩去看待问题，这样才能得到没有偏见的真理，才是真正认识把握事物的做法。</p>
<p>口乃心之门，意乃心之足</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>口乃心之门，守口不密，泄尽真机；意乃心之足，防意不严，走尽邪蹊①。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①邪蹊：邪僻小路。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>口是人心的大门，大门防守不严密，人心中的机密就全泄露出去；意志是人心的腿脚，假如意志不坚定，就会走向邪僻小路。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>我们俗话常说一个人说话毫无顾忌、口无遮拦，就像是嘴上没有把门的。在现实生活中，心直口快虽然是一个人直爽性格的表现，但是有时候这种心直口快的做法会给自己或者他人带来很多困扰。很多时候，有些话能说，有些话需要守口如瓶。用语言来表达自己的思想意识，很多时候都有局限性。同样的话语，在不同的环境中，在不同的人群中听来，有时候会产生不同的含义。就像很多讽刺作品中描述的那样，同样的一件事情，经过大家传来传去，最后变得面目全非。</p>
<p>安徒生童话中，有这样一个故事。一只小母鸡，不小心掉了几根鸡毛。这个时候闲话就传开了。最开始传的是有一只母鸡因为要变得美丽，所以自己拔掉了几根毛，接下来这几根毛就变得数量多了起来，传到后来几根毛变成了全部的毛。还有的鸡添油加醋地说，这只掉毛的鸡是为了吸引异性的注意才把自己的毛剃掉的。到后来故事中的主角，那只掉了几根鸡毛的小母鸡也颇有兴趣地参加到传话当中来，并没有察觉自己就是故事中的主角。同样其他的鸡们也并不在乎故事的主角是谁，这些鸡们只是在享受传闲话的乐趣。这样的故事听来虽然好笑，但是在现实生活中却并不缺少这样的例子。所以我们需要有意识地加以注意有些话可以说，有些话还是放在心中更好。意志不坚定，思想不正确，就会引导人走向邪路。所以我们还需要注意，培养坚强的意志力，在是非问题上坚持正确的原则，以此来避免被引入邪路。</p>
<p>身虽在事中，心要超事外</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>波浪兼天①，舟中不知惧，而舟外者寒心；猖狂骂座，席上不知警，而席外者咋舌②。故君子身虽在事中，心要超事外也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①兼天：连天。</p>
<p>②咋舌：咬舌，形容吃惊、害怕，说不出话或不敢说话。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>波浪连天，坐在船中的人不知道害怕，船外边的人却吓得胆战心惊；酒席上猖狂的人谩骂别人，酒席上的人不知道警惕，反而把酒席外的人吓得说不出话来。因此有良好德行的君子，虽然参与某件事，但是心却超脱于事情之外。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“当局者迷，旁观者清”，参与到某件事情中，有时候往往不如旁观的人对事情看得更为清楚。苏东坡学士有一首诗曰：“横看成岭侧成峰，远近高低各不同。不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。”观察事物，角度不相同，对于事物的认识也不相同。如果能置身于事情之外，有时反而能够获知事物的真面目。</p>
<p>南唐徐铉学识渊博，才华出众。有一次，徐铉来北宋纳贡。满朝文武大臣都知道徐铉之名，他见多识广，口才非常好，因此大家都自觉不敌徐铉的辩才，不愿意去做使臣。丞相赵普也不知道该派谁去比较好，就去向宋太祖请教。宋太祖说：“你们都退下吧，我亲自来挑选。”过了一会儿，太祖要宦官们下命令，让殿前司写出十个不认识字的殿中侍者的名字送过来。殿前司写好后，宦官送给太祖。宋太祖拿过来，看也不看，御笔一挥随便点了其中一个人的名字。太祖这样做，使得在朝官员们都很吃惊。赵普就催促那个被点中的人赶快动身。被点名的殿中侍者根本不知道为什么要派他去做使臣，而且又没有人给他解释，只好带着疑惑去执行命令。殿中侍者一见到徐铉，徐铉就开始口若悬河、滔滔不绝地讲话，周围的人都被徐铉的能言善辩所打动，为之钦服。殿中侍者无言以对，只是一味地点头说是。徐铉不知道这位殿中侍者究竟何许人也，也不知道他学识深浅如何，因此更加卖力地和他讲话。一连几天，徐铉说得口干舌燥，殿中侍者始终不和徐铉争辩，徐铉终于疲累不堪，停下来不肯讲话了。这个故事说的是以愚人对付聪明人，使得聪明人无计可施。但是换一个角度看，殿中侍者正是由于对自己为何被派为使臣的原因不清楚，所以能置身事外，任由徐铉表现辩才，而不和徐铉争辩，最终使得徐铉的辩才毫无用武之地。</p>
<p>遇好书良友，享碗茗炉烟</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>千载奇逢，无如好书良友；一生清福，只在碗茗炉烟①。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①碗茗炉烟：炉中点着烟，碗中泡着茶。形容闲适自在的生活。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>千年难遇的好东西，都比不上好书与好朋友；一生清闲自在的生活，就在于碗中茶与炉中轻烟之中。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>与三五好友，相约着品茶交谈，品着好茶，享受着熏炉中散发出来的宜人香气，这种生活确实十分惬意自在。千载难逢的好东西都比不上一本好书，比不上一位贤良的好朋友。一本好书能使人终身受益。好读书的人，善于学习求知。不论人们从事哪个行业，如果爱好读书学习，都有利于在本领域内有所成就。古今中外有所成就的人，都是善于学习求知的人。就是身为帝王，也需要读书求知。</p>
<p>宋太宗就很喜欢读书，他非常好学勤奋，常常去皇宫中藏书的地方读书，不但自己喜欢读书，还喜欢召集一些大臣陪着读书。南唐后主李煜文采斐然，有时候宋太宗就把降宋的李煜和南汉后主刘鋠都叫来陪读。宋太宗喜欢读书，就搜寻天下名书，令翰林学士们汇编成《天平御览》一千卷，每天让人拿来三卷，刻苦读书。他打算在一年内把这些书都读完。有的大臣劝他这样太辛苦了，宋太宗却说开卷有益，不觉得辛苦。宋太宗身为皇帝，却知道刻苦读书，其精神非常值得我们学习。</p>
<p>在现代社会中，知识更新换代的速度非常快。一个人一辈子所有的时间都花在读书上，所能读的书也是非常有限的，更何况现在社会中人们会面对很多问题，不可能把所有的时间都花在读书学习上。所以我们需要有效利用学习时间，有选择地读书，选择一些好书来读，把学习时间花在最值得的事情上面。</p>
<p>日与圣贤语，时共造化氲</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>蓬茅①下诵诗读书，日日与圣贤晤语，谁云贫是病？樽罍②边幕天席地③，时时共造化氤氲④，孰谓醉非禅⑤？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①蓬茅：蓬草和茅草，这里指茅草屋。</p>
<p>②樽罍：樽与罍都是古代盛酒器。</p>
<p>③幕天席地：把天当幕，把地当席，形容心胸开阔。</p>
<p>④氤氲：烟雾弥漫的样子，气与光混合动荡的样子。</p>
<p>⑤禅：梵语“禅那”的简称，指静思。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在茅草屋下诵读诗书，每天都能和古代圣贤对话交谈，谁能说贫穷是一种病呢？以天为幕，以地为席，举杯畅饮，时时都能和天地自然融为一体，谁能说醉酒不是静思悟道呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>爱好学习，品格高尚，对生活有所追求的人在清苦的生活环境中依然能过得非常有意义。有这样一个故事，说的是有一个青年，他本来学业优秀，考上了一所著名大学。就在他准备读大学的时候，家里突然发生了非常不幸的事情，他的父亲与母亲在一场事故中丧失了生命。他把自己的大学录取通知书收藏起来，收拾了自己的东西到城市里打工。他没有什么特长，只是从前父母忙的时候，他经常做饭。因此他就买了锅碗瓢盆等器具，在街上摆摊卖水饺、面条、肉饼等小吃。他卖的小吃很受人们欢迎，只是他没有本钱开店，在街上摆摊时常会遇到城管。城管一来，他的东西就会被没收。他住在一个简陋的平房内，每天凌晨4点多一点，就得起来包饺子、擀面条，每天晚上将近11点才收摊。生活的辛苦之外，还需要东躲西藏地逃避城管。他赚的钱除了自己的开销之外，全部都寄给了读中学的妹妹。就是在这样的生活环境中，他还时常抽出时间来看书学习。后来当妹妹能够自立之后，他通过自考，考上研究生继续深造。</p>
<p>江渔隐图</p>
<p>爱喝酒的人，对于酒的痴好，有时候也是一种豁达对待人生的表现。《智囊》上有一个故事，说的是东晋的时候，庾冰是吴郡太守，遇到有人叛乱，庾冰与众人失散，只身一人逃亡。有一名士兵划着小船载着庾冰出钱塘口。士兵用粗竹席盖在庾冰身上，把他掩藏起来。当时叛乱者苏峻悬赏缉拿庾冰，搜查得很紧。士兵把船停在码头上就去喝酒，喝酒回来后，挥舞着船桨大喊：“你们到哪里找太守庾冰？我这船里就有。”庾冰非常恐慌，不敢出声动弹。搜查的人看到船很窄小，以为士兵在说醉话，反而不怀疑船中藏人。庾冰因此得以逃脱。后来事情平定之后，庾冰要报答那个士兵，就问他想要什么，士兵回答说：“我出身卑微，不希望要名望地位。从前我赶车很辛苦，想痛痛快快喝酒却总不能实现。如果我能在余生有足够的酒喝，就心满意足了，此外别无所求。”庾冰就为他建造房屋，买了奴婢，为他储藏了大量美酒，够他一辈子喝的。这位士兵对待人生不贪求功名利禄，只要求有足够的酒喝就心满意足，不是一个俗人。</p>
<p>涤尽心渣滓，始见本真体</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>为善①而欲自高②胜人，施恩而欲要名结好③，修业④而欲惊世骇俗⑤，植节⑥而欲标异见奇⑦，此皆是善念中戈矛⑧，理路上荆棘⑨，最易夹带⑩，最难拔除者也。须是涤尽渣滓⑪，斩绝萌芽，才见本来真体⑫。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①为善：行善，做好事。</p>
<p>②自高：抬高自己，超过别人。</p>
<p>③结好：交结，亲近。</p>
<p>④修业：学习知识，研究学问。业，古人读书写字用的版。修业也指修营功业，据《易•乾•文言》：“君子进德修业。”</p>
<p>⑤惊世骇俗：言行怪异使世人感到震惊。世、俗，都指一般人。</p>
<p>⑥植节：培养操守气节。植，栽种，种植。节，本义竹节，这里指气节、节操。</p>
<p>⑦标异见奇：表现与众不同显现奇特。标异，表现与众不同。宋•苏轼《论河北京东盗贼状》：“或多聚徒众，或广置兵仗，或标异服饰。”见，显现、显示。据《广雅》：“见，示也。”见奇，显现奇特。</p>
<p>⑧戈矛：戈和矛，泛指兵器。汉•张衡《东京赋》：“戈矛若林，牙旗缤纷。”</p>
<p>⑨荆棘：两者常丛生阻塞道路。荆，荆条，无刺。棘，酸枣，有刺。</p>
<p>⑩夹带：夹杂，混杂。</p>
<p>⑪渣滓：杂质、残渣。</p>
<p>⑫真体：真实的本体。佛家语，本相，实相。这里指事物的真实情况或本来面目。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>做善事想要抬高自己超过别人，施人恩惠想要博取好名声结交别人，修营功业想要震惊世人，培养节操想要表现怪异显示奇特，这些都是善良念头中的凶恶之气，真理道路上的阻碍，最容易混杂夹带，最难清楚了。必须要清除干净残渣，斩断萌芽，这样才能显现真实面目。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>黄霸和令狐子伯是朋友。子伯在楚国为相，他的儿子也当了官。有一天，子伯派儿子送信给黄霸。客人走后，黄霸躺在床上想心事。他的妻子问他怎么了，黄霸说：“刚才看到令狐的儿子，言行举止得体，光彩夺目。可是我们的儿子却蓬头乱发，牙齿还稀疏不齐，又不懂什么礼节规矩。见了客人也不大方，举止瑟缩羞惭。我身为父亲，看到自己的儿子比不上别人，不由得感到自愧，这都是我的过错啊。”妻子说：“你少年时代保持高洁的品行节操，不贪恋荣华富贵，现在以子伯与你相比，哪一个更高洁呢？你怎么反而忘了平时的志向，为自己的儿子感到惭愧呢！”黄霸听了，从床上起来，赞同妻子的话，他们一家人隐居起来了。黄霸保持高洁的品行，虽然一时之间想不开，为自己的儿子不如朋友的儿子显贵而感到羞愧，但是经过妻子的开导，他认识到了保持高洁的品行，又何必在意自己的儿子不如人家显贵呢。保持高洁的品行，却过于在意世俗的眼光，或者从世俗的眼光去看问题，这都是修行欠缺的表现。</p>
<p>宋钦宗时的太宰李邦彦，他的父亲从前是一个制作银器的银匠。有人就此事嘲笑他，李邦彦感到很羞愧。他回家把这件事情告诉了他母亲。他的母亲说：“丞相家中出了银匠，那才是令人感到羞愧的事情，银匠家中出了丞相，这是值得称道的事情，有什么好羞愧的！”李邦彦的母亲是有智慧的女子，能够看到出身低微并不可耻，不努力上进才是真正可耻的事情。努力建功立业，真正建立一些实际的功业才是最重要的，与他人比出身、比名气，都是阻碍自己前进的路障。所以做善事不要夹杂私心，施人恩惠不要期望从别人那里获得一些好处。修营功业要做实际的事情，不要贪慕虚名。培养节操不要表现怪异，也不要过于在意别人的目光，只踏踏实实做好自己的事情就好。</p>
<p>闲时身须忙，收摄心可放</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>身不宜忙，而忙于闲暇之时，亦①可警惕②惰③气；心不可放，而放于收摄④之后，亦可鼓畅⑤天机⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①亦：又，也。</p>
<p>②警惕：警觉，小心戒备。</p>
<p>③惰：懒惰，懈怠。</p>
<p>④收摄：收敛，约束。</p>
<p>⑤鼓畅：鼓动使畅通。</p>
<p>⑥天机：天赋灵性。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>身体不宜过于忙碌，而在空闲的时候忙碌起来，又可以消除身上的懒惰懈怠之气；心思不可以过于放松，而在收敛约束之后放松，又可以激发人的天赋灵性。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>过于忙碌与过于放松都不好，过于忙碌容易使人忙出病来，对于人的身心健康不利。过于忙碌，也不利于人们处理好事情，不利于发挥积极的创造性。过于放松，又容易使人生出懒惰懈怠等毛病，丧失积极进取的动力。所以忙碌之后适当的休息是非常必要的，空闲之后的忙碌能使人身心充实。</p>
<p>许多优秀的学者都是善于调节身心的人，他们在工作的时候会全力以赴，全身心扑在研究工作中。当他们忙碌过一段时间后，又会找适当的方式放松身心。李四光是我国著名的地质学家，他在科学领域的贡献很多人都知道，但是很多人并不知道他在音乐方面同样造诣深厚。他的小提琴拉得很好，还曾经写过一首小提琴曲。他的散文写得很好，还会写诗。这些都是他在忙碌之余休息放松身心的方式。钱学森是我国著名的科学家，为我国航天事业做出了非常重要的贡献，荣获两弹一星功勋奖章，贡献一生力量致力于科学发展事业。钱学森也是一位音乐爱好者，他对于音乐的爱好得益于他的妻子蒋英。蒋英是一位歌唱家，她熏陶了丈夫对于音乐的爱好。钱学森在科学研究工作之余，沉浸在音乐世界中。他曾和妻子共同写作了《对发展音乐事业的一些意见》一文，对于发展音乐事业提出许多建设性意见。在1991年中共中央为钱学森举行的颁奖仪式上，钱学森提到他的夫人蒋英引导他对音乐产生兴趣时说：“她为我介绍了音乐艺术，使我丰富了对世界的深刻认识，学会了广阔的思维方法。”对于音乐的爱好，没有阻碍钱学森的科学研究事业，相反对于音乐的爱好，为钱学森提供了广阔的视野，使他对于世界的认识更加深刻。</p>
<p>名为招祸本，欲乃散志媒</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>钟鼓①体虚，为声闻而招击撞②；麋鹿③性逸，因豢养④而受羁縻⑤。可见名为招祸之本，欲乃散志之媒，学者不可不力为扫除也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①钟鼓：钟和鼓，古代礼乐器。</p>
<p>②击撞：敲打。</p>
<p>③麋鹿：麋与鹿，或单指麋鹿。古人常用麋鹿比喻隐逸之志。据李白《山人欢酒》诗：“各守麋鹿志，耻随龙虎争。”</p>
<p>④豢养：饲养，喂养。</p>
<p>⑤羁縻：约束，控制。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>钟和鼓的体型是中间空，因为被撞击能发出声音而为自己招来经常被撞击的祸事；麋与鹿性情闲适安逸，因为被驯养而受到约束。由此可见名声是招惹祸事的根源，欲望是使人心志涣散的中介，学者不可以不全力清除欲望和名声啊。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>名声在外，有时并不是好事，名声有可能会为自己带来祸事。有一个学者，他在没有出名之前，可以集中精力做事情，当他出名之后，各种各样的事情占去他很多时间。有人请他吃饭，有人请他作报告，有人请他演讲，还有人请他讲课，也有人请他写书，很多都不是他愿意做的，可是又推脱不掉。他非常怀念没有出名之前，集中精力、全力以赴地做研究的时光。</p>
<p>北魏的崔巨伦很有名望，曾经担任过殷州别将。当殷州被攻陷之后，葛荣听到崔巨伦有名望与才干，就想任用他帮助自己。崔巨伦不愿意跟随葛荣，只好想办法让自己脱身。葛荣召集百官，命崔巨伦作诗。崔巨伦写了一首搞笑的歪诗，掩藏自己的才能，葛荣也就放弃了他，崔巨伦从而得以脱身。可见名声在外，有时会给自己招惹来各种各样的麻烦事。</p>
<p>舒适的生活环境虽然使人身心舒适安逸，却也会消磨人的意志，侵蚀人的斗志。爱因斯坦是一位伟大的科学家。有一天，他在纽约街道上遇见一个朋友。这个朋友说：“爱因斯坦先生，您似乎需要换一件新大衣了。您身上这件似乎太旧了。”爱因斯坦不以为意地说：“这有什么关系呢，反正在这里谁也不认识我，没有必要为穿什么衣服发愁。”又过了几年之后，爱因斯坦与那位朋友又在纽约街头相遇了。这个时候，爱因斯坦已是天下闻名了，却还是穿着从前那件旧大衣。朋友又建议爱因斯坦换一件新大衣。爱因斯坦回答说：“没有这个必要，反正在这里大部分人都认识我了。”爱因斯坦全身心投入到科学研究中去，对自己穿什么样的衣服不在意，并不追求舒适的生活，这也是他能够在科学研究上取得突破性进展的重要原因。</p>
<p>完心上本来，得世间常道</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>完得心上之本来①，方可言了心②；尽③得世间之常道④，才堪⑤论出世⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①本来：指人本来就有的本质。</p>
<p>②了心：了解，明白。了，知道、明白。</p>
<p>③尽：完全，达到极限。</p>
<p>④常道：事物中隐藏的规律与法则。据《荀子•天论》：“天有常道矣，地有常数矣。”</p>
<p>⑤堪：可以，足以。</p>
<p>⑥出世：超脱人世束缚。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>完全认识了自己的本来面目，才可以说是明白了心性；理解透彻世间的基本规律法则，才能够谈论超脱人世。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>真正认识了自己的本性，才可以说是对自己有了真正了解。有一个小姑娘，她想学芭蕾舞，还想学骑马、弹钢琴。她对读书绘画也非常感兴趣。虽然她想学的东西很多，但是现实条件不允许，她最终只能学习绘画，同时还拥有足够的书可以读。这两件事情已经占用了她大部分的时间。后来当她上学之后，家中境况变得好转起来，父母有能力送她去学她想学的东西。她终于有机会去学自己渴盼很久的芭蕾舞与钢琴，她还跟着人学习骑马。学了一段时间后，她发现自己其实对于芭蕾舞、钢琴并不是真正感兴趣，她一直以为自己喜欢的东西其实并不能真正地感染她。所以我们在真正全面认识自己的本性之前，不能说已对自己有了全面了解。</p>
<p>究竟自己的本性是什么样的，这不是一下子就能获得答案的问题。对于自己的了解与认识，需要在实践中去获知。在学校学习的过程中，不仅是学习知识，培养良好的道德品质，还是一个通过不断学习来发现自己的过程。很多人在谈到学校教育究竟是不是必要的时候，都会提起美国的比尔•盖茨，盖茨退学创业，最终成为世界首富，使得很多人对学校教育的作用发出质疑。其实盖茨之所以退学，是因为他已经找到自己的兴趣所在，发现了自己值得为之努力的人生目标。很多人还需要在学校学习，一个非常重要的原因是他们对于自己的人生还没有清晰的规划，对于自己还没有彻底全面的了解，所以需要在继续学习中获知真实的自我。当然也有不少人，在学校中读了很多年书，感觉愈发迷茫，没能够对自己有清晰全面的认识，因此需要参加工作，到社会上磨砺自我，以便于能发现真实的自我。在对自己有了清晰的认识，对世界也有了比较全面的认识后，这时候才可以谈论超脱世俗。如果对于世界没有一定的认识了解，又何谈超脱世俗呢！</p>
<p>塞物欲之路，弛尘俗之肩</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>塞得物欲之路，才堪辟道义之门；弛①得尘俗之肩，方可挑圣贤之担。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①弛：放下，丢弃。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>堵塞了物质欲望的道理，才能够开启真理道义的大门；放得下肩头世俗的担子，才能够挑起圣贤的重担。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>商朝纣王接任王位不久，就让人为他雕琢了一把象牙筷子。大臣箕子感叹说：“有了象牙筷子，必然不能再使用土瓦做的食器，将会使用犀牛角以及玉做的食具。有了玉杯象牙筷子，必然不能再吃粗茶淡饭，而要吃美味佳肴。也必然不愿意住在简陋的房屋内，而要住在高楼广室之中。同样也不会再穿粗布做的衣服，而要穿华丽的衣服。这样下去，他的欲望是无法得到满足的，肯定会去远方收集各国珍奇怪异的东西，需要华贵的车子与豪华的宫室。我真是为他担心啊！”果然过了不久纣王就建造鹿台，金碧辉煌，华丽异常。搜罗了众多奇珍异兽、狗马宝物等，水池中装满了酒，肉悬挂起来多得像树林子一样。商纣王过着奢侈豪华的生活，不久全国人民就起来造反，最后商纣王投身火海中被烧死。</p>
<p>五代时后汉的慕容彦超任节度使。慕容彦超喜欢聚敛银钱，他曾经设库房收纳抵押的钱财。有一个奸诈的人制造了假银子来抵押。后来被主管的官吏发现银子是假的，就报告了慕容彦超。慕容彦超教给官吏一个办法，让他晚上挖开库房的墙，把里面的钱物转移到别的地方去，然后公布说失盗。让那些抵押的人前来自报他们所抵押的物品，以便给予他们赔偿。于是人们都前来报告，这样抵押假银子的人也找到了。慕容彦超没有惩罚这个人，反而把这个人藏在一个隐蔽的地方，让他教别人制造假银子。这些假银子是用铁做芯，外面包上了一层银子皮，名叫“铁胎银”。后来后周的兵马前来攻城，慕容彦超拿出库存的银子犒赏士兵。大家说这是铁胎银，不是真银子，因而不肯为彦超效力。慕容彦超无奈自杀身亡。</p>
<p>商纣王不知道节制自己的欲望，一味顺从自己的欲望，最终惹得人民纷纷起来反抗，他因此丢掉了性命，成为中国历史上暴君、昏君的典型。慕容彦超虽有智谋，可惜不用在正当的地方，只知道为自己聚敛钱财，最终害了自己。所以我们在为自己树立人生目标的时候，需要切记，要想实现自己的人生目标，最终有所作为，就需要克制自己的欲望。只有那些超脱凡俗，不被利欲羁绊的人，才能担起重大的责任。</p>
<p>千江一轮月，心珠宜独朗</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>一勺水便具四海水味，世法①不必尽尝；千江月总是一轮月光，心珠②宜当独朗。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①世法：佛家语，对出世法而言，佛教把世间一切生灭无常的事物都叫作世法。《华严经•世主妙严品》：“佛观世法如光影。”</p>
<p>②心珠：佛家语，佛家认为人的心性本来纯洁如珠。《景德传灯录•僧那禅师》：“既不堕有无处所，则心珠独朗。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一勺水便具有四海水的味道，因此没有必要把世间的一切生灭道理都亲自体验；千条江水中的月亮，都是天上一轮明月的影子，所以我们的心性也要明朗如珠。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>世界上的万事万物，各有各的形态，但是在千变万化的世界当中，存在一定的规律。如果能把握事物中存在的规律，那么在认识世界的时候，也就能够对世界有更深刻的认识，不至于抓不住头绪。纷繁复杂的世界，看上去杂乱无序，其实只要抓住规律，很多时候便能一通百通了。有些道理是放之四海而皆准的，我们没有必要一个一个地去体验，事事都亲自体验既不切合实际，也不可能实现。人们常说四海如一家，世界虽然宽广辽阔，但是却有很多相似的地方。置身于不同的城市，城市之间虽然不可能完全相同，但是却总会使人发现城市之间有很多地方都是相像的。置身于不同的学校，虽然学校之间在硬件与软件设备方面有很大不同，但是同时也存在许多相似的地方。了解某一个事物，那么对于与该事物相像的其他事物也就都能有所了解了。</p>
<p>这就像是科学研究一样，每当科学家有了新的发现，他们往往是做了一些实验，再经过系统论证发明的可靠性，就会把这种新发明投入使用，而不是把这种发明用在所有人或物身上进行试验。苏格兰科学家亚历山大•弗莱明从事流感研究工作，他在实验室里培养葡萄球菌，这是一种引起传染性皮肤病和脓肿的常见细菌。有一天，他忘记给一个盛有葡萄球菌的培植盘子盖上盖子就出去了。等他回来的时候，他发现盘子中长出一团青绿色霉菌。他用显微镜观察发现，青绿色霉菌把周围的葡萄球菌全部都消灭了。这也就是说，青绿色的霉菌能够扼杀葡萄球菌。由此弗莱明发现了青霉素。弗莱明的偶然发现，经过医学家的研究，终于用于临床医学，为人类抵抗疾病起到非常重要的作用。世界各地的人们虽然相互之间存在很大差异，但是同时也存在很多相通的地方。一国医药的发展，同时能对其他国家医药发展起到推动作用。我们能够借鉴吸收别国的先进科学技术，而没有必要去一一加以实践证明，这归根结底还是由于变化万千的世界存在一些共同的道理与规律。正如千江明月其实都是天上明月的影子一样，如果我们能保持清朗的心性，善于把握事物的根源所在，也就能够对于世界有更清醒的认识。</p>

<p>难灭情舍欲，可平情寡欲</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>情之同处即为性，舍情则性不可见；欲之公处即为理，舍欲则理不可明。故君子不能灭情，惟①事平情②而已；不能灭欲，惟期③寡欲④而已。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①惟：只有，只是。</p>
<p>②平情：感情平和，不偏激。</p>
<p>③期：期望。</p>
<p>④寡欲：欲望少，节制欲望。寡，浅、少。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>与情感共处的就是人的本性，舍弃情感那么人的本性就不能显现出来；与欲望共处的就是义理，舍弃欲望那么义理也就不能明白了。所以君子不能消灭情感，只是使感情平和不偏激而已；不能消灭欲望，只是减少欲望罢了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>情感与本性是一对矛盾，没有了情感，人的本性也就不能显现出来了。欲望与义理是一对矛盾，很多道理正是针对人的各种欲望阐发的，人没有了欲望，各种义理也就讲不明白了。人不能完全消灭感情，也不能彻底消灭自己的欲望。俗话说人都有七情六欲，对于人的情感与欲望，可以适当控制但不可能完全消灭。</p>
<p>安徒生童话故事中，有一篇《天国花园》的故事，讲的是有一个王子有一天在森林里散步。突然天下起雨来，他找到了一个大山洞避雨。在这里他遇到一位老太太，这个老太太是东南两北风的母亲。老太太邀请王子烤火，告诉他这里是风之洞。东南西北风回来之后，讲述了他们各自的经历。王子听他们谈到天国花园，非常羡慕，很想去那里看一看。东风告诉王子：“如果你想去，明天我可以带你一起去。不过自从亚当和夏娃以后，什么人也没有到那里去过。亚当和夏娃被赶出去之后，天国花园就沉下去了。不过那里还保留着各种美景，各位仙人住在那里。明天你可以坐在我背上，我带你去那里。”第二天，王子跟着东风飞行。他们飞过了很多地方，经过一个冰冷的大洞口，最后来到一个风景格外优美的地方，这里就是天国花园。花园里住着仙女，年轻美丽又非常温柔。王子跟着仙女在天国花园里散步，王子喜欢这个地方，他问仙女自己能不能永远住在这里。仙女回答说：“这由你自己决定，如果你能够不去做违禁的事情，不要像亚当那样，你就可以永远住在这里。如果你的意志不够坚强，你还是和东风一起回去吧，他100年后才会再到这里来。每天晚上，我都会对你说：‘跟我来吧！’我会向你招手，但是你不能动。如果你跟着我走，你的欲望就会增多。我住在长着知识之树的大厅。如果你在我身边弯下腰来，我必然会向你微笑。如果你吻了我，天国就会沉到地下，你也就失去了天国，忧愁和苦恼将伴随着你。”王子坚持要在这里住下来，东风和王子告別后离开了。太阳落下去，仙女向王子招手，王子跟着她走。他忘记了自己的诺言。看着美丽的仙女，王子情不自禁地吻了仙女，于是天国沉陷下去了，王子后悔不及。虽然明知道是错误的，还是要情不自禁地犯错误，这是因为人无法完全消除自己的欲望，不过可以将自己的感情欲望适当加以控制。</p>
<p>五更勘心体，饮食谙世味</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>从五更①枕席②上参勘③心体④，气未动，情未萌，才见本来面目；向三时⑤饮食中谙练⑥世味⑦，浓不欣，淡不厌，方为切实功夫。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①五更：古时从黄昏到天明，一夜间被分为甲、乙、丙、丁、戊五个时间段，称之为五更。又叫五鼓、五夜。五更也特指第五更的时候，也就是天快亮的时候。</p>
<p>②枕席：枕头和席子，睡觉的地方。</p>
<p>③参勘：检验，对比核查。参，参照、检验。勘，核对、核查。《说文新附》：“勘，校也。”</p>
<p>④心体：本体，古时有以心为思想主体的理论。也指精神与肉体。</p>
<p>⑤三时：指一天中早、午、晚三个时间段。</p>
<p>⑥谙练：熟悉，熟练。</p>
<p>⑦世味：人情世故的滋味。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>清早在没有起床的时候思考琢磨自己的内心本性，这个时候心中杂念邪思等浮躁之气还没有产生，感情还没有萌动，这才能见到自己的本来面目；从一日三餐中熟悉人世间的各种滋味，滋味肥美不过于高兴，滋味寡淡也不厌恶，这才是真正的功夫。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>驱散心中的浮躁之气，遏制自己的各种欲望邪念，这样才能见到自己的本来面目。人世间的滋味就好比一日三餐，味道鲜美不用太高兴，滋味寡淡了也不要厌恶，以平和的心态对待生活中的得失荣辱。荣华富贵的滋味虽然如美味佳肴那样肥美浓烈，可是带来的危险也是巨大的。平淡简朴的生活虽然滋味寡淡，可是也更安稳。</p>
<p>唐朝时候，来俊臣曾经得势。有一位叫侯敏的官员在妻子的劝告下，疏远了来俊臣。来俊臣看到侯敏疏远他，非常恼怒，就派侯敏到外地做县令。侯敏不想去，想辞官回家。他的妻子告诉他：“去上任吧，不要请求留下来。”于是侯敏就动身上路了。到了那个地方，他投递名帖求见上司。上司发现他名帖上有个地方写错了，就大发雷霆道：“连自己的名帖都出错误，这样的人有什么才干当县令。”于是就不批准侯敏去上任。侯敏为此事苦恼，他的妻子说：“不要苦恼，放宽心在这里住着吧。”过了几十天之后，侯敏本打算去当县令的那个地方有人造反，造反的人杀了旧县令，把县令的家烧杀掠夺一空。侯敏因为上司没有批准他上任，因而保全了性命。以平常心态对待生活，顺其自然，福祸之间可以转化。看似祸害，以平常心态对待，祸害反而变成福气。</p>
<p>战国时楚王聘请陈子仲为相，子仲对妻子说：“我为相，出门可以坐车，吃饭能吃精美食物。”他的妻子说：“高头大马拉的车，你也只不过能占据一点地方罢了。满桌子精美食物，你能吃的也不过是一部分罢了。大家都贪恋美味佳肴与车马威风，使得楚国陷于忧患之中。迷恋享受，恐怕连性命都会丢掉。”陈子仲认为妻子说得很有道理，于是和妻子一同隐居，为别人浇灌菜园子，也不愿再做官了。做官虽然风光，做官带来的危险也是巨大的。</p>
<p>在生活中，以平和的心态对待生活中的起落得失，得意不过分欢喜，失意不过分厌恶，领悟生活的真味。时常端详自己的真心，了解自己的本来面目，也许能够使我们放弃一些不必要的追求，了解真实的自我，创造自己的生命价值。</p>
<p>静夜观心时，妄穷真独露</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>夜深人静，独坐观心①，始觉妄穷②而真独露③。每于此中得大机趣④，既觉真现而妄难逃，又于此中得大惭悔。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①观心：佛家语。观察心性，自我反省。据《辞海》注：“观察心性如何谓之观心。”</p>
<p>②妄穷：虚妄的念头消失。妄，虚妄。</p>
<p>③真独露：本真显现。真：真境，佛家讲脱离妄见达到涅般境界。</p>
<p>④机趣：生机趣味。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>夜深人静的时候，一个人独自坐下来反省观察自己的内心，才发现邪思杂念都消失了，自己的本真自然显现出来。每当这个时候都能从中体会到许多生命的生机与趣味，领悟人生的道理。既发觉本真出现的可贵，又难以完全消除妄念，所以感觉到非常惭愧后悔。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>夜深人静的时候，独自坐下来反省自身，往往能发现自己的真正本性。真心如皓月当空，皎洁光明，没有一丝遮掩，妄心就像明镜生尘，明月被浮云遮盖。抹掉尘土，才能使明镜重现光彩。驱除浮云，才能见到澄静如水的月光，才能见到皎洁的明月。真心与妄心之间，并非二心，都是一颗心。只是当心被邪思杂念笼罩时，真心便不能显现。驱散杂念，真心才能显露出来。妄念虽然不可能被完全消灭，但是可以控制减少。时常反省自身，使自己身上的喧嚣浮躁与心中的邪思杂念都能被控制减少。</p>
<p>列宁在少年的时候，养成一个习惯，每天晚上在睡觉之前，利用这段时间思考自己这一天的所作所为。经过反复思考，他发现有些事情是值得做的，有些事情是不值得做的。他还发现自己做的有些事情令他现在想起来感觉惭愧。经过这样的反省，他对于自己要做什么样的事情，哪些事情不能做，都有了一个明确的认识。这样就为自己的生活设立了目标。我们也不妨利用入睡前这段时间来思考一下，自己白天做的事情中哪些事情是积极有意义的，还有哪些事情是没有价值浪费生命的。还可以想一想自己的人生追求是什么，倾听自己的内心，发现真正的自我。对于青少年来说，这样做尤其有意义。因为青少年的身心还处于成长发育的过程中，世界观、人生观、价值观正处在形成培养过程中，这个时候多反省自身，发现自己真正的本性，保持真我，对于青少年健康成长，将来成为有用的人才，具有积极促进作用。对于成熟的成年人来说，这样做也有意义。时常观心反省，能够使我们的真心不被遮盖。社会就像是一个大染缸，处在社会中时间久了难免会使我们身上落满浮尘。时常静心反省一番，能使我们抖落身上的灰尘，发现真实的自我，并且保持真实的自我，这样生活也能过得更为轻松。</p>
<p>降客伸正气，消妄现真心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>矜高倨傲①，无非客气。降伏得客气②下，而后正气③伸；情欲意识，尽属妄心。消杀得妄心④尽，而后真心现。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①矜高倨傲：矜持傲慢，自夸自大。</p>
<p>②客气：虚夸浮泛，言行虚矫。也指与正气相对的、出自于人的血气。</p>
<p>③正气：出自于人的真心本性。</p>
<p>④妄心：妄，虚幻不实。妄心是佛家语，指人的本性被幻象蒙蔽。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>骄矜傲慢，自高自大，这不是出自于人的真心，而是受出自于血气、浮夸不实的客气影响。只有消除客气，人的正气才能够伸展出现。各种情欲邪念，都属于虚幻不真实的妄心。消除虚幻不实的妄心，人的真诚善良的真心才会显现出来。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人们的身体就好比是一个小宇宙，自成一个小天地。支配我们身体的是正气，这种正气正大光明；迷惑我们身体的是客气，这种客气虚幻不真诚。人们本有真心，只是妄心遮盖真心时，真心不能显现出来，因此只有消除妄心才能见到真心。对于学习求知而言，浮夸不诚的客气与虚幻不实的妄心都是障碍。学习要想取得进步，就需要把客气与妄心消除干净。如果稍稍取得一点成绩，就开始骄傲自夸，那么便可能固步自封，很难取得大成就了。俗话说“山外有山，人外有人”，学习是没有止境的，骄傲浮夸是学习路上的绊脚石。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是唐代大诗人李白，他在小的时候并不喜欢学习，非常贪玩。有一天小李白又从学堂里跑了出来，外面山清水秀，景色十分优美。小李白感觉到自由自在，玩得非常高兴。他东游西逛，走到一条河边，看到一位老太太在河边磨一根很粗的铁棒。小李白非常不理解，他不明白老太太为什么要磨这根铁棒。老太太告诉他，她要把这根铁棒磨成针。听到老太太说要把铁棒磨成针，小李白感到非常吃惊，他仔细看了下那根铁棒，那铁棒可是挺粗啊。他心想这么粗的一个铁棒磨成一根针，那真是太困难了。老太太仿佛看透了小李白的心思，她说：“把一根铁棒磨成针确实不容易，可我天天磨，总有一天能把这根铁棒磨成绣花针。”老太太自信的话语，使小李白很受触动。从那以后，他在学习上比从前用功多了。</p>
<p>在学习中，只有脚踏实地、踏踏实实用功，才能取得进步。如果三心二意、骄傲浮夸，既不能吃苦耐劳又不能谦虚谨慎，是无法在学习中取得进步的。对迷惑身心、诱使自己无法专心学习的各种邪思杂念，学习者需要保持警惕，时时清除，时刻保持清醒头脑，以理智的态度认真学习求知，长期坚持下去必能取得一定收获。</p>

<p>处世篇</p>
<p>随着社会的快速发展，人们所处的人事环境、物质环境也在急速变化中，面对这复杂多变的环境，我们不禁要喟叹，现在不仅做事难，做人更难。随着物质生活水平的逐年提高，现代社会人与人之间的关系变得如何呢？是近了？还是远了？工作中遇到不公正的事情，在生活中受到不平等的待遇，我们应该保持一种什么样的心态呢？</p>
<p>这是每一个人都必须面对的问题。那么，面对身边的人，我们应掌握一种什么样的原则？在纷繁复杂的社会环境中，我们应怎样维护一个良好的处世环境，保持一个良好的人际关系？</p>
<p>孟子说：“尊重你的道德，喜欢你的礼仪，就可以畅然自得了。所以，士人贫贱时也是行为不失礼，思谋不失义的。得了富贵之后，也不远离他的道德。贫贱而不失其礼义，所以寒士能够长存世间不失为士；富贵时而不远离道德，百姓便不至于失望。古时人得志，便有恩泽加惠于百姓；不得志，那就修养自己一身的品行，表现于世人。穷则独善其身，达则兼善天下。”</p>
<p>这是一种豁达的处世之道，也是为人之道。今天我们要能立足于社会，不妨跨越时光，向洪应明先生讨一知半解，参悟与人和睦相处，待人接物的学问。</p>
<p>操存有真宰，应用有圆机</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>操存①要有真宰，无真宰②则遇事便倒，何以植顶天立地之砥柱？应用要有圆机③，无圆机则触物有碍，何以成旋乾转坤之经纶④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①操存：操守，心志。</p>
<p>②真宰：主宰。</p>
<p>③圆机：圆通机变。</p>
<p>④经纶：筹划处理国家大事。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人的操守与心志要有一个主宰，假如没有主宰，遇到事情就会没有主见、随风倒。这样怎么能把自己培植成顶天立地的国家栋梁呢？做事情要圆通机变，假如不圆通灵活，那么处理事情就会遇到阻碍，这样怎么能使自己成为扭转乾坤、治理国家的人才呢。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>为人处世，需要有自己的原则。如果一个人没有原则，那就很容易像墙头草那样，随风而倒。一个人如果没有最基本的原则，那么也不可能担负起顶天立地的重大责任。这样也好，那样也可以，大家说好就是好，唯唯诺诺没有主见，这样的人成就不了大事。坚持原则同时还需要圆通机变，如果只懂得坚持原则不懂得遇事圆通机变，那么处理事情就会僵化，很难把事情处理得非常圆满。中国历史上有许多名臣良相，其中有很多人都能做到在坚持原则的基础上圆通机变处理事情。</p>
<p>仕女图</p>
<p>清朝中兴时期有四大名臣，胡林翼是其中一位。这位胡林翼就非常了解圆通的重要。当时胡林翼在湖北任军门提督，在他上面还有一个叫官文的官。官文虽然办事能力不见得出色，却很得朝廷信任。胡林翼深知与官文保持良好关系的重要。有一天官文派人送请帖给胡林翼，说是要给夫人过寿。胡林翼不能怠慢，精心准备了礼物前去官府祝寿。等到了官家大门口，却发现有不少官员很不高兴，一甩袖子走了。胡林翼找人一问，这才知道原来官文是给他姨太太过寿，不是给他大夫人过寿。过寿的这个姨太太很得官文宠爱，但是姨太太的地位毕竟很低下，所以许多官员觉得官文此举很不妥当，让大家觉得很难堪。当时胡林翼的地位以及声望都不低，他完全也可以一甩袖子走人。但是胡林翼没有走人，他进官府拜寿，献上礼物，在酒席间还提出一个建议。胡林翼建议由自己的母亲认这位姨太太为干女儿。胡林翼的母亲由于一直没有女儿，所以很希望能有一个女儿。胡林翼的这个提议，使得官文与姨太太非常高兴。因为以胡林翼的地位以及声望来说，姨太太认了胡家老太太为干妈，那是大大提高身份的事情。于是第二天，姨太太就到胡家拜见胡林翼母亲，正式结为亲戚。从那以后，官文和胡林翼相处融洽，胡林翼做事情比从前顺利很多。</p>
<p>人不轻喜怒，物不重爱憎</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>士君子之涉世，为人不可轻①为喜怒，喜怒轻，则心腹肝胆皆为人所窥②；于物不可重为爱憎，爱憎重，则意气精神悉为物所制。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①轻：轻易。</p>
<p>②窥：看，偷看。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>君子为人处世，不能轻易对别人表露自己欢喜与愤怒的感情。如果轻易表示自己欢喜与愤怒的感情，自己的内心世界就会被别人看清楚；对于各种事物来说，不能过于喜欢或者讨厌，如果过于喜欢或憎恶某种事物，那么自己的精神意志就都被这种事物所制约。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>为人处世，不可以轻易地表示自己的感情。轻易发火或者高兴，自己的内心世界就会被别人看透。如果对方是与你没有利害关系的人，那么还没有什么大影响。假如对方是你的竞争对手，那么轻易被对方看穿，也就意味着你可能会轻易被对方打败。对于各种事物，不要过分喜欢或者憎恶。如果过于在意某种事物，那么这种事物就能牵制人。如果一个人极其厌恶蛇这种生物，那么这个人就受到蛇的牵制，蛇就是这个人的死穴。如果一个人极其喜欢抽烟喝酒，那么烟酒就是这个人的死穴，烟酒就能制约这个人。身为平凡百姓，轻易喜怒，过分厌恶喜欢某物，影响个人，牵涉面还不大。但是假如身处重要位置，手中掌握重要权力，这个时候就得多注意自己的言行举止。切不可轻易喜怒，也不可轻易使他人掌握自己的喜好。</p>
<p>美国通用汽车公司曾经有一位总裁叫斯隆，他任总裁期间，通用汽车公司发展良好。年轻时候的斯隆爱好广泛，喜欢结交朋友，但是当他担任公司总裁以来，却把自己孤立起来，不与同事交朋友，从不在公开场合下谈论自己的家庭。在别人介绍他的文章中，看不到关于他的家人以及对他喜好的描述。别人不知道他喜欢什么，他在别人眼中是一个专业而标准的经理人，工作一丝不苟，严厉不讲情面。其实生活中的斯隆是一个喜欢交朋友的人，任何人都不会喜欢孤独，斯隆之所以在公司里不交朋友，不与他人走得太近，是出于工作方面的考虑。与自己的同事走得近，在管理公司，作出人事决策时难免会受到影响。和某位同事关系好，难免会有偏袒他的心理，所以为了工作斯隆不在公司里交朋友。别人不了解斯隆的喜好，也就无法投其所好，这样也就避免为了讨得上司喜欢而隐藏真实自我现象的出现。身为普通人可以有自己的爱好，也可以毫不掩饰自己的情感。但是身处重要位置，手中掌握权力，那就不能轻易喜怒，也不能有自己的嗜好。如果有戒不了的嗜好，那就把它隐藏起来，不要让别人知道。</p>
<p>玩世防射影，欺人恐照胆</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>倚高才而玩世①，背后须防射影之虫②；饰厚貌③以欺人，面前恐有照胆之镜④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①玩世：以嬉戏玩耍的态度处世。</p>
<p>②射影之虫：蜮，也叫射工。古代传说中的一种虫，在水中听到人声，就吹气激起水或含沙射人和人的影子。被射中的人便发疮，被射中影子者也得病。用来比喻阴险卑鄙的小人。</p>
<p>③厚貌：老实忠厚的样子。</p>
<p>④照胆之镜：传说汉高祖刘邦在咸阳宫中，见一块方镜，此镜能照见人的五脏，女子有邪心者，则胆张心动。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>依仗着自己出众的才干，以嬉戏轻蔑的态度处世，需要防备背后有小人诋毁中伤；假装忠厚老实以此来欺骗别人，面前恐怕会有照出人肝胆的镜子。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>自恃才高，以游戏人间的态度对待生活，以嬉戏玩耍的态度对待世事，恐怕会惹来祸害。三国时候的才子祢衡，才华横溢，高傲狂放，做事情随心所欲、狂放不羁。他来到许都，与孔融、杨修结为朋友。三个人感情很好，因为都是才学出众的才子，都为对方的才华折服，很谈得来。孔融已经四十多岁，祢衡才二十来岁，孔融把祢衡引荐给曹操。曹操想见祢衡，但是祢衡向来狂放不羁，称自己病了，不肯前去见曹操。祢衡还经常说一些肆无忌惮的话，惹得曹操很是不高兴。曹操虽然对祢衡心怀不满，但是知道祢衡非常有才，因此不打算杀死他。曹操听说祢衡善于击鼓，就召祢衡为大家击鼓娱乐。曹操大会宾客，等着祢衡击鼓，结果祢衡脱光了衣服羞辱曹操。</p>
<p>孔融拜见曹操，说祢衡有狂疾，现在他打算亲自登门道歉。曹操一听这话，非常高兴。结果祢衡衣冠不整，坐在大营门前，狂性复发，以杖捶地骂人。曹操自己不想留有杀名士的名声，于是把祢衡送到刘表那里。刘表听说过祢衡的才名，对待祢衡十分有礼恭敬，有关文章材料都请祢衡过目裁定。可是祢衡在刘表这里，依然是狂傲不羁，不久就得罪了刘表。刘表不能容忍祢衡，却也不愿意落下杀名士的名声，于是他把祢衡送到黄祖那里。黄祖性情急躁，最初见到祢衡，对祢衡也十分看重。祢衡狂傲的脾气依然如故，有一次出言不逊顶撞了黄祖，黄祖大怒之下就杀了祢衡。祢衡才华虽然出众，才干也强过众人，可是他狂傲不羁的个性却使别人不能容忍他，最终为他带来了杀身之祸。</p>
<p>假装一副忠厚老实的样子，以此来欺骗别人，要小心自己面前出现能照见人肝胆的镜子。俗话说“路遥知马力，日久见人心”，一个人可能在短时间内欺骗别人，却不可能一直欺骗别人。总有一天，其伪善的面目会被揭穿。所以与其对别人使用骗术，不如坦诚待人。</p>
<p>是非不迁就，利害少分明</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>当是非邪正之交，不可少①迁就，少迁就则失从违之正②；值利害得失之会，不可太分明，太分明则起趋避之私③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①少：稍微。</p>
<p>②从违之正：顺从或违反的标准。</p>
<p>③趋避之私：靠近或躲开的私心。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当人们处在区分是与非、正与邪的关键时刻，不能有丝毫的迁就。稍微有一点迁就，就会使人失去顺从还是违抗的标准；当人们处在利与害、得与失冲突的关键时刻，不能把利害得失区分得过于明确，过于明确的话会使人产生接近或者躲避的私心。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在处于是与非、正与邪相交锋的时刻，一定要有明确的态度，坚持自己的原则，不能有一丝一毫的迁就退让。如果在大是大非面前，没有自己的坚定原则，人云亦云，就像墙头草随风倒一样，不仅会使别人看轻，自己也失去了生存的目标。有一个童话故事，说的是两群鸟打架，第一个回合是甲队大胜，乙队被打得落荒而逃。甲队得胜归来，异常得意，大家举办庆功会，饮酒作乐。这时候大家看到一只猫头鹰很面生，就问这只猫头鹰是不是敌人派来的奸细。猫头鹰急忙表明自己的立场，说自己决心和甲队并肩作战。甲队众鸟热情欢迎猫头鹰，带着猫头鹰一起饮酒庆贺。没过多久，乙队众鸟卷土重来，一雪前耻，打败了甲队。这个时候猫头鹰赶忙向乙队表明忠心，说自己愿意跟着乙队。乙队众鸟接纳了猫头鹰，带着猫头鹰一同欢庆。过了一段时间之后，甲队众鸟经过养精蓄锐，又杀了回来，一举打败乙队。猫头鹰急忙又跑到甲队，说自己是甲队的鸟，结果被甲队众鸟赶了出来。猫头鹰无家可归，又去投靠乙队众鸟，结果又被乙队众鸟赶了出来。猫头鹰因此羞愧难当，从此以后只好躲在夜里活动。</p>
<p>这个童话故事说明，做事情一定要坚持原则，不能看到哪里有利益，就奔到哪里去。遇到涉及个人利益得失的问题时，如果对于利益得失过于明确，往往容易使人产生趋利避害的想法。这样一来，不利于处理事情，不利于很好地解决问题。所以涉及到自己的利益得失问题，不能完全不知情，也不可以分得过于明确。</p>
<p>宁风霜自挟，毋鱼鸟亲人</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>苍蝇附骥①，捷则捷矣，难避处后之羞②；茑萝③依松，高则高矣，未免仰攀之耻④。所以君子宁以风霜自挟⑤，毋为鱼鸟亲人⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①苍蝇附骥：比喻依附先辈或名人得以成名。骥，好马。</p>
<p>②处后之羞：跟在别人后面、从属于人的耻辱。</p>
<p>③茑萝：两种缠绕依附在别的物体上生长的蔓生植物。</p>
<p>④仰攀之耻：向上攀援、看人脸色的耻辱。</p>
<p>⑤风霜自挟：形容严肃冷峻。</p>
<p>⑥鱼鸟亲人：鱼鸟因为受到人的喂养而和人亲近。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>苍蝇落在骏马身上，跟着骏马飞驰。快确实是快，却难以逃避跟在别人后面、依附于人的羞耻；茑和萝缠绕依附在松树身上生长，高确实是高了，却不能避免攀附他人的耻辱。所以君子宁可严肃冷峻地守着自己清高的节操，也不会学鱼和鸟那样靠人喂养、与人亲近。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>唐朝武则天当政的时候，来俊臣得到武则天信任，一时之间势力很大。朝廷官员们对他又怕又恨。上林令侯敏小心侍奉他，侯敏的妻子劝侯敏说：“来俊臣乃是国贼，他得意不了多久的，一旦他出了事，跟着他的人会首先遭殃，你要对他敬而远之。”侯敏听从妻子劝告，从此渐渐远离来俊臣。后来，来俊臣果然失势，被朝廷问罪杀死，他的党羽也都没有好下场。侯敏因为早疏远来俊臣，所以没有被问罪，幸免于难。侯敏的妻子很有见识，及早认识到攀附权势不会有好下场。真正自立自强的人，是不会想到去依附他人。依靠着别人过日子，永远都不可能自立自强。</p>
<p>清闷阁墨竹图</p>
<p>法国文坛上，大仲马与小仲马是父子关系，两个人都非常有名。大仲马曾经写出《基督山伯爵》这样的名著，儿子小仲马也不甘落后，写出了《茶花女》。小仲马没有成名之前，爱好写作。他写好书稿，投寄到出版社。有几家出版社都给了他不予釆用的通知。有一家出版社的一位编辑接到他的书稿，仔细阅读之后，觉得有出版价值。于是这位编辑找到小仲马，和他讨论书稿事情。这位编辑认识大仲马，当时大仲马在法国文坛已经非常有名。编辑发现小仲马的真实姓名后，就问小仲马和大仲马是什么关系。小仲马说自己和大仲马没有什么关系。后来这位编辑见到大仲马之后，就问他是不是认识小仲马，大仲马告诉编辑小仲马是自己的儿子。大仲马看到儿子小仲马经常被退稿，就和小仲马说如果你告诉大家我是你的父亲，你的稿子就很容易被采用了。小仲马不听从父亲的建议，他每次投稿的时候都避免使用真名，他说要凭自己的能力成名，而不是依靠自己的父亲。我们在处世时能够做到自强自立，不攀附依靠他人，通过自己努力取得的成功，滋味会更加醇厚。</p>

<p>好丑心太明，则物不契①；贤愚心太明，则人不亲。士君子须是内精明而外浑厚，使好丑两得其平，贤愚共受其益，才是生成的德量②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①契：契合，投合。</p>
<p>②生成的德量：天生的美德与气量。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>区分事物好与坏的心思过于鲜明，那么就不容易与事物相投合；评价人贤良与愚蠢的心思过于分明，那么就不容易与人亲近。真正有德行的人应该是内心精明敏捷而外表浑厚纯朴，这样使得好与坏保持平衡，贤良与愚蠢都能受益，这才是天生的美德与气量。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人们向往完美，现实世界却并不是完美的世界。万事万物都各有其特点，有其自身运动规律。世间万物不是为人类而存在的，因此人们以自己的价值标准去判断万事万物，万物都有这样或那样的不符合人心意的地方。如果我们想与世间万物和谐相处，那就不能对它们过于挑剔。俗话说“金无足赤，人无完人”，每一个人都会有这样或者那样的缺点。与别人交往，贤良与愚蠢的区分过于明显，就不容易交到好朋友，而且还容易给别人留下难以亲近的印象。所以君子为人处世，心中精明，外表浑厚纯朴，待人宽容大度。</p>
<p>唐朝郭子仪，为朝廷立下大功，但是他从不骄傲自矜。朝廷每次封赏他，他都谦虚礼让。权臣鱼朝恩忌恨他。有一次，郭子仪祖坟被毁坏，有人说这是鱼朝恩私下派人做的。这时候正赶上郭子仪从外镇回来，大家担心会有一场大风波，恐怕郭子仪不肯善罢甘休。郭子仪见皇帝，皇帝便安慰他，郭子仪却说：“我常带兵打仗，士兵不免有毁坏老百姓坟墓的，我没有管理好，如今果然遭到天谴，这不是人力能够防备的。”郭子仪如此大度，令人折服。他在边镇时，曾经向朝廷推荐人才，可是朝廷没有采用他的推荐。他的手下说朝廷这样做，太不顾及郭子仪的颜面，郭子仪却说：“这是好事，这恰恰证明了朝廷不疑惧我，如果朝廷对我产生怀疑和恐惧因而每件事都听从我的建议，那才是祸事啊。”郭子仪一直活到八十五岁，子孙满堂，富贵而高寿，令人羡慕。他忠于唐王朝，建立丰硕功绩，从不居功自傲。他心胸宽阔、能够包容，以有如大海一般的心胸化解、消除争端，因此多福多寿。</p>
<p>念头持到底，小事不松弛</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>遇大事矜持①者，小事必纵弛②；气处明庭检饬③者，暗室必放逸④。君子则一个念头持到底，自然临小事如临大敌，坐密室若坐通衢⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①矜持：局促，拘束。</p>
<p>②纵弛：放松，懈怠。</p>
<p>③检饬：检点，约束自己。</p>
<p>④放逸：放纵。</p>
<p>⑤通衢：四通八达的道路。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>遇到大事局促小心的人，在遇到小事的时候必然会松弛懈怠；在大庭广众之下检点约束自己的人，在别人看不到的隐秘地方必然会放纵、没有规矩。君子则是一个念头坚持到底，始终如一。自然就会在遇到小事的时候也如临大敌，坐在没有别人的密室中也像坐在四通八达的大路上一样。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>君子遇到大事小事都不会松弛懈怠，在有人监督的情况下与没有人监督的时候君子的表现始终如一，始终严格要求自己。宋真宗时，皇帝要前往澶州鼓舞士气，临行之前，赐给向敏中一封密诏，把西部边疆的事情都托付给向敏中，允许他相机行事。向敏中得到密诏就藏了起来，和从前一样处理政事。这时候正好赶上要举行大傩会驱邪，有人向他报告说有人打算趁此机会作乱。向敏中就秘密指派士兵穿戴好盔甲，埋伏在廊下的幕布中。第二天，向敏中与宾客、幕僚、军士饮酒为乐，共同观赏傩舞。表演者先是在中门外表演，接着又走上台阶来，向敏中挥手，埋伏在幕布中的士兵一跃而出，把这些表演者全部擒获。搜查后，发现他们身上都藏着兵器。向敏中当即命令把这些人处死，又将他们的尸体埋掉，命人用灰沙打扫庭院，之后照旧举行宴会。</p>
<p>宋真宗皇帝在澶渊，听说雍王得重病，就命令丞相王旦马上赶回京城，代理京都事务。王旦一路飞奔，赶回京城，直接进了宫中，命令身边的人不得把消息泄漏出去。后来皇上回宫，王旦家人都去迎接真宗，忽然听见身后有车马和人的吆喝声。大家回头一看，竟然是王旦，家人都大吃一惊，不知道王旦是什么时候回到京城的。</p>
<p>向敏中与王旦遇到大事镇静自若，游刃有余地处理事情，这有赖于平时的修养之功。如果平时对自己不加约束，遇到事情消极懈怠处理，当遇到大事情的时候就不可能做到镇定自若，定然会乱了手脚，不知如何是好。所以我们最好能够做到在遇到小事情的时候也不放松，在人前人后都能严格要求约束自己。</p>
<p>无背后之毁，无久处之厌</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>使人有面前之誉①，不若使其无背后之毁②；使人有乍交之欢，不若使其无久处之厌。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①誉：赞扬，赞美。</p>
<p>②毁：毁谤，说别人的坏话。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>使别人当面赞美你，不如使别人不在背后诋毁中伤你；使别人感到与你初次相交很愉快，不如使别人感到和你长久相处也不会产生厌恶的感觉。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>想获得别人的当面赞美，还不如使别人不在背后诋毁中伤更好。因为当面奉承赞美，未必是出自于真心。《战国策》中有一篇《邹忌讽齐王纳谏》，说的是邹忌劝说君主纳谏，广开言路，使得齐国变得强大。邹忌身高八尺多，容貌俊美。有一天早上穿衣服，他对着镜子看着自己的样貌，问妻子说：“我和城北徐公比，谁的容貌更美呢？”他的妻子回答说：“您比他美多了，徐公怎么能比得上您呢？”城北徐公的容貌俊美，这在齐国广为流传。邹忌听了妻子的话还是有些不自信，于是又问自己的妾说：“我和城北徐公比，谁的容貌更美呢？”妾回答说：“当然是您更美，徐公怎么能比得上您呢？”有客人来拜访邹忌，邹忌和客人谈了一会，就问客人说：“我和城北徐公比，谁的容貌更美呢？”客人回答说：“徐公不如您美。”后来，徐公来拜访邹忌，邹忌仔细端详徐公，觉得自己不如对方美。邹忌对着镜子照，感觉自己的容貌远远比不上徐公。邹忌仔细思量了一番，得出结论说：“我的妻子说我美，是因为她偏爱我；我的妾说我美，是因为她畏惧我；客人说我美，是因为他有求于我。”</p>
<p>邹忌上朝拜见齐威王，说：“我知道自己不如徐公美，我的妻子偏爱我，我的妾畏惧我，我的客人有求于我，于是他们都说我比徐公美。如今齐国土地千里，一百二十座城池，妃嫔侍从都偏爱您，朝廷大臣都惧怕您，国内百姓都有事求您。这样看来，大王您受到的蒙蔽就太深了。”齐威王听取了邹忌的劝诫，广开进谏之路，使得齐国变得更为强大。由此可见，别人当面赞美并非一定可靠，要看赞美是否出自对方的真心。和别人交往的时候，初次相逢就一见如故，亲密非常，不如长久和对方相处下来而互相不生厌恶。</p>
<p>己之欲须忍，人之情当恕</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>己之情欲①不可纵，当用逆②之之法以制之，其道只在一“忍”字；人之情欲不可拂，当用顺之之法以调之，其道只在一“恕③”字。今人皆“恕”以适己，而“忍”以制人，毋乃不可乎？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①情欲：欲望。</p>
<p>②逆：克制。</p>
<p>③恕：宽恕。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>自己的欲望不能放纵，应当用克制的方法控制自己的欲望，关键就在一个“忍”字；他人的欲望不可以违背，应当用顺应它的方法调理，关键就在一个“恕”字。可是如今的人都以宽容的态度对待自己，却用克制欲望要求别人，这恐怕不行吧！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>对待自己要严格，对待别人要宽容。如果不这样做，对自己对别人都没有好处。对自己要求不高，总是以宽容的态度对待自己，自己无法获得进步，最终害了自己；对别人要求很高，丝毫不能容忍他人的过失，这样不利于别人进步。因为只有在不断艰苦摸索中取得的成功，才能获得较长久的寿命，而不允许别人犯错误，不能原谅别人的一时过失，那么别人也许会裹足不前，虽然不会犯错误，却也无法取得进步。</p>
<p>《东周列国志》上有这样一个故事：楚庄王在一次平定叛乱后很高兴，大宴群臣。君臣开怀痛饮，兴致很高，一直喝到太阳下山，天渐渐黑下来。楚庄王叫人把灯烛点上，挑灯夜宴继续吃喝。楚庄王一高兴便叫自己最宠爱的妃子们出来倒酒。其中有一位姓许的妃子最为美貌，席上大臣们心里羡慕许妃这样漂亮，可是也不敢太过明显盯着她看，毕竟是大王的妃子。许妃为文臣武将们倒酒，忽然一阵风吹过，把屋里的灯烛都吹灭了。这时候有一个人偷偷拉扯许妃的衣角，许妃没有声张，扯下了那人帽子上的带子，回到楚庄王身边，把这一切悄悄告诉楚庄王。并且说点亮灯烛，看到谁的帽子上没有帽缨，便找出了那个胆大妄为的人。楚庄王听了之后，却命令不要点灯烛，并且说今天我们大家要痛快喝，大家不要拘礼，把帽缨都取下。等到大家把帽缨都取下来了，楚庄王这才让人点灯。</p>
<p>后来楚庄王与郑国开战，一员战将拼死护着楚庄王，所向无敌，一直杀到郑国国都。得胜归来，楚庄王论功行赏，那员护着他的战将功劳很大，楚庄王打算好好奖赏他。但是这名战将却跪下说自己不要赏赐，并说希望楚庄王原谅他，原来当年在宴会上对许妃无礼的人就是他。他酒后一时失礼，事后后悔不迭，幸亏楚庄王不追究。他对楚庄王心怀感激，一直想找机会报答。楚庄王听了，大为感慨，便把许妃赏赐给他做妻子。宽恕他人一时过错，多施恩，少结怨仇，自己也会收到回报。</p>
<p>难亲胜疏终，守拙胜巧持</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>与人①者，与其易疏②于终，不若难亲于始；御事③者，与其巧持于后，不若拙守于前。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①与人：和别人交往。</p>
<p>②疏：疏远。</p>
<p>③御事：处理事情。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>和别人交往的时候，与其到最后与对方关系疏远，还不如一开始就不轻易和对方亲近结交；处理事情的时候，与其到最后使用机巧奸诈，还不如一开始就表现笨拙。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>和别人交往，与其到最后落得一个不欢而散的结局，还不如从一开始就不轻易和别人亲近。在生活中，我们常常听到这样的事情，两个人最初关系非常好，亲如一家人，后来翻脸绝交，互相指责对方的短处。这样的事情实在是令人感叹，与其后来怒目以对，那还不如从一开始就保持距离的好。处理事情，与其到最后使用技巧奸诈的手段，那还不如从一开始就不参与这件事情。有时候勇于承认自己的不足，不仅不可耻，反而很可敬。</p>
<p>古龙曾经说过：“你最可怕的敌人，就是你身边最亲密的朋友。”朋友也分很多种，在选择朋友的时候需要慎重，这样就不至于到最后落得最亲密的朋友变成最大的敌人。有这样一个故事，说的是有一个女人，她生活中各个方面都美满如意。丈夫工作稳定，积极上进，又善待妻子。孩子们都乖巧听话，优秀出众，不用父母费心。这个女人在家当了一段时间的家庭主妇之后，由于孩子们都已经上学，她在家中无事可做，于是报名参加了一个写作培训班。她在写作班中很受欢迎，她写的一些散文在几家知名刊物上发表。为此丈夫很为她高兴，她自己也非常高兴，于是决定在家里举行一个聚会，请朋友们来庆祝一下。请的这些朋友，都是经过仔细挑选的，关系一直比较亲密。她准备了糕点茶水，从外面餐馆叫外卖送来各式菜肴。宾主之间相谈甚欢，大家都很开心。就在这个时候，有人表示羡慕这个女人，说她生活中几乎没有什么不满意的地方了。女主人听了这话，想了一下之后说不是这样的，自己生活中也有很多烦恼。于是女主人讲起了一件事情，最近一段时间，她被骚扰电话所困扰，总是有人在深夜她睡意正浓的时候打电话过来。她接起电话，对方不是不讲话，就是把电话挂断。于是有人给她出主意说，不如装一个来电显示，这样对方再打电话过来就可以回拨过去骂他一顿，再不然还可以查一查究竟是谁总打骚扰电话。女主人认为这个主意很好，于是宣布她要安装来电显示。</p>
<p>又过了一段时间之后，女主人获得了一份令人羡慕的好工作，她准备再举行一个聚会庆祝自己获得新工作。她在筹划请哪些朋友的时候，突然想起一件事情，这个突然冒出来的想法令她不寒而栗。自从她家安装上来电显示之后，就再也没有骚扰电话了，也就是说从前那些骚扰电话正是那次聚会中的某一个朋友打来的。</p>
<p>灭处观功名，起处究困穷</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>功名富贵，直从灭处观究竟，则贪恋自轻；横逆①困穷，直从起处究由来，则怨尤②自息。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①横逆：横暴不顺利。</p>
<p>②怨尤：怨愤，责怪。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>功名富贵如果能从它们消失的地方探究原因，那么贪恋荣华富贵的念头自然会减轻；穷苦挫折如果能从它们产生的地方探究由来，那么怨愤不满的情绪自然会平息了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>功名富贵如果能从它们消失的地方探究原因，那么对于功名富贵的贪恋之心自然就会减轻了。纵观历史，无论是哪个朝代，拥有功名富贵的人都不能保持长久。功名富贵虽然好，拥有功名富贵虽然显赫得意，当失去功名富贵的时候也会格外凄凉。富贵得来虽然不容易，失去却非常容易。汉朝开国大功臣萧何在选择住宅基地的时候，必然会选择穷僻所在。他说：“后世贤，师吾俭；不贤，毋为势家所夺。”也就是说如果子孙后代贤良，那么就会像祖宗萧何一样节俭，如果子孙不贤良，必然保不住祖宗的产业，定然会被有势力的人家抢夺走。所以功名富贵没有固定的主人，今天归于某人之手，明天又可能被更强势有力的人夺走。如今社会虽然不讲功名富贵，但是对于权力金钱的追求却是同古人没有太大差别的。俗话说“人各有志”，每一个人都有权利选择自己想过的生活。追求金钱与权力也无可厚非，只是如果能以正当的手段追求，并且不沦为金钱与权力的奴隶，对社会有所贡献，能够真正创造一定的价值，这样得来的金钱与权力才能无愧于心，才能拥有较长时间。</p>
<p>孤屿鼓棹图</p>
<p>穷苦挫折，如果能从其来源处探究原因，这样怨天尤人的不满情绪自然会消失。有两个人到外地打工，他们在火车站遇到了，于是聊了起来。这时候旁边的人问他们准备去哪里。他们一个准备去北京，另外一个准备去上海。旁边这个人就说北京人非常热心，看到无家可归的人还会施舍给他们一些钱，超市里还有免费的糕点可以品尝。还说上海人非常精明，你不要想占他们一点便宜，就是在街上问路，他们还会收钱。准备去上海的这个人一听这话，立刻想改道去北京。而原准备去北京的这个人，却想去上海，他听说上海人从问路中都能赚钱，感到非常羡慕与佩服，想上海真是一个能赚钱的地方。于是这两个人就交换了车票。原来打算去上海的现在去了北京，原来本打算去北京的现在去了上海。过了几年之后，这两个人又在火车站相遇了。去了上海的那个人已经赚了一笔钱，日子过得不错。去了北京的那个人和当年比没有什么变化，日子依然过得不顺心。这个故事表明，人们在生活中境遇如何，有时候不能一味怨天尤人，自己也需要有积极进取的精神。</p>
<p>待人留恩礼，御事留才智</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>待人而留有余不尽之恩礼①，则可以维系无厌之人心；御事②而留有余不尽之才智，则可以提防不测之事变。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①恩礼：恩惠与礼遇。</p>
<p>②御事：处理事情。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>对待别人留有一定余地，不能把恩惠与礼遇一下子都给予对方，这样才可以维持住欲望无限的人心；处理事情留有一定的才能与智慧，这样可以防备意料之外的事情发生。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“人心不足蛇吞象”，人心是非常不容易满足的。所以对待他人，可以逐渐地给予恩礼。做事情需要留有一定才能与智慧，这样才不至于后继乏力。如果把自己所有的能力都使出来，遇到变故的时候，便不容易应对。</p>
<p>有这样一个童话故事，说的是金鱼和渔夫的故事。有一个渔夫在海边打鱼，当他捞上来一条金鱼的时候，金鱼开口说话，请求渔夫把它放了，并且说能满足渔夫的任何要求。渔夫是一个非常纯朴的人，他什么要求也没有提就放走了金鱼。当他回到家中，把这件事情告诉自己的妻子的时候，妻子骂他傻，并且逼着他去向金鱼要一个新木盆。渔夫无奈之中，只得来到海边，向金鱼要了一个新木盆。老太婆有了新木盆之后，并不满意，她又逼着渔夫去向金鱼要一所新房子。渔夫没有办法只好到海边呼唤金鱼，向金鱼要新房子。金鱼满足了他的要求。渔夫家有了新房子，但是老太婆更不满足了，说自己不愿意再做农妇，她要成为世袭的贵夫人。渔夫只得又走向海边，呼唤金鱼，说老太婆已经不再满足于做一个普通的农家妇，她要成为贵夫人。金鱼答应了渔夫的请求。渔夫回到家中，发现老太婆果然变成了贵夫人，穿金戴银，呼喝奴仆。老太婆要渔夫到马棚里去干活。</p>
<p>这样过了几天，老太婆又感到不满足了。她把渔夫找来，命令他去找金鱼，说自己不想再当贵夫人，想成为一个自由自在的女皇。渔夫没有办法，只得又走到海边，呼唤金鱼，说老太婆已经不再想当贵夫人，她想成为至高无上的女王。金鱼答应了渔夫的请求，说老太婆会成为女皇的。渔夫回到家中，发现自己的家已经成为皇宫，老太婆已经变成了女王，她喝着美酒，吃着各式精美的糕点，有威风神气的士兵保护着她。她对渔夫看都不看一眼，令人把他赶出去。过了一段时间之后，老太婆又派人把渔夫招来，说自己已经厌倦当女皇了，她要成为海上的女霸王，让金鱼来服侍自己。渔夫不敢不去，他来到海边，呼唤出金鱼，向金鱼表达了老太婆的愿望。这一次金鱼没有再满足他的要求，而是游到深海中去了。渔夫等了好久不见金鱼出现，只好回到家中。他发现老太婆又变成了从前那个贫穷的农妇。渔夫妻子贪得无厌，最终什么都没有得到。</p>
<p>仇边弩易避，恩里戈难防</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>仇边之弩①易避，而恩里之戈②难防；苦时之坎③易逃，而乐处之阱④难脱。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①弩：弓，一种靠机械力量发射箭的弓。</p>
<p>②戈：一种兵器。</p>
<p>③坎：坎坷。</p>
<p>④阱：陷阱，圈套。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>从敌人那里射过来的箭容易躲避，从朋友那里刺过来的戈难以防备；苦难时候的坎坷容易克服，而快乐地方的陷阱与危险却难以逃避。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在遇到危险的时候，我们的警惕性相应也会提高。因此对于从敌人那边射过来的箭，往往比从朋友中间刺出的戈更容易防备。在艰难闲苦的时候遇到挫折，往往还能克服，在快乐安逸的生活中遇到危险却难以应对。</p>
<p>春秋时期，晋国发生内乱，晋国的公子重耳逃亡在外，等待机会回国接替王位。逃亡在外的生活非常艰难，衣食不周，有时候还会遇到危险。重耳吃尽了苦头。当他逃亡到齐国的时候，齐桓公对他很好，以礼相待，送他宝马财物，并在宗室中挑选了一位容貌美丽的女子嫁给他。重耳从此在齐同安定下来，生活过得很是安逸快乐。他一住就是五年，完全没有走的意思。他每天和妻子姜氏饮酒为乐，生活过得闲适自在，往日的雄心大志也就放在一边了。跟随他的赵衰、子犯等人为此很是着急，他们商量着离开齐国的事情。当时他们在郊外的桑树下秘密商量事情，以为郊外无人，谁知道桑树上有采桑叶的女子，她们是侍奉姜氏的婢女，听到这事就回去告诉了姜氏。姜氏害怕走漏风声，为重耳惹来祸事，就把这些女子都杀死灭口。</p>
<p>姜氏劝重耳快快离开齐国，不要贪恋安逸的生活而忘了大事。重耳回答说：“人生安乐就好，为什么要管那么多事情。”姜氏苦苦相劝，重耳并不听从，到最后反而对姜氏发怒。姜氏看劝不动公子，也就作罢，假装高兴说自己劝重耳回国，其实是在试探他，如今公子坚决不肯回国，自己也就放心了。于是姜氏吩咐人们摆酒，说是要庆贺公子留在自己身边。重耳也高兴起来，与妻子对饮，喝得酩酊大醉，躺下不省人事。姜氏招来跟随重耳逃亡的众人，让他们把重耳用车拉走了。重耳最终回到晋国，成为晋国之君，使得晋国发展壮大，成就了霸业。重耳在遭遇艰难挫折的时候，能保持积极的斗志，但是在安逸舒适的生活中，却消磨了斗志，可见快乐安逸的生活其实隐藏着危险。我们需要在安逸舒适的生活中，保持积极的警惕性。</p>
<p>芳垢名不留，只元气浑然</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>膻秽①则蝇蚋②丛嘬③，芳馨则蜂蝶交侵④。故君子不作垢业⑤，亦不立芳名⑥；只是元气浑然，圭角⑦不露，便是持身涉世一安乐窝也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①膻秽：又臭又脏的东西。</p>
<p>②蝇蚋：苍蝇蚊子。</p>
<p>③丛嘬：聚在一起吮吸叮咬。</p>
<p>④交侵：争相侵犯，这里指争相采撷。</p>
<p>⑤垢业：做坏事。垢，污秽、脏东西。</p>
<p>⑥芳名：好名声。</p>
<p>⑦圭角：圭的锋芒有棱角，比喻人的言行怪异刻薄。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>苍蝇蚊子等聚集在一起叮咬腥臭的东西，蜜蜂蝴蝶等争相采撷芳香的花朵。所以君子既不做坏事，也不树立良好的名声，只是保持一团浑然本真，不露锋芒，这就是立身处世保持安稳的好方法。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>腥膻的东西会招引来苍蝇蚊子，芳香四溢又会吸引来蜜蜂蝴蝶。由此可见，无论是芳香还是腥臭都会给自己惹来麻烦。有句俗话说得好，“人怕出名猪怕壮”，名声在外，有时候会给自己带来无穷无尽的烦恼。要想不惹麻烦安稳度日，最好的方法就是既不树立良好的名声，也不去做坏事。安守本分，做好自己的事情，不去做有愧于良心的事情。多做善事，但是不必为自己树立名声，这样也许能获得意料之外的福分。</p>
<p>汉文帝的母亲薄太后的经历，正是体现了安守本分、锋芒不露终于获得了意料之外的福分。汉高祖刘邦妃嫔很多，薄姬并不得宠，只是非常幸运地生下一个儿子刘恒。刘邦最喜欢的是戚夫人，戚夫人所生的儿子赵王如意也最得刘邦宠爱。刘邦曾经一度想把吕后所生的太子废掉，改立戚夫人的儿子赵王为太子。由于张良为太子出谋划策，刘邦认为太子羽翼丰满难以撼动了，最终没有实行废立太子之事。吕后对戚夫人恨之入骨，等到刘邦死后，吕后立刻把后宫美人都幽禁起来。刘邦在世之时比较喜欢的美人，很多都被吕后抓起来杀死。吕后最恨戚夫人，她把戚夫人手脚砍断，狠狠折磨了一番处死。吕后又找机会暗害赵王如意。吕后所生的儿子刘盈继承皇位，也就是汉惠帝。惠帝喜欢弟弟赵王，他把赵王带在身边保护。可是有一次赵王没有跟在惠帝身边，终于被吕后害死。刘邦活着的时候，薄姬并不得宠，默默无闻，吕后也就没有害她，反而让她出宫去跟着自己的儿子代王也就是刘恒一起生活。薄姬锋芒不露，使得她保全了性命。后来惠帝和吕后都死了，朝中大臣们商议立新皇帝。有人建议立刘邦的大儿子刘肥，因为刘肥母亲家名声不好所以这个建议被否决。也有人主张立淮南王，也因为淮南王母亲家名声不好被否决。选到最后只有代王刘恒合适，他的母亲薄姬安守本分，没有坏名声。于是刘恒继承了皇位，薄姬成了皇太后。薄太后安守本分，既不做坏事，也不露锋芒，保全了自己，也成全了儿子刘恒。</p>
<p>宁刚方见惮，勿媚悦取容</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>落落者①，难合亦难分；欣欣者②，易亲亦易散。是以君子宁以刚方③见惮④，勿以媚悦取容。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①落落者：孤僻不合群、态度冷漠、不随便和别人交往的人。</p>
<p>②欣欣者：笑容满面、和颜悦色、容易和别人交往的人。</p>
<p>③刚方：严厉刚正。</p>
<p>④见惮：感到害怕。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>孤僻不合群的人，难以结交，一旦和别人交往成为朋友，又难以分离。对待别人和颜悦色、满面笑容的人，容易接交也容易断交。所以君子宁可因为严厉刚正使别人产生畏惧而不敢轻易接近自己，也不可以奉承取悦别人以求得亲近结交。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>不轻易与别人结交的人，如果和某一个人结为朋友，往往也不会轻易断交。对谁都亲善友爱的人，容易交到朋友，但是往往不容易交到真正的好朋友。与其满脸堆笑，表现出亲和友善的样子，处处讨好取悦别人，还不如与别人保持一定距离。俗话说“君子之交淡如水”，君子之间交往虽然不够甜蜜热闹，但是这种友谊却能保持长久。</p>
<p>汉武帝的时候，李陵与匈奴交战，战败之后投降匈奴。汉武帝听说这个消息之后，勃然大怒，把李陵的全家都处斩了。朝廷之中没有人敢为李陵说话，司马迁为李陵辩解几句，惹怒了汉武帝，司马迁因此招来宫刑之祸。司马迁可以说是李陵的朋友，但是实际上两个人的交往并不频繁。司马迁在《报任安书》中说：“夫仆与李陵俱居门下，素非相善也，趣舍异路，未尝衔杯酒接殷勤之欢。然仆观其为人自奇士，事亲孝，与士信，临财廉，取予义，分别有让，恭俭下人，常思奋不顾身以徇国家之急。其素所畜积也，仆以为有国士之风。”也就是说司马迁和李陵从前交往并不频繁，也并没有把酒言欢、殷勤相劝的事情。两家人住的也比较远，并不同路。司马迁之所以为李陵辩解，是因为司马迁认为李陵有国士之风，非常孝顺，有诚信，不贪财物，礼贤下士，当国家有事情的时候李陵能够奋不顾身保卫国家。李陵与司马迁的这种友谊，正是君子之交的体现。管仲与鲍叔牙的友谊也是如此，鲍叔牙信任管仲，当管仲遇到困难的时候，鲍叔牙总是支持管仲。管仲曾经感叹说：“生我者父母，知我者鲍子也！”这种互为知己的友谊是真正长久的友谊。我们在与别人交往的时候，既需要真诚和气对待别人，同时也需要对朋友有所选择。通过取悦讨好别人获得友谊，是得不偿失的事情。</p>

<p>廉洁是用来戒除贪婪的，我确实不贪婪，那又何必树立一个廉洁的名声，引来贪婪之人的嫉恨。谦让是用来戒除争斗的，我确实不好争斗，那又何必树立一个谦让的名声，招来凶暴之人的祸害。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>提倡清正廉洁是因为有人贪污枉法，如果我确实不贪污枉法，那么树立一个廉洁的名声其实是为自己招惹是非的做法。谦让是因为有人喜欢争斗，如果我确实不好争斗，也就没有必要为自己树立一个谦让不争的名声，谦让的名声有时候甚至会为自己招来凶暴之人的祸害。在生活中切实做到廉洁与谦让，但是却并不树立廉洁与谦让的好名声，这是坚持自己的良好品行，同时远避是非祸患的明智做法。</p>
<p>中国后唐名将郭崇韬很廉洁，但是他到洛阳后开始接受人们送的礼物。这时候他的家人与朋友开始劝诫他。郭崇韬回答说：“我兼任丞相和将军的职务，皇上赏赐无数，我的俸禄也有不少，我并不是缺钱。只不过现在送礼的这些人多是从前梁朝的旧将，都是和皇上有旧仇的人。如果我不接受他们的礼物，这样很容易使他们产生惊疑猜测，因此我接受礼物不过是安慰人心。”第二年，皇上在南郊祭祀，郭崇韬把自己收到的财物全部献给朝廷。郭崇韬收取礼物是为了安定人心，这个时候如果标榜自己廉洁，反而不能妥善处理事情，不能有效安定人心。郭崇韬收取礼物，又把礼物献给朝廷，这样既安定了人心，又保持了清正廉洁。</p>

<p>南唐皇帝曾经送了几万两银子给北宋大臣赵普。赵普把这件事情报告给宋太祖，宋太祖让他放心收下，并写感谢信给对方。等到南唐皇帝派人来拜见宋太祖时，宋太祖也如法炮制，秘密派人送给南唐使者白银。这使得南唐君臣为之感叹。从这些历史故事中，可以发现廉洁不应只注重名声，因为在实践中还需要灵活变通。在实践中，坚持以廉洁和谦让为处事原则，实际做到廉洁与谦让，根据现实情况灵活变通。如果被廉洁谦让等好名声所拖累，那么就不能有效处理事情。</p>
<p>勿欲人感恩，当为人除害</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>处世而欲人感恩，便为敛怨①之道；遇事而为人除害，即是导利②之机。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①敛怨：收敛、招致怨恨。</p>
<p>②导利：引导、收获利益。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>为人处世想着要得到别人的感激，这就是为自己聚敛怨恨的道路；遇到事情为别人消除祸患，这就是为自己引导、收获利益的机会。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>为人处世中，如果有能力帮助别人，那么就不要吝惜，多帮助别人也是为自己铺设道路。遇到別人有克服不了的困难时，主动帮助他人解决困难，这也是为自己多结善缘。在帮助他人的时候，最好不要心存希望，希望别人对自己感恩戴德。如果帮助了别人之后，希望别人感激自己，这就使得乐于助人的美好行为掺杂了杂质。希望别人感激自己，有时往往会惹来别人的怨恨。帮助別人需要付出，接受别人帮助的人也不会很轻松，他们难免有受人恩惠的不自在感，所以帮助别人的时候最好不要邀功请赏，希望被帮助的人感激自己。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是从前有位好心的财主，盖了一所大房子。他嘱咐工匠，特意把房子前面的屋檐建造得特别长。这样遇到雨雪天气，那些无家可归的人可以到屋檐下躲避雨雪。房子盖好之后，果然有很多人聚集在财主的屋檐下。他们大声交谈，聚在一起游戏，有的人还在屋檐下生火做饭，甚至还有人在此摆摊卖东西。财主受不了喧哗，和屋檐下的人争辩，也解决不了问题。后来一场风暴，使得财主的房屋被破坏。财主找人重修房子，这一次他要求屋檐建造得正常就可以，不需要再特意加长了。他拿出一些钱来，盖了一些小房子，收纳那些无处容身的人，并且时常煮粥救济那些饥饿的人。这样一来，很多人都说财主善良，不像从前很多人骂他仗着有钱欺负穷人。这个故事说明，帮助别人也需要注意方法，如果总是以要别人感激自己的态度去帮助别人，使别人时时产生一种仰人鼻息的耻辱感，那么就会为自己招来怨恨。</p>
<p>君子如介石，小人如脂膏</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>君子严如介石①，而畏其难亲，鲜不以明珠为怪物②，而起按剑之心；小人滑如脂膏，而喜其易合，鲜不以毒螫③为甘饴④而纵染指⑤之欲。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①介石：又硬又冰冷的石头。</p>
<p>②鲜不以明珠为怪物，而起按剑之心：《史记•邹阳传》：“臣闻明之珠，夜光之璧，以暗投人于道路，人无不按剑相眄者，何则？无因而至前也。”意思是说珍贵的明珠玉璧，人们由于不了解它们的真正价值，也会把它当作怪物而扔掉或销毁。鲜，少。</p>
<p>③毒螫：各种毒虫的毒刺。</p>
<p>④甘饴：甘甜的麦芽糖。</p>
<p>⑤染指：《左传》中记载，楚人献鼋给郑灵公，灵公召诸大夫共食。大夫子公来到，灵公却不分给他，于是“子公怒，染指于鼎，尝之而出”。本来是说用手指蘸鼎内的鼋羹，后来用以比喻瓜分非分的利益。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>有德行的正人君子像冰冷坚硬的石头一样严峻，使得人产生畏惧之感而难以与君子亲近，很少有人不把如明珠般的君子看作是怪物，从而产生拔剑刺杀的念头；没有德行的卑鄙小人像脂膏一般圆滑，人们喜欢他们容易接近，很少有人不把像毒虫一样带着毒针的卑鄙小人看成是甘甜的糖，从而产生想尝一尝的欲望。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有德行的君子，对自己要求严格，对自己的错误不姑息纵容，对别人的要求相应也比较严格。因此在与正人君子交往时，很容易使人产生畏惧的感觉，觉得君子难以接近、不好相处，有时甚至使人产生除掉君子的欲望。卑鄙小人往往比较容易接近，他们与人交往，圆滑灵活，甜言蜜语，容易使人产生好感。</p>
<p>唐玄宗时，任用李林甫为相。李林甫很得玄宗信任，他不喜欢读书，懂得音律，与爱好音乐的唐玄宗很有共同语言。李林甫长得白皙，非常善于修饰打扮，外表容易使人产生好感。他很会说话，经常和颜悦色地待人，甜言蜜语使得别人很愿意和他交往，以为他和蔼可亲。实际上他是一个口蜜腹剑的小人，嘴甜如蜜，心中装了一肚子的谋害别人的阴谋诡计。他辅佐皇上，不是以国家大事为重，而是常常揣摩玄宗心思，只想哄得玄宗高兴。他处处小心应对，处处令玄宗满意。他虽然没有真才实学，却善于经营，在皇宫中布下耳目，宫中有事他立刻知道。因此他能够揣摩出玄宗的心思，投玄宗所好，哄骗玄宗，深得玄宗的信任。同时的一位良相张九龄，才干突出、学识渊博、敢于直言。张九龄直言进谏，有时候难免有些言语令唐玄宗听着很不顺耳。正直可靠的张九龄敌不过圆滑嘴甜的李林甫，最后唐玄宗罢了张九龄任用李林甫为相。由此可见，我们在生活中需要对那些嘴甜如蜜的人保持一定距离。处处奉承别人的人，恐怕是有一定目的才这样做。那些刚直不阿的人，虽然给人非常严厉的感觉，却不会在背后害人。与君子相交，能使自己有所收获，与小人交往，不知何时就会被小人算计。所以我们需要多接近君子，不要因为他们非常严厉就对他们产生厌恶的感觉。</p>
<p>遇事须镇定，待人无欺隐</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>遇事只一味镇定从容，纵纷若乱丝，终当就绪①；待人无半毫矫伪欺隐，虽狡②如山鬼，亦自献诚。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①就绪：一切安排委当。</p>
<p>②狡：狡猾，狡诈。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>遇到事情只要一直保持镇定从容，即使事情复杂如一团乱丝，终究还是能处理妥当；对待他人没有丝毫虚伪狡诈，即使像山鬼那样狡诈的人，也会以坦诚对待你。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>遇到事情保持镇静从容，复杂的事情也能变得容易解决。如果自己先慌乱起来，必然无法很好地解决问题。对待别人，付出坦诚，那么最狡猾的人也会有所感动，从而以坦诚回报。</p>
<p>宋真宗时候，李允则举行酒宴犒赏将士，兵器库突然失火。李允则依旧饮酒作乐，并不惊慌失措。一会儿火就被扑灭了。李允则秘密派人拿着他的文书到瀛洲用茶叶箱运来武器铠甲，补全了库里的武器，军中没有一个人知道。事后，李允则解释说：“兵器库防火措施很严密，我刚举行宴会，那里就起了火，必然是内奸所为。如果我离开宴席去救火，正是中了这些人的奸谋。”</p>
<p>宋朝时，杜纮曾任郓州知州，这时有人在城墙角树了杆旗子，写了一些妖言惑众的话，意图制造事端，州民都震惊不已。不久，草料库白天失火，这正是妖言预料的事情之一，人民更加恐惧。有人建议应该搜查全城。杜纮笑着说：“奸计正在于此，他们希望我大肆搜查，借着这个机会他们可以发动事变，怎么可以中计呢？他们成不了什么事的。”过了不久，捕获盗贼，原来正是造乱的奸民，于是把他们处死。</p>
<p>宋英宗的时候，苏颂陪契丹使者回国，住在恩州。当晚驿站起火，手下人请他出去避火，苏颂不答应。州兵要进来救火，苏颂也不答应。他命令守卫驿站的士兵去把火扑灭。刚起火的时候，恩州郡里人心不定，纷纷议论，说是契丹使者发生哗变，州兵也正想借这个挑起事端。幸亏苏颂镇静自若，稳如泰山，把事情压了下去。</p>
<p>文彦博喜欢游玩饮酒，有一天大雪会客，夜深还不停止。跟随他的士兵非常不满意，就拆了井亭当柴烧御寒。军校把这件事告诉文彦博，在座的客人都吓得腿发抖。文彦博却缓缓说：“天实在是太冷了，可以让他们拆了烧火取暖。”说完神态自若，继续饮酒作乐。士兵们一下子泄了气，找不到理由寻衅闹事。第二天，文彦博查清楚是谁先动手拆井亭的，把那个人打了一顿。这几个《智囊》上的故事，说明遇到事情镇静自如，冷静思考，才能很好地解决问题。</p>
<p>多匿采韬光，常逊美公善</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>杨修①之躯见杀于曹操，以露己之长也；韦诞②之墓见发于钟繇③，以秘己之美也。故哲士④多匿采韬光⑤，至人常逊美⑥公善。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①杨修：字德祖，聪明有才，东汉建安年间举为孝廉，后为曹操主簿，被曹操杀害。</p>
<p>②韦诞：三国时魏国书法家，有文才。</p>
<p>③钟繇：字元常，三国时期曹魏著名书法家、政治家。</p>
<p>④哲士：聪明有学问的人。</p>
<p>⑤匿采韬光：隐藏才华，不露锋芒。匿，隐藏。韬，掩藏。</p>
<p>⑥逊美：谦让好的名声。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>杨修被曹操杀死，是因为他显露自己的才华；韦诞的墓穴被钟繇掘开，是因为韦诞的墓穴中藏有钟繇想要的宝物。所以聪明的人大多隐藏自己的才华，锋芒不露。品德高尚的人常常谦让美名，把善行归于大家。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>才华横溢的人，有时候会引来别人嫉恨。拥有珍奇宝物的人，很容易引来别人争抢。要避免这些祸害，就需要隐藏自己的才华或珍宝，不轻易让别人知道，这样也就不容易引起别人的嫉恨与争夺。处事老练的人，懂得谦让好名声，懂得将好处分给大家。不会一个人把所有的美名善行统统包揽。</p>
<p>杨修是一位非常有才华的人，他才思敏捷，才华横溢。同时他也是一个不懂得谦虚谨慎的人，有时候难免会给人留下炫耀才能的印象。过于显露才华，是他惹来杀生之祸的重要原因。韦诞的墓穴被钟繇掘开，是因为墓中藏了钟繇的宝物。人们常说“匹夫无罪，怀璧其罪”，拥有珍奇宝物的人，常常引得别人艳羡，从而生出想把宝物据为己有的念头。所以处世中，要善于隐藏自己的才华，不轻易在别人面前显示自己的能耐。这样做是保存自身安全的做法。</p>
<p>现代社会中竞争激烈，为了使别人注意到自己的才华，从而在竞争中脱颖而出，很多时候我们不仅不能掩藏自己的才华，相反会想出很多办法去推销自己的才华。如此看来，似乎匿采韬光的做法已经落伍。其实匿采韬光的做法与积极推销自己才能的行为，二者之间并不矛盾。在必要的时候，就要主动推销自己的才干，古人中很多人也是懂得自我推销的人。但是在不需要展露自己才华的时候，就需要将才华隐藏起来，保持谦虚谨慎。这样做能够避免无谓的困扰，也能防止引来别人的嫉恨。何时展现才华，何时隐藏才华，这全在自己把握。为争取有价值、有意义的事情，而展现自己的才华是必要的。为一些琐碎无意义的事情，炫耀自己的才干，这样做就是无价值的。同时有好事情，大家一起分享，这样才能团结人心，使别人真正信服。</p>
<p>人而皆好名，开诈善之门</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>君子好名，便起欺人之念；小人好名，犹怀畏人之心。故人而皆好名，则开诈善之门；使人而不好名，则绝为善之路。此讥好名者当审责①夫君子，不当过求于小人也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①审责：明确责任，审问。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>君子喜欢好名声，便有可能会产生欺骗别人的念头；小人喜欢好名声，还怀有畏惧别人的心理。所以人们都喜欢好名声，就会打开伪善的大门；如果使人们不追求好名声，就会断绝做善事的道路。嘲讽喜欢名誉的人，应当审责那些君子们，不应当过分要求小人们。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>如果人人都喜欢出名，很容易开启伪善的大门。如果人人都不在意自己的名声如何，那又会断绝行善做好事的道路。这确实是一个矛盾。在意自己的名声，一方面能够使人们在做事情的时候有所顾忌，如果自己做的事情不体面、不光彩，由于人们还在意自己的名声，这样可以促使人们有所收敛，不会肆无忌惮地做坏事。如果人人都不在意自己的名声如何，甚至于声名狼藉的人对于自己的坏名声不以为耻反以为荣，那我们整个社会的发展前途也就非常令人担忧了。在意自己的名声如何，另一方面又可能使人产生欺诈骗人的念头。当自己做了不体面的事情时，因为好名因而不想使别人知道自己的过错，不肯承认错误，拼命掩饰自己的过失。当自己并没有做什么有意义的事情时，因为好名因而欺骗别人，使别人相信自己为社会创造了很多价值，或者夸大自己的实力，以致于盛名之下其实难副。</p>
<p>由此可见，人们喜好名声，既能给社会带来益处，也会给社会带来损害。在这个问题上，道德品行优良的人以及社会上的精英人士，似乎应当担负起更大的责任。因为对于一般人而言，要面子、爱好名声，能够起到促使人去恶从善的作用。而对于社会精英人士、道德品行优良的人而言，爱慕虚名，就有可能使他们欺世盗名，危害社会。这些人如果不做好事，对社会的破坏作用要比普通人大许多。宋朝时候的武将狄青，有人说唐朝时有名的贤臣狄仁杰是狄青的祖上，狄青对此予以否认，说自己出身低微，不愿意认名臣狄仁杰为自己的祖上。明朝开国皇帝朱元璋，也不肯认宋代的著名学者朱熹为自己祖上。这种不攀附名人，不贪慕虚名的做法，一方面体现了狄青与朱元璋的诚实之处，另一方面也体现了两个人的骄傲自尊。真正的正人君子不会贪慕虚名。</p>
<p>须防绵里针，宜远刀头蜜</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>大恶多从柔处伏，哲士①须防绵里之针②；深仇常自爱中来，达人③宜远刀头之蜜④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①哲士：贤明有智慧的人。</p>
<p>②绵里之针：丝绵里面的针，比喻外面柔和而内藏刚硬、祸心的事或人。</p>
<p>③达人：乐观豁达、通情达理的人。</p>
<p>④刀头之蜜：刀头上抹着蜜，比喻外表甜蜜而内心歹毒的人或事。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>巨大的祸事大多潜伏在平安安逸的地方，所以有智慧的人需要防备丝绵里藏的针刺；深仇大恨常常是从亲厚爱恋中产生，豁达的人应当远远避开刀尖上抹的蜜。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>春秋时代，齐桓公得到管仲的辅佐，得以称霸中原。管仲病重的时候，齐桓公去看望管仲，问管仲谁能接任相位。管仲推荐了隰朋。管仲还说：“希望您能远离易牙、竖刁、卫公子启方、常之巫等人。”齐桓公说：“易牙善于烹调，我曾经说自己吃过各种飞禽走兽，只是没有尝过人肉的滋味，易牙就把自己的儿子杀了，把他儿子的肉煮了给我吃。这样对我，还有什么可以怀疑的呢？”管仲说：“人没有不爱惜自己儿子的，如果他对自己的儿子都能如此残忍，对君主又怎么能忠心呢？”齐桓公说：“竖刁自宫侍候我，难道他还有什么可疑之处吗？”管仲说：“人没有不爱惜自己身体的，能够下狠心来残毁自己的身体，那么对君主又怎么能忠心呢？”齐桓公又说：“常之巫能断定人的死期，可以治疗我的顽固疾病，难道对他也要怀疑吗？”管仲说：“死生疾病都是由天命与人命决定，靠常之巫治疗顽疾、断定死生，他会以此为把柄，为所欲为了。”齐桓公说：“卫公子启方，侍奉我已多年，他父亲亡故他都没有回去奔丧，他对待我比对他父母还亲厚，这样的人也不值得信任吗？”管仲说：“人最亲的莫过于父母，他对待自己的至亲都能够如此无情无义，又何况对待别人呢？”</p>
<p>齐桓公答应管仲，把易牙、竖刁、卫公子启方、常之巫等人都驱逐了。管仲死了之后，过了三年，齐桓公食不甘味，感到生活没有乐趣，也无心治理政事。他想仲父的话是不是太不过分了，那几个人哪能带来什么危害。再加上身边的妃妾们煽风点火，她们说：“您老了，为什么要这样自己苦自己呢？”于是齐桓公就把那四个人召了回来，生活果然又有趣许多，只是过了不久，这几个人勾结起来作乱，把宫门堵塞，不准任何人进去。同时在宫外筑造起高墙，不准人送食物给齐桓公。齐桓公临死前叹息，后悔没有听从管仲的劝诫。齐桓公身为一代霸主，却死得异常凄凉，实在是令人感叹。这就是由于他被小人甜蜜的外表所迷惑，却没有看穿小人心中包藏的祸心。</p>
<p>蝶恋花</p>
<p>持身涉世时，勿随境而迁</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>持身涉世，不可随境而迁。须是大火流金①，而清风穆然②；严霜杀物，而和气蔼然③；阴霾④翳⑤空，而慧日⑥朗然⑦；洪涛倒海，而破柱屹然。方是宇宙内的真人品。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①大火流金：形容天气非常炎热。流，销熔。流金，使金子熔化。</p>
<p>②穆然：静思的样子，这里指柔和的样子。</p>
<p>③蔼然：温柔可亲的样子。</p>
<p>④阴霾：天气阴沉，昏暗。</p>
<p>⑤翳：遮蔽。</p>
<p>⑥慧日：佛家语，佛的智慧就像太阳那样普照世间，因此称之为慧日。</p>
<p>⑦朗然：清澈明亮的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>安身立命、经历世事的时候，不可以随着环境的改变而改变自己的道德品行。需要像在大火流金那样酷热的环境下，依然能如清风那般轻柔；处在严霜酷寒的环境下，依然能保持满腔和气；处在阴沉昏暗、不见天日的环境中，依然能保持清澈明朗；在怒涛汹涌、翻江倒海的环境中，能够像中流砥柱那样屹立不倒，这才是宇宙中真正优良的人品。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“疾风知劲草，板荡识忠臣”，在艰难困苦的环境中，在遭受挫折的情况下，最能显示出一个人的真正品行。经受得住恶劣环境的考验，在严霜酷暑的环境中同样能谈笑自如，就像在风和日丽的环境中一样，这才是真正有傲骨忠诚的人。在中国历史上有许多这样的事例，当环境优越舒适的时候，一些人争权夺势，到国家有急难的时候，这些争权夺势的人往往退到后面，为国家奋不顾身的往往是那些平日里安分守己、不争宠夺利的人。宋朝时，当辽国入侵的时候，抵抗辽兵保卫国家的是杨继业等忠臣，当国家平安无事的时候，得宠弄权的又是另外一些人。南宋末年，元兵入侵，文天祥被擒获，誓死不归降元朝，保持了民族气节。明朝末年，清兵入关，明朝旧臣有归降大清的，也有保持民族气节誓死不降的。在这种时刻，最能看出一个人的气节、品质如何。</p>
<p>在如今的社会中，我们也许曾经有过许多理想，但是当在现实生活中遇到挫折困难的时候很多理想也就化为泡影。有一位美籍华人曾经说过，当年很多人抱着各种各样的理想来到美国。在多年之后，很多人从事着各式各样的工作，但是把自己最初的理想付诸实践的人却并不多。很多人由于境遇的改变，于是随境而迁，将自己的某些理想与优良品质都丢弃掉了。很多时候人们对于自己无法坚持最初的理想信念和优良品质，常常说是因为环境使然，自己实在是身不由己。如果能做到不论环境如何，都能保持自己优良的品质，坚持自己的理想追求，这种境界非常令人羡慕，值得我们为之付出努力。尽管不可能人人都达到这种境界，但是在追求的过程中也定能使我们有所收获。</p>
<p>受人毁增美，受人欺为福</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>毁人者不美，而受人之毁者遭一番讪谤①便加一番修省，可以释回②而增美③；欺人者非福，而受人欺者遇一番横逆便长一番器宇④，可以转祸而为福。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①讪谤：诋毁，诽谤。</p>
<p>②释回：消除邪念歪行。</p>
<p>③增美：增加良好的德行。</p>
<p>④器宇：胸怀，气量。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>喜欢诋毁别人的人，他的品德并不优良，而遭到别人毁谤的人每遭受一次毁谤便增加一回自我反省，这样就可以减少不良的品行，增加优良的品行；喜欢欺负别人的人没有福气，而受别人欺负的人每受一次磨难便增长一番气量，可以使祸害转变成福气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>喜欢诋毁别人的人，在现实生活中其实并不受欢迎。大家往往对那些喜欢讲是非、说别人长短的人敬而远之。总是攻击指责别人，首先就使自己的道德品行有所欠缺。受到别人毁谤的人，如果能以平和心态对待，那么能够使别人的毁谤为自己增福。对于别人的毁谤，可以平心静气地分析，反省自身。如果别人对自己的指责确实没有错，自己在某些地方有所欠缺，可以通过反省加以改进。如果别人对自己的指责是无中生有，那么就更没有生气的理由，因为他指责的其实并不是真实的我，我又何必为此烦恼呢。这样一来，可以使自己不断进步，同时能够使自己心胸开阔。所以遇到别人说自己的是非，其实并不完全是坏事，主要看自己如何应对。如果能深刻反省自身，“有则改之，无则加勉”，对于自己不断进步能够起到很好的促进作用。</p>
<p>美国石油大亨洛克菲勒，有一次正在办公室里工作，突然闯进来一个人。这个人气势汹汹，警卫都拦他不住。这个人冲到洛克菲勒的面前，开始大声责骂洛克菲勒。警卫在一旁非常紧张，洛克菲勒没有生气，他耐心地听着这个人大声咆哮。来人的火气渐渐小了些，声音也低了下来，洛克菲勒这才询问他究竟是为了什么事情变得如此愤怒。这个人说明自己生气的缘故之后，洛克菲勒耐心为他解释，直到这个人气消了离开。洛克菲勒在面对别人无故的指责时，没有火冒三丈，而是保持着冷静与风度，耐心为对方解释，最终获得了对方的理解与认可。我们在生活中不做诋毁别人的事情，当遇到别人无缘无故的指责时，也不需要生气发火。多多自我反省，发现自己的缺点与不足，有错就改，没有过错就多反省，这样既可以增加我们宽容大度的气量，又能促使我们不断进步。</p>
<p>骄人有侠气，欺世无真心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>贫贱骄人，虽涉虚矫①，还有几分侠气；英雄欺世，纵似挥霍②，全没半点真心。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①虚矫：没有真本事而骄傲自负，浮华不实。</p>
<p>②挥霍：轻捷，随意浪费财物。这里是奔放、洒脱的意思。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>贫贱的人骄傲自负，虽然有些浮华不实，还有几分侠客的气质；英雄欺骗世人，纵然看似洒脱、豪放，却完全没有一点真心。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>贫贱的人能够骄傲自负，虽然有些虚夸不实在，但是这种骄傲自负还带着几分侠客的气质。如果处在贫穷困苦之中，一味软弱悲伤，就太没有骨气了。因此处在贫困的环境中，能够保持骄傲自信，这是有几分侠气的表现。如果身为英雄豪杰，却欺世盗名，无论他表现得如何潇洒豪爽，其实只不过是毫无真心诚意的虚伪之人罢了。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是某一天，一个买了新车的人开着车兜风。这个时候，天下起雨来。于是这个人把车停到停车场，下车准备吃点东西，忽然有一个小孩走到他面前。男孩子羡慕地看着新车，问车主自己能不能摸一摸这车。车主看着男孩热切的目光，笑着说当然可以。车主去买快餐，返回来的时候发现男孩子还在停车场，仔细观察着新车，脸上流露出羡慕不已的表情。新车的主人就请这个男孩子上车，开车带男孩子去兜风。在车中，男孩子看着所有东西都觉得很新奇，他对新车的主人讲起自己的事情。男孩子还有一个妹妹，他们家搬来这个城市不久，妹妹有病，家里生活条件比较艰苦。最后男孩子问新车的主人，能不能把他送回家，他想让自己的妹妹也看一看这辆新车。车主微笑着答应了，对于一个小孩子的虚荣心，他不忍拒绝。当他开车把男孩子送到家门口时，男孩子说了谢谢，然后飞快地跑回家，带自己的妹妹出来。男孩子指着新车对妹妹说，只要她能赶快好起来，有一天他也要买一辆这样的车送给她。男孩子的妹妹似乎很相信哥哥的话，听到哥哥说将来要送新车给自己，异常开心。新车的主人突然被这个男孩子的自信感动，在艰苦的生活环境中，男孩子对未来的生活保持着积极乐观的精神，也许有一点虚荣，只是这样的虚荣不使人厌恶。当处在艰难困苦的环境中时，这种积极乐观、骄傲自信的精神能够鼓舞人们战胜挫折与困难。</p>
<p>廉官多无后，痴人每多福</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>廉官多无后，以其太清也；痴人每多福，以其近厚也。故君子虽重廉洁①，不可无含垢纳污之雅量；虽戒痴顽②，亦不必有察渊洗垢之精明。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①廉洁：清白高洁。</p>
<p>②痴顽：愚蠢顽劣。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>清廉的官员大多没有后代，是因为他们太高洁了；傻人往往福气多，是因为他们接近宽厚纯朴。所以君子虽然看重清正廉洁，却不可以没有含污纳垢的气量；虽然戒除愚蠢顽劣，也不必探究渊源、清洗污垢、过于精明。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>春秋时代，齐桓公得到管仲辅佐而称霸主。管仲病重的时候，齐桓公问管仲谁能接替他的职位。管仲举荐了隰朋。齐桓公就问鲍叔牙如何。管仲说鲍叔牙是一个君子，品行端正，大仁大义。但是他为人对于善恶分得过于分明，并且极其厌恶品行不端的人。别人有过错，他会一直记在心上。这样的人不能够担任丞相职位。管仲还提醒齐桓公千万不要任用易牙、竖刁、卫公子等人。管仲这些话被易牙知道后，易牙怀恨在心。他去拜访鲍叔牙进行挑拨，说：“仲父是您推荐的，现在国君要任用您为相，仲父却不同意，反而举荐了隰朋，仲父这样做太不应该了。”管仲与鲍叔牙是好朋友，当年管仲能够辅佐齐桓公，得力于鲍叔牙的大力举荐。鲍叔牙听了易牙的话笑着说：“这正是我当年举荐管仲为相的原因，管仲忠于国家，不徇私情。我做司寇正可以发挥我的长处，如果我当国相还能有你们这些小人的容身之处吗？”易牙听了这话羞愧满面地走了。</p>
<p>鲍叔牙为人嫉恶如仇，对于小人不能包容，他对自己这个特点认识清楚，所以将相位让出，在齐桓公面前推荐了管仲。为人处事中，需要有包容的雅量。古人说“水至清则无鱼，人至察则无徒”，每个人都会多多少少有一些缺点，所以我们需要有能包容与容忍的气量。如果每件事情都分出是非对错，这样生活就太累了，而且也容易吓走别人，使自己交不到好朋友。在工作中，如果和同事斤斤计较，不能包容同事的一些小缺点，这样也不利于工作的顺利开展。因此我们需要具有包容的气量。</p>

<p>失血于杯中，笑猩猩嗜酒</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>失血于杯中，堪笑猩猩之嗜酒①；为巢于幕上②，气可怜燕燕之偷安。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①猩猩之嗜酒：据《艺文类聚》引《蜀志》曰：“封溪县有兽曰猩猩，人以酒取之，猩猩觉，初暂尝之，得其味甘而饮之，终见羁缨也。”比喻贪图一时享乐，使自己陷入危险之中。</p>
<p>②为巢于幕上：在幕帘上筑造窝巢，比喻陷入危险的境地而不自知。据《左传》：“夫子之在此也，犹燕之巢于幕上。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>被人杀掉放血在杯子中，有如猩猩嗜好那诱惑它上钩的美酒；燕子在幕帘上筑造巢穴，苟且偷安，看不到即将到来的危险。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>晋国的智伯要攻打卫国，先给卫国国君送去四百匹好马，玉璧一块。卫王很是高兴，大臣们也纷纷祝贺。只有南文子不高兴，一脸苦恼的样子。卫王问他：“大国赠送礼物给我们，我们都很高兴，你为什么表现出很忧愁的样子？”南文子回答说：“无功不受禄，没有功劳却得到赏赐，需要弄清楚对方的用意啊。四百匹马，玉璧一块，这是小国给大国送礼的规格，如今却是大国送给小国，大王您要警惕晋国啊！”卫王认为他说的有道理，于是增派兵驻守边境。后来智伯果然派兵来袭击卫国，发现卫国早有准备后，就退回去了。智伯感慨地说：“卫国有高明的人，能够事先察觉我的计谋！”无故获得好处，需要我们多想一想这好处是不是诱饵。生活中有很多骗子行骗的事情，这些骗子之所以能够行骗成功，很多时候不是由于骗子有多么高的聪明才智，而是他们善于利用人的弱点。人的弱点有很多，其中被骗子多次利用的一点就是人的贪心。如果能不贪心，对于不属于自己的财物毫不动心，那么就能避开很多骗局与陷阱。</p>
<p>燕子在危险的地方筑造巢穴，只看到了眼前平安，却看不到更大的危险。生活中也有很多这样的事例。所以我们最好能保持积极拼搏的精神，在生活中不苟且偷安，这样能使我们享有长久平安。美国总统林肯曾经讲过一个故事，他说在家乡干农活的时候，发现他们的马身上落满了马蝇。林肯不忍心看到他们的马被叮咬，于是赶走马背上的马蝇，但是林肯的兄弟却阻止他这么做。林肯的兄弟说正是由于有马蝇的存在，马才会跑得快，如果没有了马蝇，马反而会慢下来。在我们生活中也是如此，如果能时常感觉到危险与紧迫，会促使我们取得更大的进步。</p>
<p>至人常虚无，盛德多不矜</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鹤立鸡群，可谓超然无侣矣。然进而观于大海之鹏，则渺然自小。又进而求之九霄之凤①，则巍乎莫及。所以至人常若无若虚，而盛德②多不矜不伐③也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①九霄之凤：翱翔在高空中的凤凰。九霄，天之极高处，高空。</p>
<p>②盛德：崇高的品德，深厚的恩德。</p>
<p>③不矜不伐：不居功自夸。不自以为了不起，不为自己吹嘘，不居功自傲。矜、伐，自夸自大的意思。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>鹤在鸡群中，可以说是卓越超群没有谁能比得上了。然而进一步看大海中的大鹏鸟，鹤就显得非常渺小了。再进一步与飞翔在高空中的凤凰相比，就更显得凤凰高远不可及了。所以品行高洁、品德修养高超的人常常非常谦虚，有崇高品德的人大多不会居功自傲、自以为是。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>真正卓越不凡，有所成就的人，往往表现得很谦虚，生活上也与普通人没有多大差别。居里夫人在成名后，年薪已经增加到几万法郎，生活可以过得比较舒适，但是她依然保持着简朴的生活习惯。她每次从宴会上回来，都会带回来一些宴会上的菜单。这些菜单都是由质地精良的纸片制成的，居里夫人可以在这些菜单的背面写算物理或数学题。她的一件大衣，穿了将近20年。第一次见到居里夫人的人，有人感觉她像是一个忙碌的贫穷妇人。有一次，有一位记者想采访这名著名的科学家。当记者走到一所村子里时，他看到一家农户门前坐着一个妇人，他向这位光着脚坐在石板上的妇人打听居里夫人住在哪里。当这位女子抬起头来的时候，记者感到非常吃惊，原来这位妇女就是世界闻名的科学家居里夫人。有朋友去居里夫人家拜访，与居里夫人谈得很投机，这时候居里夫妇的小女儿跑过来跑过去玩得很开心。朋友突然发现，居里夫妇的小女儿手中的玩具就是他们曾经获得的诺贝尔奖章。朋友大吃一惊，问居里夫人怎么把奖章给女儿当玩具呢？居里夫人不以为意地说这样做是想教育孩子，让她们从小就懂得荣誉其实并没有什么，那只是代表你过去的成就，不要太看重你曾经获得的荣誉。居里夫人的生活可以说是和普通人没什么差别，她在生活中保持平凡质朴的本色，但是她却在科学领域作出了非常重要的贡献。</p>
<p>懂得谦虚的人是真正明智的人。鹤在鸡群中算是卓越不凡的，但是和大海中的大鹏鸟相比就显得渺小，再和高空翱翔的凤凰相比，就显得更为渺小了。使鹤相形见绌的凤凰，放在整个宇宙中来看，那就简直是微乎其微了。所以说懂得谦虚的人是真正聪慧的人，骄傲自夸的人就像井底之蛙一样目光短浅。</p>
<p>人心不可偏，心偏有为无</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>贪心胜者，逐兽而不见泰山在前，弹雀而不知深井在后；疑心胜者，见弓影而惊杯中之蛇，听人言而信市上之虎①。人心一偏，遂视有为无，造无作有。如此，心可妄动乎哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①信市上之虎：市上本来没有虎，但是人们传说有虎，传说的人多了，大家就信以为真。据《战国策•魏策》：“夫市之无虎明矣，然而三人言而成虎。”形容任何事情经过多人传说，本来不存在的事情，人们也信以为真。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>贪心过盛的人，追逐野兽看不见泰山就在前面，弹射鸟雀不知道深井就在后面；疑心过盛的人，看见弓影就惊吓地以为是酒杯中的蛇，听到人言就相信市上有虎。心灵有了偏颇，就算是有也会当做没有，把没有当做有。这样，人心便胡乱行动了！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《智囊》上有这样一个故事，说的是京城里有个医生，有一天一个妇人请他看病，这个妇人跟着丈夫在外地住的时候，曾经不小心吃下去一条虫子。从此她一直疑惑，久而久之成了心病，多次求医都没有治愈。医生知道妇人犯病的原因后，就在妇人的家人中找到一个严谨的老太太，嘱咐这个老太太说：“今天我用药使病人呕吐，她吐的时候，您用盆子接着，并且要告诉她说：‘有一只蛤蟆吐出来了’，但是不能让病人知道这是在骗她。”老太太照着医生的话去做，妇人的心病果然治好了。</p>
<p>栽花少栽刺，积书少积货</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>多栽桃李少栽荆①，便是开条福路；不积诗书偏积货②，还如筑个祸基③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①少栽荆：荆，一种植物，荆与棘丛生容易阻塞道路。少栽荆，也就是说不要自己给自己增加困难与阻碍。</p>
<p>②货：各种财物。</p>
<p>③祸基：祸根。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>多栽种果实甜美的桃树与李树，少栽种带刺阻塞道路的荆棘，这就是为自己打通了一条通往幸福的道路；不积攒诗书偏积攒许多财物，这就是给自己打下了一个惹祸的根基。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>常言道“种瓜得瓜种豆得豆”，播下什么种子，收获什么样的果实。种下桃李树，收获芬芳的桃子与李子；种下荆棘，收获蔓延丛生的荆棘，阻塞了自己的道路。多积累诗书，学习知识，有了一身本领，也就为自己打通了一条通向幸福的路。积累承载知识的书，远比积累财富更为重要。金银财物多了，惹起别人嫉妒，便是给自己种下一个祸根。据史书记载，清朝时有姓马的两个兄弟。这两兄弟是盐商，当时盐业是非常赚钱的行业，马氏兄弟赚了很多钱，家资积累丰厚，变成了大富商。他们渐渐开始不满足于仅物质财富积累，想到要收藏书。当时中国有不少藏书点，他们决定成为藏书最多的人。他们收集各种图书，建造“街南书屋”，书屋内有上百个橱柜，收藏图书达10万多卷。他们广泛收集精品图书，藏书同时注意研究，藏书范围非常广。马氏兄弟没有将书藏起来“秘而不宣”，而是当社会上有需要时，他们家的书可以广泛借阅。人们常说商人唯利是图，但是马氏兄弟表现得却并不是只图利。他们看到了知识重要，以藏书为爱好，得到当时皇帝嘉奖。</p>
<p>中国历史上有一个有名富人石崇，他家中积攒众多宝物，非常有钱。石崇生活奢侈，曾与皇帝的亲戚王恺比富。王恺用糖水洗锅，石崇把蜡烛当柴烧；王恺家做了四十里的丝布步障，石崇便做五十里的锦步障；王恺用赤石脂涂墙壁，石崇便用花椒涂墙。王恺带了一棵上好的珊瑚树来见石崇，石崇看后将珊瑚树击碎。王恺大怒，石崇说：“不要生气，我赔给你。”石崇命令家人把家里的珊瑚树都搬出来，这些珊瑚树比王恺那棵高出许多，且光耀夺目。相比之下，王恺那棵实在不算稀奇。石崇的巨大财富终于为他带来了杀生之祸，他临死前感叹别人贪图他的家财所以害他。</p>
<p>学海无涯，知识掌握越多越好。对知识的索求永远不会嫌多，一位学识渊博、品行端正的人不会惹来嫉妒，相反会赢得别人尊敬。积累财富本身没有过错，错在只是一味贪恋财物，对财富的索求永无止境。有了银山又想要金山，将各种财物据为己有，这样贪婪才容易为自己带来灾祸。</p>
<p>大聪明之人，小事必朦胧</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>大聪明的人，小事必朦胧；大懵懂①的人，小事必伺察②。盖伺察乃懵懂之根，而朦胧正聪明之窟也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①懵懂：头脑不清楚，不能明辨事物。</p>
<p>②伺察：侦察，观察。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>真正聪明的人，在小事上必然比较糊涂；真正糊涂的人，在小事上必然会仔细观察。在小事上用心是在大事上糊涂的根源，对小事不在意正是大聪明的根由。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有这样一副对联：“诸葛一生唯谨慎，吕端大事不糊涂。”诸葛亮一生都谨慎小心，吕端则是在大事上决不糊涂。吕端是北宋时期人，他曾任成都和蔡州知府，后来升为枢密直学士。宋太宗打算升他为相，有人说吕端为人糊涂。宋太宗说：“端小事糊涂，大事不糊涂。”也是说吕端只是在小事上糊涂，在大事上是绝对不糊涂的。宋太宗病危，吕端每天都陪着太子到太宗床前探病。宦官王继恩串通皇后，阴谋废立太子，想拥立楚王为太子。太宗病故，皇后召见吕端，提起废立太子的事情。吕端明确表明，先帝在的时候已经确立谁为太子。他率领大臣共同拥戴太子登基，真宗登基后，吕端确认清楚上面所坐之人确实是太子，这才率领众大臣向皇帝磕头跪拜。事后将那些阴谋叛乱的人，都依法处置，果断地处理了叛乱。</p>
<p>陆羽烹茶图</p>
<p>李继迁反叛，朝廷抓住了他的母亲。有人主张把他的母亲杀死。吕端进言说：“如果杀了他的母亲，他会仇恨朝廷，这样会使他反叛的念头更加坚定。不如把他的母亲好生安置起来，招他投降。即使他不来归降，他的母亲在我们掌握之中，这对于他始终是一个牵制。”皇上听从了吕端的建议，后来李继迁的母亲病死，李继迁也死去，叛乱由此平息。吕端平时表现似乎有些糊涂笨拙，其实他是大智若愚。在真正遇到大是大非的时候，他比一般人都明白得多。吕端为官非常清廉，他不置个人产业，从不贪污受贿。在他去世之后，他的子孙们生活过得比较清苦。在个人利益问题上，他是糊涂的，但是在事关大局的时候，他从不糊涂。这也正是大智若愚的表现。真正有大智慧的人，在一些小事上比较糊涂，但是在事关大局的事情上心中如明镜。如果能做到大事小事一样聪明有智慧当然最好，但是这种境界实在不容易达到，那么我们可以使自己的精力多花费在有价值的事情上，从而做到在大事上决不糊涂。</p>
<p>众人忧乐情，君子忧乐理</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>众人以顺境为乐，而君子乐自逆境中来；众人以拂意①为忧，而君子忧从快意处起。盖众人忧乐以情，而君子忧乐以理②也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①拂意：不顺意，不顺心。</p>
<p>②理：理智，理性。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一般人都以处在顺境中高兴，可是君子却能从逆境中发现快乐；一般人因为遇到不顺心的事情而感到忧愁，可是君子的忧愁却是在事事称心如意的时候产生。这是因为一般人的快乐与忧愁是由自己的情感决定的，而君子的快乐与忧愁却是由理智决定的。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一般人会因为处在顺境中而感到快乐，有智慧的人却能从逆境中发现乐趣。趋乐避苦是人们的天性，没有谁会喜欢苦难。只是苦与乐是一对矛盾，有乐就会有苦，有顺境就会有逆境。正如花不会常开不谢一样，人们有聚就有散，有快乐就会有痛苦。无论人们如何想逃开苦难，如何想长久拥有快乐幸福，苦难都不会因为人们的主观愿望而改变。人们相互之间送祝福时，总喜欢说祝对方万事顺利。事实上人们也知道万事如意、事事顺利只不过是一种美好的愿望罢了。人们在生活中总会遇到这样或者那样的挫折。既然避不开苦难，那么未雨绸缪，在困难与挫折没有来临之前，提前做好准备，这样就不会在挫折与困难面前束手无策了。</p>
<p>在挫折与困难到来时积极应对，在挫折与困难中磨炼自己，能使自己战胜困难与挫折的能力得到不断提高。</p>
<p>因此有智慧的人才能从逆境中找到乐趣，而并不是只有处在顺境时才感到快乐。有智慧的人遇到不顺心的事情时，并不过分忧愁，相反在事事顺心如意的时候才更感到不安。古人说“艰难困苦，玉汝于成”，艰难困苦是磨砺人们，使人们走向成功的基石。世界著名音乐家贝多芬创作出许多优秀的乐曲，其实这些乐曲中有很多是在他耳聋之后创作出来的。对于一个音乐家而言，听力受损是一个非常大的打击，但是贝多芬在挫折中并没有被打败，他克服困难，创作出大量优秀乐曲，积极创造了自己的生命价值。从感情上说，没有人愿意遇到挫折困难。人们都愿意万事顺利，事事称心如意，但是这只能是一种美好的愿望，却不可能实现。成熟睿智的人，能够用理性支配自己的行动，因此身处逆境中也并不会过于忧愁。</p>
<p>盖悔愧二字，能去恶迁善</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>谢豹覆面①，犹知自愧；唐鼠易肠②，犹知自悔。盖愧、悔二字，乃吾人去恶迁善之门，起死回生之路也。人生若无此念头，便是既死之寒灰，已枯之槁木矣，何处讨些生理③？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①谢豹覆面：谢豹，杜鹃别名，这里指一种小虫。唐段成式《酉阳杂俎•虫篇》：“虢州有虫名谢豹，常在深土中，司马裴、沉子常治坑获之。小类虾蟆而圆如球，见人，以前两脚交覆首，如羞状。能穴地如鼢鼠，顷刻深数尺。或出地听谢豹鸟声，则脑裂而死，俗因名之。”</p>
<p>②唐鼠易肠：唐鼠，鼠名。易，换、改变。《艺文类聚》引《梁州记》：“山有易肠鼠，一月三吐其肠。束广微所谓唐鼠者也。”</p>
<p>③生理：生存的道理。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>谢豹看见人就遮住自己的脸，还知道惭愧；唐鼠换肠，还知道悔过。“悔”、“愧”两个字，是我们弃恶从善的门，是我们起死回生的路。人生如果没有后悔与惭愧的念头，就成了冰冷的死灰、枯槁的朽木，从哪里找到生存的道理呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>谢豹见了人还知道把脸遮挡住，知道害羞惭愧。唐鼠经常换肠，还知道悔改。动物都知道悔改与惭愧，何况是人呢。犯了错误并不可怕，只要能懂得悔改就好。有很多地方不如别人，也没有关系，只要知道惭愧能努力使自己变得更好，那么总有一天能赶上别人或者超过别人。悔改与惭愧是我们弃恶扬善的大门，是我们起死回生的路径。如果把这大门与路径丢弃，人生也就变得像死灰槁木一样，毫无生机。</p>
<p>人们往往喜欢议论别人的过错，却不喜欢批评自己的过失。有时候甚至会死要面子，死不认错。古人说“闻过则喜”，这种境界非常不容易达到。很多时候，我们是“闻过则怒”，听不得别人说自己的缺点，有时候甚至会对别人白眼以对，或者还会加上一句：“你凭什么说我，你自己就没缺点过错吗？”孔子说“过而能改，善莫大焉”，正是因为现实生活中改过不是容易的事情，所以孔子才会这么说。</p>
<p>王安石罢免官职回乡后，有一次宋神宗与曾巩谈到王安石。曾巩和王安石是好朋友，宋神宗问曾巩王安石怎么样。曾巩说安石的文学才华不输于西汉扬雄，只不过因为安石吝啬，所以还比不上扬雄。宋神宗说：“安石看轻富贵，哪里吝啬了！”曾巩回答说：“臣说他吝啬，说的是他勇于有为，吝于改过耳。”吝于改过这几个字，适合于送给很多人，很多时候我们对于改过都是很吝啬的。</p>
<p>虽然改过不容易，但是我们还是需要勇于改过。宋太祖赵匡胤性格暴烈，有一次他骑马打猎，在追逐猎物的时候，马失前蹄跌倒，宋太祖摔倒在地。他非常生气，爬起来抽出佩刀就把马给砍死了。砍死马，他又感觉很后悔。他对身边人说：“我身为天子，自己不知道保重。喜欢打猎，已经是不对，又迁怒于马，实在是太不应该了。”从此以后他就不再打猎。宋太祖身为一国之君，能知道悔过，这种精神值得我们学习。</p>
<p>路窄留人行，味浓让人食</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>路径窄处，留一步与人行；滋味浓的，减三分让人食。此是涉世一极乐①法。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①极乐：非常快乐。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在道路狭窄的地方，给别人留出一些地方让人走；遇到滋味肥美可口的食物，要留出一些让给别人吃。这就是一个安身立命的安全快乐的方法。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在道路狭窄的时候，给对方留出一些地方。遇到美味佳肴的时候，不可以一个人独享，也要给别人留下一些。也就是说给别人留有一定余地，不能一个人把所有好事都包揽了，这是在为人处世中，与大家处理好关系、保持和睦团结的方法。“将相和”是我国历史上有名的典故。廉颇和蔺相如同是大功臣，两个人都为赵国立下功劳。蔺相如使玉璧完好送回赵国，并且没有使赵国受到侮辱，因此赵王封蔺相如做上卿。蔺相如职位比廉颇高，廉颇因此颇为不服气。他认为自己为赵国立下汗马功劳，而蔺相如不过是凭借三寸不烂之舌能说会道罢了。为此廉颇多次公开说要给蔺相如难堪，让蔺相如下不来台。蔺相如听说之后，就处处躲着廉颇。蔺相如的手下不服气，蔺相如开导他们说：“我并不是怕廉颇，秦王我都不惧怕，何况是廉颇。我躲着他是为了赵国。赵国武有廉颇，文有蔺相如，如果我们不和睦，就会使国家力量削弱。”蔺相如的这些话传到廉颇的耳中后，他非常惭愧，于是负荆请罪，请蔺相如原谅。蔺相如不争闲气，从大局出发，为对方留有余地，于是感动廉颇，使两个人保持了和睦团结。</p>
<p>贾复和寇恂是东汉光武帝刘秀手下两个功臣。有一次贾复的部将杀人，寇恂正在此地为官，于是就把这个杀人的部将逮捕并处死。贾复认为寇恂这样做有辱他的尊严，因此扬言说要杀死寇恂。寇恂便一直躲着贾复。寇恂的外甥请求在寇恂身边保护他的安全。寇恂说：“不需要这样做，当初蔺相如不怕秦王，却避让着廉颇，是为了国家利益，我也是如此。”于是寇恂对贾复以礼相对。光武帝知道这件事情后召见寇恂和贾复，使两个人重新成为朋友。寇恂也是以大局为重，对贾复忍让，使两人保持和睦团结，共同效力于国家。</p>
<p>宠利毋居前，德业毋落后</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>宠利①毋居人前，德业②毋落人后；受享毋逾分外③，修持④毋减分中⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①宠利：恩宠与利禄。</p>
<p>②德业：德行与功业。</p>
<p>③分外：本分以外。</p>
<p>④修持：修身守道。</p>
<p>⑤分中：分内。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>遇到与恩宠利禄有关的事情不要抢在别人前面，修养德行、建立功业不要落在别人后面；生活享受不要超出自己本分以外，修养身心、培养良好品德节操不要达不到自己分内应达到的水平。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>对于功名利禄的追求不要过于热衷，对于优良德行的追求不要落在别人后面。生活享受不要过分，品行修养不能落后。这样做可以使我们保持平和健康的心态，避开各种祸患麻烦，同时无愧于心地生活在世界上。</p>
<p>孙叔敖病重，弥留之际，他嘱咐自己的儿子们说：“从前大王几次要赏赐给我封地，我都拒绝了。我死了之后，大王必然会赏赐给你。你千万不要接受好的封地。在楚国和越国中间有一个叫寝邱的地方，这块地方不好，前面有妒谷，后面有戾丘，听起来名声很不好。楚国人阴险奸诈，越国人又灵巧乖觉，如果是好地方，怕是他们会来抢夺，这样名声不好的地方，他们是不会来争夺的。”孙叔敖死了之后，楚庄王果然把一块好地赏赐给他的儿子，孙叔敖的儿子拒绝了这块好地，只求楚庄王把寝邱赏赐给他。不要好地，一来可以避免争端，省去了别人争抢的麻烦。二来不过分享受，把好处让给别人，这也是一种安身自保的方法。</p>
<p>春秋时候，公孙仪在鲁国为相。他酷爱吃鱼。于是鲁国的官员们都争着买鱼送给他，公孙仪却不肯接受，婉言拒绝了。有人问他：“您非常喜欢吃鱼，现在有人送您鱼，您却不接受，这是为什么呢？”公孙仪回答说：“正是因为我非常喜欢吃鱼，所以才不能接受别人送的鱼。吃了人家的鱼，就得为人家办事，这样一来必然会违法乱纪。触犯了法纪，我的官职便保不住了。丢了官，谁还会给我送鱼呢？那时候自己想用自己的俸禄去买鱼也不可能了。不接受别人送的鱼，虽然没有白拿的鱼可以吃，却可以自己买来吃。”公孙仪是一位有智慧的人，他能认识到什么样的享受是允许的，什么样的享受是超出自己分内应得的。面对自己非常喜欢吃的鱼的诱惑，他能保持不动心，坚守本分，可以说是一位有德行而且有智慧的人。</p>
<p>处世让一步，待人宽一分</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>处世①让一步为高，退步即进步的张本②；待人宽一分是福，利人实利己的根基。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①处世：待人接物，应付世情，与世人相处交往。</p>
<p>②张本：准备，开始，为事态发展预先做的安排。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>为人处世知道让人一步道理的人是高明的人，退一步是为了将来进步做准备；对待别人宽厚真诚是福气，使别人得利是使自己获利的基础。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“与人方便，自己方便”，对待别人宽容，也是为自己留下余地。中外历史上很多名人，他们的所作所为正是真正体现了宽容大度。从前古公亶父带着他的部落居住在邠地，但是不时地受到狄人的骚扰。每次狄人来侵扰，亶父就把皮裘、丝绸、好狗、骏马等财物送给狄人。古公亶父部族弱小，因此采取了不抵抗的策略。狄人收到礼物，并没有停止对亶父部族的侵犯。亶父想到狄人这样频繁进攻，是想占有土地，于是将自己的部族迁移到歧山地区。在这个地方，亶父的部族发展强大起来。古公亶父面对狄人的进攻，采取了避让的措施，是因为自己部族弱小，因此暂时退步。暂时退步是为将来进步做准备，古公亶父的部族最终强大起来，这正体现了暂时的退让能够为将来的进步打基础。所以一时的退让并不可怕，有时候退让一步可以使我们更好地前进。</p>
<p>萧伯纳听说有人称他为驴的时候，并不生气。萧伯纳把这种称呼当成是别人在赞美他。他说：“驴子有很多美德，驴子勤奋谦虚，对待生活还懂得知足常乐的道理，对于粗劣的食物和别人的轻视都能泰然处之。没有一个人会因为有这样的美德而不高兴的。”当听到有人批评自己有两张脸的时候，林肯微笑着指着自己并不俊美的脸说：“如果我还有一张脸，我还会继续戴着现在这张脸吗？”林肯以幽默大度回答了批评他的人。画家毕加索对于仿造他作品的假画丝毫不在意，从来也不追究。有时候只是把伪造的签名涂掉。他解释说：“卖假画的人也要过生活，那些鉴定画作真假的人也需要有工作。”萧伯纳、林肯以及毕加索这些在各自领域都有所成就的人，保持了谦虚宽容的心态，在为人处世中都坚持了宽容待人的原则。对待别人宽容大度也是对自己宽容大度，宽以待人才能从别人那里收获善意。</p>

<p>完美的名声和节操，不要一个人独占，分出来一些给别人，可以避开祸害保全自身；耻辱的行为和污秽的名声，不可以全部推给别人，自己也承担一部分，可以掩藏自己的才华，修养自己的德行。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>完美的名声与节操，不要一个人全部占有，分一些出来给别人，这样才能避开别人的嫉妒与怨恨，使大家保持和睦与团结。如果一个人把完美的名声与节操全部占有，不肯分一点给别人，那就过于吝啬了，也容易使与自己共事的人心灰意冷，从而产生离去的念头。鲁国与齐国交战，鲁国军队溃退，盂之反走在军队后面殿后，掩护撤退的部队。当进入城门的时候，他抽打自己的坐骑，并且说：“不是我敢于殿后，是因为我的马跑不快啊。”盂之反这样说，是不想居功自傲，不想一个人把功劳包揽了。一方面显示了自己的风度，另一方面不独占功劳，也就不至于招惹来别人的嫉恨。</p>

<p>在现代社会中，我们也需要有这种谦让的精神。有一个故事，说的是在文革时期，有一个大学生被分配到一个图书馆里工作。他酷爱读书，当看到图书馆中满地堆积的书时，非常高兴。他一面看书，一面花时间做把图书分类整理的工作。当时图书馆中还有一位员工，这个人比他工作早，是老员工。当看到这个新来的大学生自找麻烦，给图书分类整理上架时，不以为然，不过也没有阻止这个大学生。后来馆长来检查工作，发现图书被整理得整齐有序，灰尘与垃圾都不见了，馆长很高兴，表扬了新来的大学生。这个大学生听到馆长的表扬，没有得意，很谦虚地说工作是我们两个人一起做的。事实上，那个老员工并没有帮助他整理。他这样说，使得那个老员工对他有些感激，两个人的关系从此变得融洽起来。</p>
<p>耻辱的行为以及坏名声，人人避之不及。如果遇到有辱于自己的事情，不能全部推给别人去承受，自己也要承担一部分，这样做不会真正有损自己的节操，还能使自己韬光养晦，使自己的德行修养更趋完善。</p>
<p>处治世宜方，处乱世当圆</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>处治世①宜方②，处乱世③当圆④，处叔季之世⑤当方圆并用；待善人宜宽，待恶人宜严，待庸众之人宜宽严互存。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①治世：指和平昌盛、国泰民安的大平盛世。</p>
<p>②方：有棱角，这里指品行端正、坚持原则。</p>
<p>③乱世：不太平的世界，与治世相对。</p>
<p>④圆：没有棱角，圆通应变。</p>
<p>⑤叔季之世：古时长少顺序按伯、仲、叔、季排列，叔季在兄弟中排在最后，比喻末世将乱的时代。据《左传》：“政衰为叔世”，“将亡为季世”。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>处在太平盛世中，为人处世宜坚持原则、刚正不阿。处在纷乱不太平的乱世中，应当圆通机变。处在国家政治衰微，将要走向衰亡纷乱的时候，应当既坚持原则又圆通机变。对待善良的人要宽容厚道，对待坏人要严厉，对待普通人要既严厉又宽容厚道。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>处在太平盛世与处在乱世之中，采用不同的处世原则。当处在国泰民安的太平盛世的时候，需要坚持自己的原则，需要展露自己的棱角，为人处世需要刚正不阿。当处在混乱黑暗的乱世之中时，社会上的秩序规则都被打乱，这时候需要圆通机变，不能还像在繁华盛世中那样棱角分明。因为在乱世中，正常的秩序都被打乱，如果还像从前那样棱角毕现，恐怕会为自己招来杀生之祸。在乱世中，由于不肯变通为自己招来杀生之祸，不仅使自己丢掉生命，而且这种牺牲也于事无补，没有什么价值意义。所以当处在乱世中时，需要学会圆通机变处世。孔子曾经说过“邦有道，不废；邦无道，免于刑戮”，还说“邦有道，则仕；邦无道，则卷而怀之”。也就是说在天下太平，政治清明，政通人和的时候，就出来做官。当天下大乱，政治黑暗的时候，就不要轻易出来做官，要把自己的本领掩藏起来退而归隐。这是对于盛世与乱世的两种不同处世之道。在处在天下将要混乱但是还没有完全混乱的时候，需要方圆并用，既坚持原则、保持棱角，又圆通机变、灵活处事。</p>
<p>对待善良的人要宽容厚道。古人说“投我以桃，报之以李”，对待善良的人，就用宽容善良的态度来回报他们的善意。对待邪恶不善的人要严厉，因为对待恶人善良，就是在无意中促使他们继续为非作歹。对待恶人严厉，才能促使他们悔改。对待普通大众，就需要严厉与宽容交相使用了。</p>
<p>念过而忘功，记恩而忘怨</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>我有功①于人不可念，而过②则不可不念；人有恩于我不可忘，而怨则不可不忘。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①功：对人有恩惠、帮助过别人。</p>
<p>②过：过错，过失。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>我有恩于人，不可以常常放在心上，我做了对不起别人的事情，不可以不放在心上；别人有恩于我，我不能忘记，别人做了对不起我的事情，我不能总是记在心中，要学会忘记。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>我帮助过别人、对别人有功劳，不可以时常放在心上念念不忘。当我做了对不起别人的事情、有愧于人的时候，要时常放在心上。也就是说对待别人，要多想着别人对自己的好，而不要总是想着自己对别人有什么功劳。当自己做了对不住别人的事情，一定不能忘记，要放在心上经常反省，有机会弥补过错就尽量弥补，如果是无可挽回的事情，那么就引以为戒，告诫自己下次不可以再犯这样的错误。别人有对不住自己的地方，不可以过于计较，常想着别人的好处，忘记别人对自己不好的地方。这是一种心胸宽阔的处世之道，体现了人们严于律己、宽以待人的精神。</p>
<p>有一个故事中说要把别人对自己的恩德刻在石头上，永远记在心上，要把别人亏负自己的事情写在沙滩上，使仇怨随风而去。以这样的胸怀处世，能使自己与别人和谐相处，互相之间以礼相待。我国宋朝时候的寇准，为人刚直。当时他在朝廷中受信任的时候，曾经举荐过一个人为官。这个人受过寇准许多恩惠，但是却不知道报恩，反而与寇准为仇，当寇准不得意的时候，他还跟着别人一同打压寇准。后来这个人在朝廷中也失去了权势，当他从京城中流落到外地时，经过寇准的家门口。这个时候寇准已经辞官回家，寇准听说这个人来，还准备了食物送给他。当时寇准的家童们想把此人抓住，狠狠揍一顿，为寇准报仇。寇准知道这件事情后，就把家童们锁在家中，让他们聚赌为乐，不愿意他们出去为自己报仇。寇准的做法体现了他宽容的胸怀，与人交往，不斤斤计较。当别人有负于自己的时候，不总是把仇怨记在心中，该忘记的时候就忘记。这种宽容的处世之道，能使人保持心境轻松，因为记住仇恨也是一件耗费人身心的事情。</p>
<p>为恶畏人知，恶中犹有善</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>为恶而畏人知，恶中犹有善路①；为善而急人知，善处即是恶根②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①善路：通向真善的道路。</p>
<p>②恶根：邪恶、不善的根源。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当一个人做了坏事怕别人知道时，这是在邪恶中还存有改过行善的良知；当一个人做了好事，急着要别人知道这件事情的时候，这就是在做善事中种下了邪恶的种子。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>如果一个人做了坏事，怕别人知道这件事情，那说明这个人还存有良知，心中还有善良的种子。假如一个人做了一件好事，就急着宣扬开，生怕别人不知道，这就是在善念中还存有恶根。孟子认为人性本善，他说人人都有“恻隐之心、羞耻之心、辞让之心、是非之心”，有了这四心，人才成其为人。恻隐之心能够使人对待他人仁爱怜悯。有了羞耻之心，能使人知道礼义廉耻。有辞让之心，能使人知道恭敬谦让。有了是非之心，能使人知道正确选择取舍。</p>
<p>在《智囊》上有这样一个故事，说的是少司马梅衡湘最初担任固安令。固安县中有很多有权势的宦官，他们根本不把县令放在眼中，经常找茬刁难。梅衡湘对他们并不动怒，每次都能很从容地应对。有一次有一个宦官送了猪蹄给梅衡湘，要他给自己追讨欠债。梅衡湘便让人把猪蹄煮熟，备下酒宴招待这位宦官，同时又派人去把那个欠钱不还的人找来。梅衡湘责令这个人还钱，但是此人却哭哭啼啼地说自己不是不想还钱，是因为实在是太穷了，无力偿还欠债。梅衡湘呵斥他们说：“我确实知道你们非常穷，但是无论如何，你也得把欠款还上。你回去或者是卖自己的妻子，或者是把自己的孩子卖掉。我身为父母官又怎么忍心看你们骨肉分离呢，因此暂且宽限你们一天时间，赶紧回家和自己的妻子孩子诀别，这辈子怕是再也见不到了。”梅衡湘这么一说，那欠债的县民哭得更厉害了。这时候那位有权势的宦官也哭了起来，他说自己不要这个人还债了，说完宦官就把借条撕碎了。从此以后，有权势的宦官们在追讨债务的时候，都不再像从前那样严苛了。梅衡湘使宦官亲自看到欠债不还人的悲惨境况，唤起了宦官的同情心，既没有得罪宦官，又使这件事情得到圆满解决。</p>
<p>只逆来顺受，且居安思危</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天之机缄①不测，抑②而伸、伸③而抑，皆是播弄④英雄、颠倒豪杰处。君子只是逆来顺受，居安思危，天亦无所用其伎俩矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①机缄：机，开动。缄，封闭。机缄指机关开闭，推动事物发生变化的力量，也指气数、气运。</p>
<p>②抑：压抑。</p>
<p>③伸：伸展，舒展。</p>
<p>④播弄：玩弄，捉弄。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>上天的机关变化神秘莫测，先使人陷入窘迫中，然后又使人称心如意，或者先使人得意然后又使人遭受挫折。这些都是上天故意摆布捉弄英雄豪杰的地方。一个品德高尚的君子，身处逆境时，坚持不屈不挠，以坚韧忍耐的态度应对挫折困苦，在平安时常想到危难有可能来临。这样上天也对他无可奈何，无法施展玩弄人的伎俩了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个人的命运不仅在于天，更在于自己的所作所为。人能够招来福气，也能远远避开祸害。俗话说的好，不要以为福祸是没有原因的，其实祸福都是人平时种下的种子。每个人的遭遇都不可能相同，每个人对待自己人生中各种机会的态度也不相同。有的人善于抓住机会，把劣势转化为优势，有的人不善于抓住机会，有时甚至会错失良机，使优势变为劣势。</p>
<p>骷髅幻戏图</p>
<p>有一个叫小罗的人，他从家乡来到一个城市里，想找一份工作。小罗的学历不高，也没有丰富的工作经验，想找一份自己比较满意的工作很难。他每天发出大量简历，有的求职信如石沉大海一般没有消息，也有一些回信客气拒绝，说现在暂时不需要招人。小罗坚持不懈，每天都发出许多求职信。有一天他收到一封邮件，邮件的内容也是拒绝，但不是客客气气的那种拒绝，而是用傲慢的措辞贬低小罗。邮件里说小罗的英文求职信有好多错误，说小罗表现得很笨拙。看了这封邮件，小罗气得发狂，他第一次遇到这种情况。他想你们可以拒绝我，但是你们不应该侮辱我。按照常理，用人单位不会发这样的傲慢无礼的邮件给求职者。小罗愤怒之下，立刻写了一封回复邮件，狠狠地回击这家无礼的公司。当饱含小罗愤怒情绪的邮件写完之后，却没有把它发出去。他冷静下来想自己的英文水平确实有待于提高，自己对这家公司确实不够了解就轻率地给他们发去求职信。这样仔细思考过后，小罗把这封骂人的邮件删除了。他重新写了一封信给这家公司，在信中态度诚恳地指出自己的不足之处，并表示自己要苦学英文。小罗还在尽可能详细搜寻这家公司信息的前提下，阐述了自己对这家公司主要业务的见解。小罗发出这封邮件后，不久就收到了回信，公司的主管邀请他去面谈。小罗去了，得到了一份自己比较满意的工作。小罗善于抓住机会，使劣势转化为优势，从而使自己成功获得一份较满意工作。</p>
<p>宁守默毋躁，宁守拙毋巧</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>十语九中，未必称奇。一语不中，则愆尤①骈集②；十谋九成，未必归功。一谋不成，则訾议③丛兴。君子所以宁默毋躁，宁拙毋巧。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①愆尤：过失，罪过。愆，罪过、过失。尤，过失、责怪、怨恨。</p>
<p>②骈集：凑集、集合，接连而至。骈，两物并列、成双。</p>
<p>③訾议：议论、指责别人。訾，诋毁、指责。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>十句话中有九句说对了，未必有人称赞，一句话说错了，各种指责就纷纷到来；十次计谋中有九次成功，也未必会使人觉得你有功劳，一个计谋失败，那么各种非议责难也就接连而至。所以君子宁可静默而不愿意冲动急躁，宁可笨拙一些也不自作聪明。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>聪明是好事，但是显得太聪明就不是明智的做法了。子路打扮得整洁漂亮来见孔子，孔子对子路说：“仲由你这样衣饰光鲜，是为什么呢？你脸上显出自得的样子，谁还会来劝诫你呢？把聪明都写在自己脸上的人，处处表现出自己很能干的样子，这是小人。对于君子而言，知道就说知道，不知道就说不知道。有的话可以说，有的话不能说。说话要掌握要领，这就是明智。”也就是说，人不可以使自己表现得过于聪明。在现代社会中，真正的聪明不会惹起别人的反感，只有那些处处表现出自己很能干，遇到每件事情都要显得自己比别人高明，显示自己高人一等的人，这样的人会招来大家的厌恶。所以真正有智慧的人，懂得敛藏自己的才华智巧。</p>
<p>宋朝时候，曹玮在关中很长时间了，他请求朝廷派人来接替他。宋真宗问王旦说：“谁可以代替曹玮呢？”王旦举荐了李及。皇上同意了任用李及。众大臣们对此却有所怀疑，因为李及为人确实谨慎忠厚，行为检点，但是他却不是一个能够守卫边塞的人才。韩亿把大臣们的疑惑告诉了王旦，王旦没有说什么。后来李及到了秦州，将吏都轻视他。有一次，有一个士兵在大白天抢夺一个妇人头上的银钗，被有关官吏抓获，押来禀告李及。当时李及正在看书，命人把士兵带上前来，审问清楚。这个士兵认罪。李及当即命令把这个士兵处斩，然后继续看书。将吏对此又吃惊又佩服，从此不敢再轻视李及。这件事情传到京城，韩亿听说后，就又来见王旦，把这件事情详细讲述给王旦，并且称赞王旦善识人才。王旦笑说：“士卒当强盗，主将把他处斩，这是很平常的事情，有什么奇怪的？我之所以举荐李及，不是因为这个缘故，而是由于曹玮治理秦州已七年，羌人都敬服他。曹玮已经把边塞的事处置得非常妥当，如果换一个人去，必然会自作聪明，擅自改变，这样一来就把曹玮已经取得的政绩都破坏了。派李及去，正是因为李及忠厚稳重，必然会保持曹玮所开创的局面而已。”韩亿听了，为王旦的见识不凡佩服不已。可见聪明是好事，但是有时候需要学会敛藏自己的聪明。</p>
<p>不责人小过，不发人阴私</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>不责人小过①，不发②人阴私③，不念人旧恶④；三者可以养德⑤，亦可以远害。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①过：过错，失误。</p>
<p>②发：揭露，揭发。</p>
<p>③阴私：即隐私，生活中隐秘的事情。</p>
<p>④旧恶：指从前的过错与失误。</p>
<p>⑤养德：培养道德。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不责怪别人的小过错，不揭发别人的隐私，不对别人从前的错误念念不忘；这样做既可以培养我们的道德品行，又可以使我们躲开祸患。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>为人处世不能过于计较，对待别人需要有宽厚包容的精神。现实生活中不存在至善至美的完人，即使是非常杰出优秀的人都或多或少存在一些缺点。因此我们对待别人不可以求全责备，有时候别人有小的过失，能忘就尽量忘掉。揭发别人隐私，是小人的做法。在现实生活中，对他人隐私的尊重，也是对自己隐私的尊重。别人从前犯下的错误，时隔日久，也就不必总是提起。总是记得别人的过失，对于自己毫无益处，反而有损害。</p>
<p>汉朝人丙吉当丞相的时候，有一个为他驾车的人喜欢喝酒。有一次丙吉出门，这个车夫喝醉了，呕吐在丙吉的车上。西曹主吏把这件事告诉丙吉，想把这个车夫赶走。丙吉制止了他。丙吉说：“因为他喝醉后的一点小过失把他赶走，让他到哪里去谋生呢？西曹你暂且忍一忍吧，这也不过是弄脏了车中坐垫而已。”后来边疆有事，车夫看到传递军书的人赶到京城，就把这件事情禀告丙吉，并且为丙吉提了很多有价值的建议。当皇帝召见丙吉商议事情的时候，丙吉因为有所准备，所以得到了皇帝的嘉奖。宋朝时候郭进担任山西巡检，有一个军官进京告状。经调查后，证明这个军官对郭进的控告是诬告，于是这个军官被遣送回山西，由郭进处置。郭进对这个人说；“你敢诬告我，这也说明你有胆量。如今我赦免你的罪，如果你能杀敌，我就把你举荐给朝廷。如果你失败了，就投河自尽吧，也不要弄脏了我的宝剑。”这个军官奋不顾身，勇猛杀敌，终于大获全胜。郭进也确实遵守诺言，向朝廷举荐了他，使他升了官。容忍别人的小过错，结果获得了大回报，善待别人也是善待自己。</p>
<p>直节使人忌，无恶致人毁</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>曲意①而使人喜，不若直节②而使人忌；无善而致人誉，不如无恶而致人毁。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①曲意：委屈自己的意志。违背自己的意愿。</p>
<p>②直节：刚正不阿。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>违背自己的意愿，刻意去讨好别人，不如刚直不阿使别人忌恨；没有善行却无故得到别人的赞美，不如没有过错却遭到别人的毁谤。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>违背自己的意愿去讨好别人，还不如保持自己刚正不阿的节操，即使招来别人的忌恨，也好过刻意奉承讨好别人。自己并没有做过善事，却无缘无故得到别人的赞美，这种赞美恐怕有一定目的。俗话说“无事献殷勤，非奸即盗”，别人无缘无故地赞美你，说你的好话，很可能是想利用你达到一定目的。因此无故得到别人的赞美还不如无故惹来别人毁谤更令人心安。</p>
<p>在生活中，如果我们为了使别人高兴，而总是违背自己的意愿，服从于他人的意愿，这样不仅会使自己活得很累，而且使自己变得没有主见，丧失了自己的独立人格。对待他人应当谦虚有礼，但是在必要的时候还是需要坚持自己的原则，能够拒绝别人，坚持自己的意见。有一个故事，说的是有一个人，他从来都不会拒绝别人的要求，所以他自己生活得非常累。后来有一天，他终于下决心坚持自己，在遇到和别人意见不一致的时候，坚持自己的意见立场。后来他发现坚持自己的原则，并没有使他失去朋友，相反还使他交到一些真正的好朋友。所以我们在生活中，不需要刻意去违背自己的意愿讨好别人。</p>
<p>宋朝时候丞相富弼，有一次别人告诉他说有人骂你，他回答说可能是在骂别人吧。报告的那人又说那个人确实在骂你，因为他是指名道姓地骂人。富弼说他可能是在骂与我同名同姓的人。这种笑骂由人、不和人计较的胸怀，使得富弼的人格品质相形之下比那个骂人的人高出许多。如果自己确实没有做什么不可告人的事情，那么又何必在意别人讲自己的是非。只要这种是非没有造成严重危害，那么就由他去，日久自然见人心。</p>
<p>毋偏信自任，毋炫耀忌能</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>毋偏信①，而为奸所欺；毋自任②，而为气③所使；毋以己之长，而形④人之短；毋因己之拙，而忌⑤人之能。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①偏信：只相信一方，不全面了解问题。</p>
<p>②自任：过于自信，刚愎自用。</p>
<p>③气：一时意气。</p>
<p>④形：对比，衬托。</p>
<p>⑤忌：嫉妒，畏惧。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不要相信别人的片面之词，要全面了解问题，以避免被奸诈小人欺骗；不要过于相信自己的能力，以避免被一时意气所支使；不要用自己的长处去衬托别人的短处；不要因为自己的笨拙而去嫉妒憎恶别人的才干。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>没有全面了解问题，听信别人的片面之词，最终会被奸诈的人所欺骗。所以在生活中，我们看问题不可以片面，应该全面了解问题，掌握真实情况，这样才不至于被奸诈的人欺骗。我们常听到一句话“没有调查就没有发言权”，毛泽东在革命年代就提出调查研究的重要性，时至今日，人们已深知调查研究的重要性。只是理论上的知道还需要落实到行动中，在实践行动中善于调查，全面了解问题，以便获知真相。这样做能够使我们了解事情真相，不至于被人蒙骗，不至于听到片面之词就轻易相信，最终落入奸诈之人的圈套中。</p>
<p>刘邦与项羽争夺天下，当时项羽有一位足智多谋的军师范增。范增很有才干，是一位劲敌，刘邦很想除掉他。刘邦手下陈平献了一条反间计，使刘邦拿出大量金银，收买项羽的人，让这些人在项羽营中散布谣言。谣言说范增与汉王刘邦有勾结。项羽派使者去刘邦那里，刘邦故意让人优待范增的使者，怠慢项羽的使者，表现出与范增有交情的样子。范增是不是真的与刘邦有勾结，项羽没有仔细调查，他片面地相信范增与刘邦有交往，于是就剥夺了范增的权力。范增气得大骂，返乡途中，旧病复发死在途中。项羽片面看问题，落人刘邦的圈套之中，失去范增加速了他的失败。</p>
<p>自信是好事，现在社会中需要自信的人，在激烈的社会竞争中，时刻保持着自信心积极应对挑战，这是一种积极健康的人生态度。如果过于自信，对自己的能力估计过于高，遇到事情偏执任性以致于意气用事，这就不可取了。自信的人往往确实有才干，有才干的人有时候会犯炫耀自己才干的错误。因为自己擅长某事，就拿出来炫耀，以此来衬托别人的短处，这样做非常容易引起别人的怨恨。真正德才兼备的人是不会这样做的，俗话说“尺有所长，寸有所短”，大千世界中每个人都有自己的特点。有些人可能擅长于某事，有些人可能不擅长于某事。自己擅长的正好是别人不擅长的，那也没什么可以骄傲的，因为别人擅长的也有可能正是自己的短处。正如一个故事中所讲的那样，有一个人学了很多东西，知识丰富。他去乘船，在船上问船夫：你懂得数学吗？你懂的物理学吗？你了解莎士比亚吗？他一连串问了船夫很多问题。船夫停止划船，一阵风浪，掌握了丰富知识的乘船人掉下水去。船夫把他捞上来后说：你说的那些我都不会，可是你会划船吗？你会游泳吗？这个故事说明每个人都有自己擅长的与不擅长的，没有必要为自己擅长的沾沾自喜。真正自信的人，不会因为别人比自己强就去嫉妒仇恨别人。遇到各方面能力都比自己强，才干超过自己的人，能够真心欣赏对方，这是一种真正自信的表现。</p>

<p>且莫轻输心，应须谨防口</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>遇沉沉①不语之士，且莫输心②；见悻悻③自好之人，应须防口。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①沉沉：表情阴郁的样子。</p>
<p>②输心：付出真心。</p>
<p>③悻悻：怨恨失意的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>遇到表情阴郁不喜欢说话的人，不要轻易对他付出真心；遇到怨天尤人而又自以为是的人，要小心谨慎不和他说太多的话。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在和别人相处的时候，也需要谨慎辨别，不能毫无区别地一视同仁。遇到那些表情阴郁、心思沉重的人，还是不要轻易和他推心置腹的好。遇到那些自以为了不起，喜欢指天骂地的人，还是和他们保持一定距离比较好。和品质优良的人交往，自己受其影响，也能变得优秀起来。俗话说“物以类聚，人以群分”，对于朋友不能不谨慎选择。选择与那些优秀的人交往，自己也能逐渐受其影响变得优秀起来。如果与那些不善良的人交往，天长日久，恐怕就会受到坏的影响。</p>
<p>孔子曾经对他的弟子们说：“当我死之后，恐怕子夏将会日益长进，而子贡将会日益退步。”曾参就问孔子为何如此说。孔子说：“子夏喜欢和比自己强的人交往，而子贡只喜欢与不如自己的人交往。不了解儿子的可以看他父亲如何，从父亲的为人中也就能看出儿子品行如何。不了解这个人品行如何时，可以通过观察了解这个人的朋友，了解了他的朋友品行如何，也就对这个人的品行有所了解了。不知道某国的国君如何，可以对这个国家派出的使臣进行观察了解，当了解了这个使臣时也就能够对他们国家的国君形成一定的认识了。不了解某块土地如何，可以通过对这里生长的草木如何来认识这块土地。和品质优良的人相处，就像是进入生长着香草的地方，时间久了闻不到香草的香味，因为自己已经被芝兰等香草浸染了。和品行不端的人相处，就好比走进腥臭的地方，时间一长就闻不到臭味了，因为自己已经被臭味浸染了。藏丹的地方是红的，藏漆的地方是黑的。君子一定要谨慎选择和自己交往的人。”选择交往对象，一定要非常慎重，因为朋友对于自己的品行节操以及世界观、认识观、价值观等都有非常重要的影响。</p>
<p>戒疏于虑者，警伤于察者</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无，此戒疏①于虑者；宁受人之欺，毋逆②人之诈，此警伤于察③者。二语并存，精明浑厚矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①疏：疏忽。</p>
<p>②逆：事先揣测。</p>
<p>③察！观察，这里指过于谨慎小心。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>“害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无”这句箴言是用来劝诫那些在和别人交往时不够细心、警觉性不够、对别人没有防范之心的人。“宁可受到别人的欺骗，也不过于精细对别人处处防范”，这句话是用来劝诫那些过于精细、对别人防范之心过多的人。这两句箴言并用，能使人既精明谨慎又浑厚纯朴。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>现实生活中，有些人过于精细，有些人又过于马虎。在和别人交往的时候，既不能过于精细也不能过于马虎。做事情要不偏不倚，既要精明谨慎，又要纯朴善良。对于那些心地善良，自己从不做损人利己的事情，而且认为别人也不会包藏祸心的人，他们需要的是对别人存有几分防范之心。自己不害人，不等于别人就不会利用祸害你，所以在和别人交往相处的时候，不能一味没有原则地信任别人，需要对别人存有几分防范之心。对于那些疑心过重的人，他们的主要毛病不在于对别人没有防范之心，而是在于对于别人的防范之心过于严重。疑心病重，总是怀疑别人对自己包藏祸心，不仅使自己生活得很累，而且还容易将好人当做坏人，以致于是非不分、好坏不分，伤害别人的信任。把两者结合起来，既对别人存有一定防范之心，同时又不过于精细谨慎，这样就可以避免“疏于虑者”与“伤于察者”在为人处世方面的不足了。</p>
<p>唐朝时候，安禄山在没有叛乱之前，装扮出忠厚纯朴的样子，骗取唐玄宗的信任。有人对唐玄宗说安禄山其实不老实，唐玄宗却认为那人胡说。到后来，安禄山举旗造反，唐玄宗才发现自己信任错了人。三国时候的曹操，他疑心病极重，当他患上头疼病，名医华佗为他治病。华佗对曹操说我现在的治疗方法，只能使您暂时止住疼痛，如果想要除去病根，就需要把头用斧子劈开。曹操一听大怒，认为华佗想害自己，于是下令把华佗抓起来处死。华佗死后，曹操的头疼病又犯了，却再无人可以为他治疗。曹操就是疑心病过重，对于别人防范过严的人，最终他只能自食恶果。</p>
<p>毋私小伤大，毋借公快私</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>毋因群疑而阻独见，毋任己意而废人言；毋私小惠而伤大体，毋借公论以快①私情。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①快：快乐，快意。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不要因为大家都表示怀疑就放弃自己正确的意见，不要一意孤行不听别人的意见；不要为了自己利益而对别人施以小恩小惠伤害大家利益，不要因为自己的私人恩怨而借着社会公众舆论来发泄自己的不满情绪。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>宋太祖赵匡胤对于公与私分得很清楚。他在没有当上皇帝的时候，在周朝为臣。有一次，他在淮南镇守滁州城，他的父亲在半夜里叫人开城门。赵匡胤站在城楼上对他的父亲说：“父子虽然是亲人，但是城门关闭与开启，需要遵守王命。”他的父亲没有办法，只好等到第二天早上才进了城。还有一次南唐使用反间计，送给赵匡胤许多金银，赵匡胤把这些金银全部都交给了朝廷内府，为此周世宗对他特别信任与器重。</p>
<p>商鞅曾为魏国丞相公孙痤门下的食客。公孙痤生病时，魏惠王来探视他。公孙痤说商鞅是个人才，向魏惠王推荐商鞅。魏惠王没有说什么。公孙痤又说如果大王不准备任用商鞅，那就得把他杀掉，不能让他到别的国家去为别国效力。魏惠王同意了。等到魏惠王走后，公孙痤对商鞅说：“我向大王举荐你，他没有答应。我就说如果不任用你，就要把你杀掉，他同意了。你赶紧逃命去吧。”于是商鞅逃到秦国，成就了一番事业。商鞅是公孙痤的朋友，公孙痤为了公事，向魏惠王建议如果不用商鞅就杀掉他，这是不以私废公的做法。同时公孙痤又把这件事情告诉商鞅，顾全了友谊。在公与私的问题上，不能以私废公。</p>
<p>在遇到问题需要进行抉择判断的时候，既需要听取别人的意见，同时也不能因为大家与自己的意见不同，就放弃自己的正确意见。有时候多数人的意见是正确的，但是也有一些时候多数人的意见不一定是正确的。如果一意孤行根本听不见别人的劝告，那么必然办不好事情。三国时候蜀国的丞相诸葛亮，任用马谡镇守街亭。街亭是重地，如果街亭失陷，那么整个蜀国就陷入危险之中。马谡这个人确实博览群书，有一定才华，但是却有些华而不实。他可以将事情分析得头头是道，却缺乏实践经验。诸葛亮和马谡相对交谈，马谡所言令诸葛亮对他比较赏识，但是当马谡在镇守街亭的时候，真正实践起来，他刚愎自用，一意孤行，不肯听取别人的劝诫，最终使得街亭失守。由此可见，我们既需要坚持自己的正确意见，同时也要善于听取别人有价值的建议。</p>
<p>亲善不预扬，去恶不先发</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>善人未能急亲①，不宜预扬②，恐来谗谮③之奸；恶人未能轻去，不宜先发，恐招媒孽④之祸。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①急亲：迫切和人亲近。</p>
<p>②预扬：预先赞扬。</p>
<p>③谗谮：恶意中伤与诽谤。</p>
<p>④媒孽：制造事端诬陷陷害别人。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>遇到善良有德行的人不要迫切和他亲近结交，也不要预先赞扬他的美德。预先赞美他的美德恐怕会为他招来恶意的诽谤与中伤。和品行不端的人绝交，不能草率行事，也不能事先宣扬，以此来避免祸患。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>多和有德行的人交往，能使自己的德行也得到提高。遇到品行不端的人，要和他保持一定距离。在听说一个有德行的人时，不要急切地和他交往，因为这样做有可能会引起别人的嫉恨。春秋时期，百里奚是饱学之士，他才识过人，却由于家境贫寒不得已在虢国当大夫谋生。后来虢国被晋国消灭，百里奚不愿意为晋国效力，被晋国当成下人使用。后来穆姬要嫁到秦国去，百里奚成了穆姬的陪嫁侍从。百里奚在去秦国的路上逃走，逃到楚国。楚成王听说百里奚善于饲养牛羊，就让百里奚为自己放牛。秦穆公在看到晋国陪嫁侍从名单中有百里奚，但是没有看到百里奚这个人，后来听说百里奚有才干，就想把百里奚要回来。他本打算重金赎回百里奚，但是公子絷劝诫他说：“大王这样做，不是等于告诉楚成王百里奚是一个人才吗？楚成王不知道百里奚的才干，才会让百里奚放牛。如果楚成王知道百里奚是一个人才，他恐怕会把百里奚留下来。”秦穆公说：“那我们该如何做才能得到百里奚？”公子絷回答说：“大王只需要向楚成王追讨逃亡的奴隶，用一个奴隶的价格把百里奚换回来，楚王就不会怀疑了。”百里奚来到秦国后，辅佐秦王成就了一番事业。秦国想得到百里奚，却不能事先把这件事情宣扬出去。因为如果事先宣扬了百里奚是一位有才干的人才，恐怕会引来别人的嫉妒与阻挠。</p>
<p>功过不可混，恩仇勿太明</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>功过不宜少混，混则人怀惰隳①之心；恩仇不可太明，明则起携贰②之志。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①惰隳：心灰意懒，堕落不振。</p>
<p>②携贰：心怀贰心。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>功劳与过错不能有丝毫的混淆，如果混淆功劳与过错，就会使人灰心丧气、不愿意再勤奋努力；恩惠和仇恨不能表现得过于明显，如果表现得过于明显，就会使人产生怀疑猜忌之心而兴起反叛的想法。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>汉光武帝刘秀起兵消灭了起兵称帝的王朗，在王朗宫中收缴了大批文书信件。其中有不少信件是各地官员写给王朗的，信中说了许多刘秀的坏话。此时写过信的人不由得惴惴不安，恐怕大祸就要临头。但是刘秀对于这些书信并不拆开来看，当着大家的面，他把这些书信全部投入火中。刘秀说：“胜者为王败者为寇，在当时情形下，我与王朗谁胜谁负还不知道，人们以求自保也是可以理解的。过去的事情又何必再追究呢？”刘秀这种做法，使很多人对他倾佩不已，因而也为他赢得了更多的支持者。后来在官渡之战中，曹操获胜，在袁绍的大营中搜出来大量文件。其中有一些是曹营中人和袁绍联系的书信。曹操效法汉光武帝刘秀在破邯郸城后的做法，命令不得拆阅这些书信，把这些书信统统烧毁。还说：“危急时刻，谁的心中不会产生动摇？”于是军心得以大定。恩仇不能太分明，太分明就不足以收服人心。刘秀与曹操这种不计旧仇的做法，为他们赢得了人心。</p>
<p>恩仇不能太分明，功劳与过错却不能混淆。混淆功劳与过错，赏罚不分明，这样会使积极努力的人心灰意懒，丧失继续努力与积极进取的动力。混淆功过，还会使那些懒惰懈怠、不思进取的人变得更加懒惰，更加不思进取，得过且过。现代社会中，无论是公司企业还是事业单位，现在都讲求建立有效的赏罚措施，这样可以激励员工们积极努力，发挥自身最大的潜力。</p>

<p>恶显者祸浅，善显者功小</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>恶忌阴①，善忌阳②。故恶之显者祸浅，而隐者祸深；善之显者功小，而隐者功大。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①阴：指事物的背面，不露出表面的、暗中的。</p>
<p>②阳：指事物的正面，外露的、明显的。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当一个人做了坏事，最怕的是把这件事情隐瞒起来。当一个人做了好事，最怕的是把这件事情宣扬出去。所以坏事被大家及早发现的，坏事所能造成的坏影响就小。如果坏事隐藏得很深，不被大家发现，那么坏事造成的祸害就很多。一个人做了好事到处宣扬，那么这件好事的价值就会变小。一个人做了好事并不宣扬自己，这件好事的价值就会更大一些。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有一首诗曰：“周公恐惧流言日，王莽谦恭未篡时。向使当初身便死，一生真伪复谁知。”王莽在没有篡夺王位的时候，谦恭谨慎，把自己的阴谋祸心都深深掩藏起来。王莽随着母亲住在宫中，他城府深不可测，生活极其朴素，爱好读书学习。他尽心尽力地侍奉母亲和寡妇嫂子，抚养已去世的兄长留下来的儿子。他对待有才干的人，非常谦虚有礼。他对待自己的叔伯长辈们，十分用心侍奉。他的大伯父王凤，是军队中职位最高的。当王凤生病的时候，王莽日夜在王凤床前服侍。他衣不解带，不辞劳苦地看护王凤，亲自尝试汤药，头不梳脸不洗，不离开王凤床前半步。王凤为之感动，认为王莽是可靠之人。当王凤临死前，向皇太后王政君与皇帝刘骜举荐了王莽。王莽被升为射声校尉，成为北军指挥官之一。王莽不仅赢得了王凤的信任，他还赢得了五叔王商的信任。王商也举荐王莽，为王莽说好话。这样一来，不久王莽就被授予骑都尉、光禄大夫、侍中等官职，得到了朝廷的信任与重用。王莽一直把自己的阴谋祸心隐藏起来，到他真正掌握实权之后，他的阴谋祸心才开始逐渐显露出来。</p>
<p>他开始打击有可能对自己造成威胁的大臣。当汉哀帝刘欣去世后，王莽把大权掌握在自己手中，招揽笼络人心，铲除异己。后来王莽毒死汉平帝，立刘婴为帝。又过了两年之后，王莽废了皇帝，自己当上了皇帝。王莽的真实面目这才暴露在众人面前，只是此时王莽羽翼丰满，再铲除他已经来不及了。由此可见，隐藏的恶所造成的危害更大，因为会使人们疏于防范。</p>
<p>贫不能济物，出言亦助人</p>

<p>注释</p>
<p>①士君子：有学问且品德高尚的人。</p>
<p>②济物：用财物救济别人。</p>
<p>③痴迷：迷惑不解。</p>
<p>④功德：功业与德行。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>士君子们由于贫穷不能用财物救济帮助别人，当别人遇到问题不知道该怎么办的时候，从旁边指点提醒他；当别人遇到困难的时候，说几句话解救他，这也是很大的功德了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>春秋时代，晏子辅佐齐景公，他时常找机会劝诫齐景公。齐景公喜欢打猎，他养了老鹰用于捕捉兔子。有一天负责饲养老鹰的烛邹把齐景公的老鹰给丢了。这下子齐景公勃然大怒，要派人杀掉烛邹。晏子听说这件事情，赶忙赶来拜见齐景公。他对齐景公说：“大王，烛邹有几大罪状，等我宣布他的罪状之后您再杀掉他。”齐景公答应了。于是晏子便宣布烛邹的罪状，他说：“你替大王喂养老鹰却不谨慎让老鹰跑掉，这是你的第一大罪状；你使得我们的大王为了一只老鹰杀掉一个人，这是你的第二大罪状；杀掉你之后，使天下人以为我们的大王是看重禽类轻视人才的昏庸之辈，这是你的第三大罪状。”晏子说完，就请齐景公把烛邹杀掉，这时候齐景公说：“不要杀烛邹，我已经明白丞相的意思了。”晏子通过巧妙的方式，既劝诫了齐景公，又救了烛邹的命。在别人危难的时刻，为他说几句好话解救他的急难，这也是一种帮助他人，为自己积攒功德的做法。</p>
<p>三国时候，荆州牧刘表偏爱自己的小儿子刘琮。他的大儿子刘琦怕自己遭到后母等人陷害，于是向诸葛亮请教自保的方法。最开始，诸葛亮不肯管别人家事。刘琦想出一个办法，他假意请诸葛亮上楼饮酒，等到诸葛亮上楼之后，他又派人把梯子撤掉。刘琦说：“现在先生说的话只有天知地知你知我知了，您可以教我自保之术了吧？”于是诸葛亮说：“君不见申生在内而危，重耳在外而安乎？”诸葛亮举春秋时期晋文公重耳自保的例子，建议刘琦远走避祸。刘琦采纳诸葛亮的建议，任江夏太守，避开了后母等人。</p>
<p>作人须真恳，涉世须圆活</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>作人无一点真恳的念头，便成个花子①，事事皆虚；涉世无一段圆活②的机趣，便是个木人，处处有碍。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①花子：乞丐。</p>
<p>②圆活：灵活机变。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>作人没有一点真心实意，就会变成像什么都没有的乞丐一样，无论做什么事情都是虚浮不实；经历世事没有一点灵活机变，就像是一个没有生命的木头人一样呆头呆脑，无论做什么事情都会遇到障碍。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>商鞅为秦王拟定变法条令，为了使百姓相信，他想出了一个办法。他令人在秦国国都南门处竖起一根柱子，诏告天下，说谁能把这根木头移到北城门，就赏给这个人十金。百姓疑惑不解，不敢相信真会有奖赏，因此没有人搬动木头。后来商鞅又下令把奖金提高，终于有一个人出来把木头搬到了北门。商鞅遵守承诺，命人按照承诺的数额给了这个奖赏。商鞅这一举动，获得了百姓的信任，对于变法的顺利颁布执行起到了很好的促进作用。</p>
<p>华歆和王朗乘船避难，这时候有一个人想跟着他们同行。华歆感到为难，王朗说：“船这么大，多他一个人也没什么关系。”后来追兵赶到，王朗就想把这个搭船人推下去。华歆说：“我之前之所以犹豫，就是因为考虑到危难时的事情。只是既然我们已经答应他上船，怎么可以在紧急的时候就把他抛弃掉呢？”于是就带着这个搭船人一起逃跑了。</p>
<p>孔子住在陈国，后来离开陈国，经过蒲地的时候，正赶上了公叔氏在蒲地叛乱。蒲人拦住孔子等人，对孔子等人说：“如果你们答应不去卫国，我们就把你们放了。”于是孔子表示不会去卫国，这些人就把孔子放了。孔子离开蒲地后就前往卫国，子贡说：“先生怎么可以不守信呢？”孔子回答说：“在受人胁迫的时候立下的盟约，是可以不必遵守的。神明们是不会听这种盟约的。”</p>
<p>作人需要诚恳真实，答应了别人的事情就要做到，如果做不到就不要答应下来。商鞅通过遵守承诺来取信于民。华歆的做法显然比王朗更显出君子的德行。涉世之中需要有灵活变通的意识，孔子在受到蒲地人威胁时立下盟约，这种盟约是不必遵守的。既要真诚待人，遵守诺言，又要灵活机变，不拘泥于自己曾经说过的话。</p>
<p>恩自淡而浓，威自严而宽</p>

<p>恩宜自淡而浓，先浓后淡者，人忘其惠；威①宜自严而宽，先宽后严者，人怨其酷。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①威：威风，威严。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>施恩于他人，适宜于从淡到浓，逐渐增多。如果先浓后淡，先给别人大的恩惠，后来又逐渐减少，人们就会忘记你曾经给他们的恩惠。威严适宜于从严厉到宽舒，如果先宽松后严厉，人们就会埋怨你的严苛。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>三国时候的蜀国丞相诸葛亮，在南方蛮夷作乱之时，率领大军征伐他们。经过双方交战，蜀国大军大获全胜。诸葛亮在平定南方之后，就任用当地部族的首领为官，由他们来治理这个地方。有人表示不理解，劝说诸葛亮说：“丞相您威震四方，蛮夷都来归降。只是这些人过于善变，今天归降，也许明天又会叛乱。何不趁他们归降的机会，在此地设立汉人官吏治理这个地方，由此可以使这些蛮夷逐渐接受汉人的教化，逐渐被熏陶同化为懂得礼仪廉耻的良民，这是一个大好的机会啊。”诸葛亮说：“设立汉人官吏确实有其好处，只是这样一来，就需要把军队留下。军队留下来却没有军粮，这是第一个麻烦。此地人刚刚经历了战争混乱，父亲兄弟等亲人丧生，如果只设立汉人官吏却没有军队在此镇守，必然会惹起祸端。这是第二个麻烦。况且蛮夷之人屡屡有废立争夺的事情发生，他们相互之间也有很多矛盾猜疑，如果设立汉人官吏，恐怕更不能获得他们的信任，这是第三个麻烦。现在我不在这个地方留军队，也不运粮食，使此地获得平定，蛮夷与汉人必和谐相处、平安无事。”后来诸葛亮在世时，蛮夷果然没有再反叛。诸葛亮先率领大军征伐，接下来又对蛮夷实行宽松的政策，于是得到了蛮夷的归降。这是先严后宽的做法，如果一开始对蛮夷处处忍让，恐怕不能很好地收服蛮夷。</p>
<p>休与小人仇，休向君子媚</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>休与小人仇雠①，小人自有对头；休向君子谄媚，君子原无私惠。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①仇雠：仇人，结仇。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不要和小人结仇，小人自然会遇到对付他的人；不要奉承讨好君子，君子本来就是公正无私的。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“宁得罪君子，勿得罪小人”，得罪了君子，君子不会在背后使奸害人，但是得罪了小人的话，说不定哪天就被小人陷害。所以对于小人，最好采取敬而远之的态度，不要和他们结为仇敌。明朝时候王守仁捉拿到反叛的朱宸濠后，江彬等人才到来。江彬性情狡黠，很会奉承讨好皇上。江彬散播流言诬陷中伤王守仁。王守仁对此并不在意。第一次见面，江彬让人把座位设立在旁边，让王守仁坐在那里。王守仁假装不明白，径直坐在上座，把其他人的座位移到下首。江彬等人立刻口出恶言，王守仁平心静气地把交际礼仪解释给他们听。这时候又有别人为王守仁解释，江彬等人的怒气才平息下来。王守仁这么做并不是在争夺座位，只不过是因为一旦受到江彬等人的牵制，那么以后每件事都要受到他们的钳制了，那样就做不成什么事情了。王守仁既不与江彬等人结仇，又坚持了自己的原则，这种做事方法值得我们学习。</p>
<p>还有一次，有几个宦官与叛党有勾结，当叛党被消灭之后，王守仁掌握了这几个宦官的罪证。但是王守仁并没有把这件事情报告给朝廷，他在见到宦官的时候，把这件事情告诉了宦官们。这几个宦官对王守仁非常感激。后来当王守仁遇到事情的时候，他们还为王守仁出过力。这也是王守仁不得罪小人，为自己攒下的人缘。对于君子不需要采取谄媚讨好的举动，因为君子做事情讲求的是道义，而不是结党营私。无论与君子私人交情如何，君子都会秉公办事，不会为自己的私情而损害公正。</p>

<p>用人不宜刻，交友不宜滥</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>用人不宜刻①，刻则思效者去；交友不宜滥②，滥则贡谀③者来。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①刻：苛刻，严苛。</p>
<p>②滥：不加选择，轻率随便。</p>
<p>③贡谀：阿谀奉承。贡，贡献。谀，阿谀奉承。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>用人不能太苛刻，如果太苛刻就会使那些想为你效力的人纷纷离去；交朋友不能毫无选择地随便乱交，如果对朋友不加选择，那么就会招来阿谀奉承之辈。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>用人不能太苛刻，如果太苛刻的话，就不能使人真心为你效力。亚洲首富李嘉诚在谈及自己的用人经验时曾经说过，对待自己的手下员工要讲求宽严适度。如果对他们过于严厉，就不能使员工们真心为公司出力。当员工们对公司有所贡献时，李嘉诚是毫不吝惜给他们奖励的。李嘉诚还说当自己赚到了钱，一定会分一些给员工们，有利大家同享，他不会一个人把所有利益据为己有。当员工们犯了错误的时候，要对他们进行批评，但是当员工们犯了大错误的时候，可以对他们进行适当的鼓励。因为当员工犯了大错的时候，他自己也会惴惴不安，所以这个时候不需要再对他们进行责罚了，应当对他们进行适当的安抚。李嘉诚坚持自己的用人原则，使他带出来一支精明强干的队伍。</p>
<p>交朋友需要慎重，如果不加选择地交朋友，很可能会交到不良损友。有一个故事，说的是有一个女孩，她在上大学之前品学优良。但是当她上大学之后，交到了不良的朋友。她的朋友们喜欢玩乐。有一次女孩和这帮人一起出去玩，在麻将桌上，这帮人引诱女孩吸烟，女孩接过烟抽了几口，感觉非常好，于是把这支烟全抽完了。后来她才发现，自己抽的烟其实是毒品，等她明白过来的时候已经染上了毒瘾。这就是交友不慎为自己带来的恶果。所以在选择来往对象的时候，需要十分慎重。</p>
<p>朴鲁胜练达，疏狂胜曲谨</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>涉世①浅点染②亦浅，历事深机械③亦深。故君子与其练达，不若朴鲁④；与其曲谨⑤，不若疏狂⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①涉世：经历世事。</p>
<p>②点染：浸染，熏染。这里指人们受社会风气影响。</p>
<p>③机械：这里指人的心机与城府。</p>
<p>④朴鲁：朴实，鲁莽。</p>
<p>⑤曲谨：谨慎小心。</p>
<p>⑥疏狂：不拘小节，豪放不羁。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个经历世事不深的人，受到社会不良风气的浸染也就少。在社会上阅历丰富的人，经过的事情多了，城府心机也就变得深重了。所以说君子与其圆滑练达地处世，还不如保持自己纯朴的本质；与其处处谨慎小心，还不如豁达豪放一些。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在社会中时间一长，人就容易受到社会风气的浸染。一个阅历丰富的人，经历的事情多了，不知不觉中就会变得城府深了起来。其实心机重的人往往活得不够轻松，丧失了质朴的本质。有的时候质朴一些，愚钝一些并不是坏事，质朴是保持了人本来的面目。很多时候，走向社会后的人们会怀念自己的学生时代。之所以会怀念学生时代，是因为学生时代的人们往往很单纯，和人们交往时也没有那么多心机，活得比较轻松。</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是从前有一个国王，他没有王子。于是这个国王打算收养一个男孩，将来培养这个男孩成为国家的继承人。国王要认义子的事情被公布以后，有很多人家都把自己的孩子送到王宫里来。经过筛选，有三个男孩子留了下来。这三个男孩子同样都很聪明好学。于是国王把这三个男孩子叫到一起来，发给他们每个人一些种子与花盆。国王说这些种子是美丽的花种。国王要这三个男孩把这些种子种下去，谁能培养出来最美丽的花朵，谁就能成为他的义子，将来可以成为统治这个国家的国王。三个男孩子捧着花盆与种子回去了。一年之后，他们聚集在皇宫里。两个男孩子都捧着美丽的花，只有第三个男孩子空着手。国王就宣布第三个男孩子成为他的继承人。众人都疑惑不解。这时候国王为大家解释了原因，原来他一年前发给几个男孩子的种子都是事先煮熟了的。煮熟了的种子当然不会发芽开花。只有第三个男孩最诚实，没有使用聪明伎俩，王位当然要传给可靠的人。从这个故事中我们可以看到，人有的时候需要笨一点、傻一点，总是显得自己非常聪明并不是好事情。</p>
<p>风斜雨急处，要立得脚定</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>斜雨急①处，要立得脚定；花浓柳艳②处，要着得眼高；路危径险③处，要回得头早。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①风斜雨急：风雨本是自然界现象，这里用来比喻人世沧桑变化。</p>
<p>②花浓柳艳：古人常用花柳形容美女。</p>
<p>③路危径险：世路危险。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在疾风暴雨中，要能站稳脚跟；在花浓柳艳的繁华场所，能保持眼界高远；在道路危险难行的时候，能够及早回头。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>无论是风斜雨急处还是花浓柳艳处，或者是路危径险处，这些地方都好比是人将会遇到的各种艰难险阻与考验。当处在面临考验的环境中，或者是遇到艰难险阻的时候，就需要人们能够坚守自己的节操，眼光高远，保持清醒的头脑，明智地应对自己遇到的各种问题与考验。</p>
<p>清朝雍正皇帝当政的时候，大将军年羹尧深受雍正宠信。当年羹尧镇守西安的时候，他求贤若渴，招募天下有才之士，给这些人以优厚的待遇。其中有一个叫蒋衡的孝廉，来投靠年羹尧。年羹尧看到蒋衡很有才华，于是对他很是敬重厚待。年羹尧对蒋衡说：“你去投考，肯定能考中状元。”年羹尧这样说话，一方面表示了对蒋衡才华的赏识，同时也表明了年羹尧权势之大。年羹尧与雍正关系很好，又为朝廷立下过大功劳，因此难免处处得意狂妄了些。蒋衡见年羹尧骄傲自矜、狂妄不已，为此深感忧虑。他悄悄对别人说：“年羹尧过于狂傲奢侈，恐怕会惹来大祸。”于是蒋衡便找了个理由，要离开年羹尧。年羹尧再三挽留，见留不住他，也就作罢。年羹尧命人送了许多金银给蒋衡，蒋衡坚持不收。年羹尧执意要送，蒋衡没有办法，只接受了一小部分金银，其余的都还给了年羹尧。蒋衡离开年羹尧不久，年羹尧果然出事了。这一来很多人被牵扯进去，因为蒋衡及早离开，并且只接受了一小部分金银，因此没有受到牵连。由此可见，在大是大非面前，一定要有自己正确的选择，要保持清醒的头脑。</p>

<p>注释</p>
<p>①道德：人们应共同遵守的准则和规范。</p>

<p>④物外之物：现实世界以外的事物，即超越于现实物质世界的精神世界，也就是佛家所讲的不生不灭的涅般境界。</p>
<p>⑤身后之身：指人死后的个人名誉等事情。</p>
<p>⑥毋：不要。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>坚守道德节操的人，会受到一时的寂寞；曲意逢迎、依附于权势的人，却会永久凄凉。豁达明智的人能够超越现在、看到自己死后的事情，宁肯忍受一时的寂寞，也不愿意遭受永久的凄凉寂寞。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>文天祥在诗中写道“人生自古谁无死，留取丹心照汗青”，忍受一时的寂寞凄凉，好过永久的寂寞凄凉。历史上的奸臣与佞臣们，虽然获得了一时的荣耀显赫，却在青史之中留下千古骂名，为后人所唾弃。杀害抗金英雄岳飞的秦桧，在当时权倾朝野、高官厚禄、显赫荣耀。但是当他死后，后人们按照他的形象铸造出铜像来，使他永远跪在岳飞墓前谢罪。奸臣的下场果真是凄凉万古了。明朝时候的魏忠贤与严嵩，清朝时候的和珅，都在青史之中留下千古臭名。所以真正有德行的人，是不会为了一时的荣耀去换取千古骂名的。人生百年，终有一死，即使在生时为自己积累了金山与银山，高官厚禄，权势尽在自己掌握之中，当自己死后这些东西也就化为乌有，又何必为了这些东西使自己留下一个千古骂名呢，真正有智慧的人能看透什么才是最有价值的东西。古往今来，无数的仁人志士舍生取义，宁可失去生命，也不丧失自己的人格信仰，更不会为了一时的权势牺牲自己高洁的品格。在当今的社会中，同样也是如此，真正有智慧的人是不会利欲熏心，不会为了一时利益权势而丧失自己最宝贵的人格的。那些手中握有一定权力，就得意忘形，肆无忌惮为所欲为，不停为自己谋取私人利益的人，丧失了人格这个人生最宝贵的东西而不自知，难免落得身后凄凉的下场。利益与权势虽然诱人，一个人的人格却更为宝贵，为利益与权势这些握不牢的东西牺牲自己最宝贵的东西，实在是不等价的交换！</p>
<p>当藏巧于拙，须寓清于浊</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>藏巧于拙，用晦而明；寓清于浊，以屈为伸。真涉世之一壶①、藏身之三窟②也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①一壶：即一壶天，道家传说壶中别有天地，因此常以“一壶”比喻宇宙或仙境。</p>
<p>②三窟：即狡兔三窟，比喻藏身救命的地方很多。据《战国策•齐策》：“狡兔有三窟，仅得免其死耳。今君有一窟，未得高枕而卧也，请为君复凿二窟。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>把智巧隐藏在笨拙之中，平时不使人知道自己的智巧，使用时智巧才显现出来；清廉高洁的品性在污浊混杂的环境中保持，以退为进。这才是安身立命、保全自身的处世法宝。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《庄子•徐无鬼》中有这样一个故事，说的是吴王过江，来到一个山岭。这个山里住着许多猴子。猴子们看到吴王等人，都惊慌失措地四散逃走了，藏到深山老林中去。这时候有一个猴子没有逃，它在树枝上跳跃飞腾，身手很是敏捷。吴王让人用箭射它，它非常灵巧地躲过了射来的箭。吴王就下命令让人们一起射它。这下子这只猴子躲不过这么多的箭，闪避不及，中箭而死。吴王说这只猴子夸耀它的本事，以致于招来杀生之祸，我们要以此为戒啊。这只猴子夸耀自己的本事，所以为自己招惹来祸事，现实生活中也有很多这样的事例，就像这只猴子一样，人们由于夸耀自己能耐，所以为自己惹来麻烦。</p>
<p>俗话说“山外有山，人外有人”，如果以为自己非常了不起，那很可能会遭遇挫折打击。有时候做人笨一点也没什么不好，承认笨拙也不是什么耻辱的事情。宋朝时候的盛度，在任翰林院院士的时候，宋仁宗皇帝曾经叫他起草诏书。宋仁宗说：“最近旱灾非常严重，我已经向上天祈祷过了，但是不见效。我打算深深检讨自己的责任过错，征求意见，使百姓反映生活疾苦。你就在这殿上起草诏书吧，有什么问题，我可以和你马上研究。”盛度就对皇帝说：“臣长得太胖了，不能伏在地上写字，恳请陛下赐给臣一张桌子。”宋仁宗同意他的请求，马上派人去取桌子。等到桌子送来，盛度一挥而就，马上写好了诏书。宋仁宗皇帝接过来一看，非常满意，说是一个字都不需要改动，并且夸赞盛度文思敏捷。有人说：“盛度写文章一向很慢，他请求皇帝赐给他桌子，大概是想利用这段时间来构思文稿，所以当桌子取来的时候能够很快写出文章。”盛度的身体肥胖笨拙，反而为他争取了构思文章的时间，可见承认笨拙也不是坏事，如果善于利用，笨拙的缺点也能变成优点，也能发挥很好的作用。</p>

<p>经世篇</p>
<p>关于经世致用，《辞源》中解释“经世”为：治理世事；另外，对“经济”的解释为：经国济民；“致用”为：尽其所用。</p>
<p>由此可以下一个定义：经世便是关注社会现实，面对社会矛盾，并用所学解决社会问题，以求达到国治民安的实效。这一思想无不体现了中国传统知识分子讲求功利、求实、务实的思想特点以及“以天下为己任”的情怀。</p>
<p>经世致用思想的历史至少可以追溯到先秦思想家——孔子。孔子所创立的儒家思想，是中华文明的精髓，仔细分析儒家思想，可以看到，传统儒学本身就是一种“入世哲学”，孔子不遗余力地宣传他的思想，目的就是要改变春秋末年社会动乱，礼崩乐坏的局面，恢复他理想中的社会秩序。作为一种思想体系，儒家思想的一个重要特点是不尚思辨。它不像其他哲学思想那样，用极强的思辨性去解释诸如世界的本原问题，今生与来世的问题或是人世与鬼神的关系等问题，而是很实在，甚至可以说是很实用地教人们如何做人，如何行事，教统治者如何治国。</p>
<p>启人因其明，移风因其易</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>善启迪①人心者，当因其所明而渐通之，勿强开其所闭；善移风化②者，当因其所易而渐反之，毋轻矫其所难。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①启迪：启发。</p>
<p>②风化：教育感化。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>善于启发人心的人，能够借助对方心中已经明白的地方渐渐开导他，不会强迫对方接受他一时还不明白的道理；善于教育感化人的人，能够从容易的地方下手逐渐使对方改变，不会轻易就要改变其中难以变化的地方。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>善于启迪人心，要从别人明白的地方入手，使他渐渐能理解明白。如果不懂得循序渐进，想强迫别人接受自己的观点，这不是启发别人的好办法。改变一个地方的风气也是如此，从容易的地方下手，因地制宜，这样能收到很好的效果。</p>
<p>汉宣帝时，宣帝命龚遂治理渤海地区。渤海地区物产丰富，民间奢侈之风盛行。有些百姓喜欢佩戴刀剑，以此来夸富，炫耀武功与身份。龚遂来到此地后，惩罚盗贼，宣布佩戴刀剑的是盗贼，安分守己的百姓不会携带刀剑，百姓只会带着耕作的农具。有些盗贼听到这个消息后，就放下刀剑，拿起耕作的农具耕作起来。龚遂以身作则，提倡勤俭节约，他劝百姓们种桑榆。他下令说凡是男子都至少要种植一棵桑树或榆树，大白菜、葱、韭菜等也必须种植。每家还必须至少养两头猪，养五只鸡。于是百姓务农，从中得到好处后，都很感谢龚遂。遇到少年喜欢佩戴刀剑的，龚遂就劝他们卖掉刀剑，用这钱买牛。他对少年们说：“你们身上配挂刀剑，刀剑能换牛犊，那岂不是你们把牛犊挂在身上，这样多么累赘啊！”经过龚遂的教化，几年间，渤海地区风气大变，民风变得纯朴，百姓忙于种田耕作，生活逐渐变得富裕。龚遂的教化如春风化雨一般，渐渐收到良好效果。</p>
<p>雉鸡山花</p>
<p>汉光武帝时的马援，在安定边疆、教化边塞人民上取得显著成绩。他平定边塞地方后，建立制度，发展教育，兴修水利，促使人民耕作、放牧，使百姓安居乐业，社会风气变得纯朴和谐。宋朝时候的范仲淹在襄城当知州的时候，当地人不知道养蚕纺织，很少有人家种桑树的。范仲淹为此感到烦恼，他想改变此地风俗，又不能强迫老百姓种桑树，强迫百姓会引起老百姓的反感与不满。为此范仲淹思考良久，想出一个办法。他下令让犯了罪但是罪比较轻的百姓，在家中种桑树，桑树的多少决定于他所犯罪的轻重。以后还要根据他所种桑树的生长情况，来考虑是不是给他们免罪或是减罪。当百姓们从种桑树养蚕纺织中得到好处的时候，都开始种桑树养蚕纺织。改变一个地方的风气，不能用强迫的办法，从百姓能够接受的地方入手，往往能收到好的效果。</p>
<p>随时善救时，混俗能脱俗</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>随时①之内善救时，若和风之清酷暑；混俗②之中能脱俗，似淡月之映轻云。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①随时：顺应时势，顺应潮流。</p>
<p>②混俗：混同于世俗之中。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在顺应潮流的时候，善于改正时势的弊端，就像是和风能消除酷暑；混同在世俗之中又善于超脱世俗，就好比是淡月映衬轻云，清新脱俗。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>宋朝时候，南方人迷信鬼怪。当武将狄青带兵征讨侬智高的时候，大队兵马刚出桂林，狄青说：“这次征战不知道胜负如何。”说完狄青取出来一百个铜钱，握在手中说：“神明在上，如果这一次我们能得胜归来，我投掷这些铜钱落下来时能够全部正面朝上。”手下的人都劝诫他不要这样，大家说：“如果不能实现一百个铜钱都正面朝上，恐怕会严重影响兵士的士气。还是不要这样做了。”狄青不顾别人的劝阻，在大家注视中，猛然一挥手，一百个铜钱落下来，全部都是正面朝上。一时之间，全军沸腾欢呼，声音响彻原野。狄青也非常高兴，命令手下人找来一百个铁钉，把这些铜钱都钉在了原地，用青纱罩在上面，亲手封存。狄青说：“等我们凯旋回来，一定来拜谢神明取回铜钱。”后来狄青率领大军平定了邕州，返回时信守承诺，来取铜钱。这时候幕府士大夫等人一起跟随来观看，原来一百个铜钱全部都是两面钱，每一面都是正面。</p>
<p>狄青利用南方迷信鬼神的风俗，借助鬼神之事来鼓舞士气。这种做法一方面顺应了本地风俗，另一方面也证明了鬼神之事并不可信，真正可信的是人自己，在一定程度上起到了促使人们破除对鬼神的迷信作用。既然风俗与潮流不能被轻易改变，人们就需要在一定程度上顺应潮流，混同在世俗之中。与此同时，还能够消除时势潮流的弊端，能够超脱世俗。一味地顺应潮流，混同在世俗中，会使人丧失了主动性，使人变得随波逐流没有主见。如果想完全不顺应潮流，完全超脱世俗，这也是不可能实现的事情。因此最好把二者结合起来，既顺应潮流，混同世俗，同时又积极改正时势弊端，超脱世俗。</p>
<p>世事力担当，又要善摆脱</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>宇宙内事，要力担当，又要善摆脱。不担当，则无经世①之事业②；不摆脱，则无出世之襟期③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①经世：长留人世。</p>
<p>②事业：功业。</p>
<p>③襟期：胸怀，情怀。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>天下的事情，要敢于承担负责，也要善于洒脱地放下牵绊。不勇于承担，就难有历经世事考验的功业，不善于洒脱地放下牵绊，就难有遗世而独立的胸怀。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>历史上，荆轲刺秦王虽然最终失败了，但是荆轲敢作敢为的英雄事迹依旧在千百年的历史长河中熠熠闪光。但是天下的事情，除了要敢于承担负责之外，也要善于洒脱地放下牵绊。只有放下，才能遗世而独立，跳出尘世羁绊。张弛有度，刚柔并济，正是承担与放下辩证哲理的真谛。正所谓放下即是得。一个人手上拿着苹果，面对一整树的苹果时，也只有放下手中的才能得到满树的苹果。</p>
<p>有一个富翁背着许多金银财宝，到远处去寻找快乐。可是走过了千山万水，也未能寻找到快乐，于是他沮丧地坐在山道旁。一个农夫背着一大捆柴草从山上正好走下来，富翁说：“我是个令人羡慕的富翁。请问，为何没有快乐呢？”农夫放下沉甸甸的柴草，舒心地揩着汗水：“快乐也很简单，放下就是快乐呀！”富翁顿时开悟：自己背负那么重的珠宝，老怕别人抢，总怕别人暗害，整日忧心忡忡，快乐从何而来？于是富翁将珠宝、钱财接济穷人，专做善事，慈悲为怀，这样滋润了他的心灵，他也尝到了快乐的味道。</p>
<p>当下，人人都在为缠身的责任和使命劳神殒命，试想快乐从何而来？佛家说：“菩提本无树，明镜亦非台，本来无一物，何处染尘埃。”</p>
<p>惟有放下，方得一片舒心的清净地。</p>
<p>思林下风味，权势念自轻</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>仕途①虽赫奕②，常思林下③的风味，则权势之念自轻；仕途虽纷华④，常思泉下⑤的光景⑥，则利欲之心自淡。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①仕途：当官的路途。</p>
<p>②赫奕：声名显赫。</p>
<p>③林下：以幽静的林下喻指隐居之所。</p>
<p>④纷华：繁华。</p>
<p>⑤泉下：九泉之下，指死亡。</p>
<p>⑥光景：时光。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当官的路途虽异常显赫，若能常回想退隐林下的趣味，那么权宜苟且的念头就自然而然地减轻了；当官的路途虽异常繁华，若能常常想到死后不过一抷黄土生不带来死不带去，那么贪图荣华富贵的欲望自然而然也就淡了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>戎马一生的新中国开国将军许世友的名字原为许仕友，“仕”与“世”，一字之别，意义大相径庭。一个世俗为己，一个心系天下。古往今来，面对仕途与世途，下仕欲上仕，小财盼大财，为甚众之趋。于是为官则谋权，权大威风，权可谋财；为民则取财，财大气粗，财可谋官。于是乎，官道财道兼得者大有人在。</p>
<p>范仲淹《岳阳楼记》有云：“居庙堂之高，则忧其民；处江湖之远，则忧其君。”今下之人，居庙堂者有几人忧民？处江湖者几人忧君？仕途坎坷，古有柳宗元被贬还念一方之民；世途险恶，梁山泊落草英雄仍不忘报国之心。今非昔比，人心不古！荣华富贵成为仕途与世途的必取之物。</p>
<p>一位外国哲人说：“死亡的氛围是沉默的，是无言的期待；向一团黑暗沉陷，一切知觉统统化为乌有；我们完全脱离生命的束缚，完全丧失自我支配的能力，断绝了同他人的交往——这一切都是令人担忧的原因。总而言之，死亡乃是向一切熟悉事物的告别，同时给后死的亲属带去一个咄咄逼人的信息。垂死者或后死者，都要经受离别的考验，死亡的黑暗就成了因生命消失而造成压抑心理的原因。”古今中外，貌似只有用死亡才能警醒那些茫茫追求功利的仕途者。</p>
<p>清贫与富贵，闲云野鹤与在堂为官，纵使生活的辛酸与享受不同，人生不过百年，谁又能逃过死亡的光顾呢？</p>
<p>因势利导之，救时应变法</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>解斗者，助之以威则怒气自平；惩贪者，济之以欲则利心反淡。所谓因其势而利导之，亦救时应变一权宜法①也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①权宜法：顺应形式变化而采取的暂时适用的办法。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>劝解争斗的人们，给争斗的人助威加油，他们的怒气自然会平息；惩戒贪婪的人，送他们想要的东西给他们，这样一来他们的利欲之心反而会减淡。这就是所谓的顺应事物本身发展趋势，引导其向正确的方向发展。这也是一个救治时势弊端灵活变通的方法。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>西门豹做地方长官的时候，听说此地每年都为河伯娶妻子。他从百姓那里了解到，此地三老、廷掾每年都向老百姓征收一笔钱，用其中一部分钱给河伯娶妻子，其余的钱他们和巫婆们平分。到给河伯娶妻子的那一天，巫婆看到哪家有漂亮的女孩，就说要这个女孩做河伯的妻子，让女孩洗澡更衣，坐到席子上，连人带席子沉到河中。如果不给河伯娶妻子，河伯就会发怒，那样百姓就遭殃了。河伯发大水，大伙都得被淹死。所以城中许多人家都带着女儿逃走了。西门豹说：“下次河伯再娶妻子的时候，希望你们能来告诉我，我也想看看如何给河伯娶亲。”到了河伯娶亲的那天，西门豹来到河边。他说：“把河伯的新娘请出来。”他看过新娘之后，说：“这个女子不够漂亮，麻烦大巫婆向河伯通报一声，我们会为他找一个更漂亮的女子。”说完就让人把大巫婆抱起来扔到河里去。过了一会儿不见大巫婆回来。西门豹就让人把巫婆的弟子们又扔到河里去。</p>
<p>过了一会，西门豹说：“去的都是女人，不能说清楚事情，麻烦三老走一趟吧。”于是又让人把三老都扔到水里去。西门豹恭恭敬敬地对着河水站立了好长时间，转过头来说：“他们怎么去了就不回来，谁再去催一催？”说着就想让廷掾下去催。他们都面如土色，不停叩头。又过了一会，西门豹说：“你们都起来吧，河伯大概是不娶妻子了。”从此以后，没有人再敢说要给河伯娶妻子了。西门豹的做法可以说是因势利导之，他听说了地方的陋习以后，没有强行命令改正陋习，而是假借观看为河伯娶妇，假装对河伯恭敬，顺应了地方习俗，在此基础上使大家明白了河伯之说不可信，从而消除了地方陋习。</p>
<p>救败慎策鞭，图成不停棹</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>救既败之事者，如驭临崖之马，休轻策一鞭；图垂成之功者，如挽①上滩之舟②，莫少停一棹③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①挽：拉，牵引。</p>
<p>②上滩之舟：上了浅滩的船。</p>
<p>③棹（zhào）：划。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>挽回那些已成败局的事情，如同驾驭临近悬崖边上的烈马，不能轻易地给马再加一鞭，否则会促使它更快地坠落悬崖，不可挽救。谋求快要成就的功业，如同要将上了浅滩的船倒回深水之中，必须一鼓作气，一桨都不能停划，否则将功败垂成。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>放弃其实就是一种选择。走在人生的十字路口，只有学会放弃不适合自己的道路。面对失败，你必须学会放弃懦弱；面对成功，你必须学会放弃骄傲；面对老弱病残，你必须学会放弃冷漠，实施救助……我们只有在困境中放弃沉重的负担，才会拥有必胜的信念。放弃我们必须放弃的、应该放弃的，甚至比拥有更重要。</p>
<p>因此，我们应该学会放弃，明白这点，也许就会在失败、迷茫、愁闷，面临“心苦”时，找到平衡点，找回自己的人生坐标。</p>
<p>可惜，并不是所有的探索都能发现鲜为人知的奥秘，并不是所有的跋涉都能抵达胜利的彼岸，并不是每一滴汗水都会有收获，并不是每一个故事都会有完美结局。</p>
<p>唐末农民起义军领袖黄巢出身盐商家庭，与王仙芝同贩私盐，曾数次应试而每每名落孙山。他善骑射，好诗赋，生平最喜结交豪侠之士。造反后黄巢自称“冲天太保平均大将军”，与王决裂后一度由强到弱，又由弱到强，被贬为“流寇”的黄巢进行了一场历时1000多日，从湖北渡江南下而后由广州北上，横扫十余省，行程数万里的前所未有的远征，这是一次退却形式下的伟大进攻。然而，历史注定了这是一次功败垂成的远征。当旋风般的铁骑在中国的大地上划上一个大弧后，六十万大军攻破了唐朝都城长安，而后又雪崩似的退出。</p>
<p>人生如棋，当局者迷，世事如棋，旁观者清。我们生活在这个世界上，其实就是人生的博弈。进取者，可以在对抗中找到自己的成就感；淡泊者，可以从容地享受悠闲的感觉。成功了，有棋开得胜的得意，失意了，胜负乃兵家常事。有从容布局，志得意满；也有一招不慎，满盘皆输。有功败垂成，也有绝地逢生。世事万象，莫出棋外！</p>

<p>如沤生大海，如影灭长空</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>物莫大于天地日月，而子美①云：“日月笼中鸟，乾坤水上萍。”事莫大于揖逊②正诛③，而康节④云：“唐虞揖逊三杯酒，汤武征诛一局棋⑤。”人能以此胸襟眼界吞吐六合⑥，上下千古，事来如沤⑦生大海，事去如影灭长空，自经纶万变而不动一尘矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①子美：唐代诗人杜甫（721—770年）的字。</p>
<p>②揖逊：让位给贤者。</p>
<p>③征诛：以武力征讨夺取政权。</p>
<p>④康节：邵雍，宋代共城人，易学家。字尧夫，谥康节。</p>
<p>⑤三杯酒、一局棋：皆喻事情寻常容易。</p>
<p>⑥六合：上下四方，指天地间。</p>
<p>⑦沤：水泡。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>天下之物没有比天地日月还要大的，可是唐代诗人杜甫却说：“日月像笼中的小鸟，天地也仅是水面上的泡沫而已。”天下之事没有比拱手把政权让给贤者或以武力夺取政权还要大的，但是北宋哲学家邵雍却说：“唐尧让位给虞舜只是像喝三杯酒那样微不足道，周武王征伐商纣仅是像下一局棋那样寻常容易。”人们如果能以这样的胸怀和眼界来纵观天下万物，评论古今之事，事情到来就像水泡生成于大海，事情过去就如影子消失在天空。这样，自然能做到处理各种各样的纷繁变故而内心从容镇定。”</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在古人看来：天地万物以天地日月为大。而诗圣杜甫（字子美）却有诗言：“日月笼中鸟，乾坤水上沤。”北宋哲学家邵雍（溢号康节）却称：“唐虞捐逊三杯酒，汤武征伐一局棋。”</p>
<p>当悠悠千古事齐涌上这两位诗人的心头时，漫长的历史长河被浓缩了，宇宙人生的轻重主次也被明确化了，诗人思绪也就可以超越有限而进入无限，诗人的眼界更不会局限在小是小非上。</p>
<p>读诗使人灵秀，读史使人明智。难怪《菜根谭》的原著者洪应明在品味杜甫和邵雍的这两段诗时，无限感慨上心头：人能有此等大胸襟、高眼界，就可胸怀天地四方，就可看破亿万年的沧桑变迁，视事来如泡沫生于大海，不必大惊小怪；视事去如鸟影隐匿长空，干干净净，不留痕迹。即使是面对千丝万缕的国家大事，也能从容处置，不无端地扰动一尘一末。</p>
<p>《菜根谭》的主旨深蕴着宇宙意识，直契天地境界。有如此意识与境界，犹如在空中观物，再据此以冷眼看人世间的是是非非、争争斗斗，在千年的历史长河中，皇室权贵们为城头变幻的大王旗、英雄豪杰们为名誉地位而虎战不休，也不过是如苍蝇因羶气而聚集、如蚂蚁因抢食而竞斗；世间的各种是非如蜜蜂飞起，各种得失如刺猬的硬刺那样竖立，以冷情处之，就可以如洪灶融化真金、如热水消融冰雪。</p>
<p>不贪钩下饵，能解笼中囮</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>糟糠不为彘①肥，何事②偏贪钩下饵？锦绮③岂因牺④贵，谁人能解笼中囮⑤？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①彘（zhì）：猪。</p>
<p>②何事：为什么。</p>
<p>③锦绮：有彩色花纹的丝织品。</p>
<p>④牺：用于祭祀的的牲畜。</p>
<p>⑤囮（é）：鸟媒，经过驯服后的用于引诱野鸟以便捕捉的鸟。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>糟糠连猪都喂不肥，根本不好吃又没有营养价值，用来做诱饵却偏偏总能够引鱼吞钩；那种漂亮的丝织品其实并不是因为用了纯色的鸟羽才显得珍贵，人们却总是喜欢以拥有这样的东西而夸耀，又有谁顾及捕鸟人的笼子里用来招引其他鸟儿的那只鸟的感受呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>如果那只鸟媒真有感触，首先会痛惜竟有如此之多的鸟类受害者，前赴后继，一群群地上当受骗，为了那一点点根本不是食物的口腹之利丢了性命；其次会是责怪和困惑：为什么不能多加观察明辨自己的真实处境，为什么不能以前车之鉴来禁绝自己的贪欲，就这么白白地上钩入笼呢？</p>
<p>生活也是如此，对万事皆不能过于“贪”。贪财、贪权、贪色都会把人引向迷失，甚至是罪恶与灭亡。想想美女蛇的故事，还有古今贪官污吏的下场，其危害自不必细言。台湾中台禅寺圣严法师的一句自在语，曰：“经常少欲知足的人，才是无虞匮乏的富人。”那么应该如何戒贪呢？圣严法师从佛学的角度给出答案：“戒贪的最好方法就是多布施、多奉献、多与人分享。”</p>
<p>不过，我们也不能完全无欲无求，完全无欲无求会导致生活无目标无理想。试想我们整天除了吃并无其他活动，像蠕虫一样地生活，必然是无动力也无意义的。不如找到一个合适的欲求尺度，更好地生活吧。</p>

<p>宋朝的时候，循王张俊有一天在后花园中赏花游园，看到一个老兵躺在地上睡觉，循王就踢了踢他说：“你怎么困成这样？”老兵起来回答说：“没有什么事情可做，只好睡觉。”循王说：“你会做什么事情？”老兵回答说：“各种事情都知道一点，比如与别国来往互赠礼物等事情也略知一二。”循王说：“你能做这样的事情，那么我给你一万缗钱，你去海外走一遭如何？”老兵回答说：“钱不够。”循王说：“五万缗钱怎么样？”老兵回答说：“还是不够。”循王说：“那你需要多少钱？”老兵回答说：“没有一百万，也得五十万才行。”循王就给了这个老兵五十万缗钱，任老兵自由支配。这个老兵拿到钱后就建造了一艘大船，华丽异常，汇集能歌善舞的美女和乐师一百多人，四处搜罗绫罗绸缎、珍奇古玩、奇珍异果以及黄金白银等，招募了数十个身穿紫衣、气质不俗、有文武官员派头的人，率领百余名士兵，天天喝着美酒，欣赏着美妙的音乐，过得非常快乐。这样过了大概有一个月的时间，突然有一天开船渡海而去。</p>
<p>一年之后，老兵带着珍珠、犀牛角、各种香料、药材等物，此外还有许多骏马，满载而归，获利几十倍。当时恰好赶上各将军都缺少好马，只有循王得到骏马，军容大壮，因此格外欢喜。循王问老兵：“你是怎么做成这件事情的？”老兵回答说：“我到海外各国，自称是大宋的使者，前去拜见各位戎王，同时送给他们绫罗锦缎、珍奇古玩，结交当地权贵，用美酒佳肴招待他们，使美女歌舞弹唱来为他们助兴。他们君臣之间都很高兴，于是用骏马换美女，而且为我准备船只载运马匹。他们用珍珠、犀牛角、各种香料、药材等物来换绫罗锦缎，还送给我许多珍贵的礼物。所以才获得如此丰厚的利润。”循王感叹不已，重赏了这位老兵，问他愿不愿意再去一次。老兵回答说：“这不过是戏耍罢了。如果再去就被识破了。您还是让我像从前那样去后园中养老吧。”这个老兵懂得得意不宜再往，及早回头才可靠，是真正有智慧豁达的人。</p>
<p>少壮当用意，衰老宜忘情</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>少壮者当事事用意而意反轻，徒泛泛作水中凫①而已，何以振云霄之翮②？衰老者宜事事忘情而情反重，徒碌碌为辕下驹③而已，何以脱缰锁之身？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①凫：水鸟，俗称野鸭子。</p>
<p>②翮；羽茎，鸟的翅膀。</p>
<p>③辕下驹：车辕下的小马驹，小马不善于驾车，形容人局促不大方的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>正当年富力强的时候，应当认真对待每一件事情，却反而事事漫不经心，就像浮在水面上的野鸭子一样，这样怎么能展翅高飞呢？衰老的人应对每件事情都放得下感情，却反而事事更加执着，就像那车辕下的小马驹一样，这样怎么能摆脱自己身上的束缚呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>年轻力壮的时候，是发奋图强、展翅高飞的时候。等到人进入老年，日渐衰弱老迈，这个时候对每件事情也就看得淡了，没有必要自己和自己过不去，每件事情都执着不忘。李广是西汉时一位有名大将，他威猛机智，曾立下显赫战功，却一直没有得到大的封赏。到了卫青与霍去病与匈奴大战的时候，李广已经是一位老人。他已经六十多岁，却追随大将军卫青征战匈奴。李广因为迷路获罪，卫青派人请李广过去问话。李广说：“我从年轻的时候就与匈奴交战，大大小小的仗打了七十多次。这次有幸能和大将军出来与匈奴的单于开战，大将军又让我带路，而且我还迷了路，这难道不是天意吗！而且我已经六十多岁了，绝不能再在刀笔吏面前受辱了。”说完，李广拔刀自杀。李广死后，很多人为他痛哭流泪。李广以六十多岁的年纪，依然出征匈奴，令人佩服的同时也为之惋惜。虽说老当益壮，但是当精力衰减时，有些事可以放下，不必要事事在意。</p>
<p>俗话说“自古英雄出少年”，在年富力强的时候，正是努力拼搏有所作为的好时候。如果不抓住时间，努力拼搏，让时间白白溜走，那就太可惜了。正如英雄岳飞词中所云：“莫等闲，白了少年头，空悲切。”霍去病在二十几岁的时候已经成为战功显著的大将军，他留下千古名言“匈奴未灭，何以家为”激励了无数人。在漠北之战中，全面歼灭敌人主力，封狼居胥，真正是少年英雄。诸葛亮出山辅佐刘备的时候，年岁也不大，还不到三十岁。清朝皇帝康熙在十几岁的时候，就想出办法消灭了辅政大臣鳌拜。光阴似水，不经意间已经悄悄逝去，如果不抓紧机会，到白发苍苍时再后悔，就一切都来不及了。在年轻力壮、精力充沛的时候，多吃苦努力，这样才能避免白头时后悔。</p>
<p>饮酒莫酩酊，看花勿离披</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>帆只扬五分，船便安；水只注五分，器便稳。如韩信①以勇略震主被擒，陆机②以才名冠世见杀，霍光③败于权势逼君，石崇④死于财赋敌国，皆以十分取败者也。康节⑤云：“饮酒莫教成酩酊，看花慎勿至离披⑥。”旨哉言乎⑦！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①韩信：秦末淮阴人，与萧何、张良并称“汉兴三杰”。初从项羽，后归刘邦，封楚王。后被刘邦以谋反罪降为淮阴侯，最终被吕后所杀。</p>
<p>②陆机：字士衡，西晋吴郡人，以文才名噪一时。后事成都王司马颖，曾官平原内史、后将军、河北大都督，后因战败受谮，为司马颖所杀。</p>
<p>③霍光：字子孟，汉河东平阳人。武帝时为奉车都尉，在朝小心谨慎，出入宫廷二十余年，未尝有过。武帝死后，霍光秉政二十余年，族党满朝，权倾内外。宣帝亲政后，收霍氏兵权，并以谋反罪夷其族。</p>
<p>④石崇：晋南皮人，生于青州，故小字青奴，又字季伦。历任散骑常侍、荆州刺史等职，尝劫远使商客致富，于河阳置金谷园，奢靡无度，家财敢与国库比。后为人所谮，被赵王司马伦杀害。敌：相匹敌，抗衡。</p>
<p>⑤康节：邵雍，字尧夫。康节是朝廷赐给他的谥号。宋代的著名学者，中国占卜界的主要代表人物、象数派易学的代表人物。</p>
<p>⑥离披：散乱的样子。</p>
<p>⑦旨哉言乎：意味深远之言。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>风帆只要扬起二分之一，船就能稳稳地航行。水只要注入二分之一，容器就能稳定。这就如：韩信因为勇猛和谋略并济，招来刘邦的猜忌而被杀害；陆机因为才华横溢，名噪一时，受人谗毁被杀；霍光因为权势之大使君主觉得受到了威胁而在死后被诛灭九族，石崇因为富可敌国而死于赵王伦之手。他们都是因为达到了极限才导致败亡的。邵雍说：“喝酒不能喝得酩酊大醉，看花不要看得神情散乱。”这真是金玉良言啊！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>哲学家把人的生存分成高限和低限两个等级：低限生存，即使是最为司空见惯的“赖活着”，也决不等同于自然的物理运动，更不等同于一般动物的“活着”。高限生存则更艰难，要求具有对生存可能性的足够预期，而且还要求具备取舍基本生存资源甚至生命本身的勇气，是高风险的运作。往往是一着不慎，便连同低限生存的希望也彻底破灭。“高度决定视野，角度改变观念，尺度决定人生”。因此，“留有余地”便成为中国古代生存智慧之一，即：中等强度的期望值更容易成功！</p>
<p>所谓的“水过满则溢，人过执无乐”也是这个道理。让自己既在任何事物之中，又在任何事物之外，能进能退，有舍有得。</p>

<p>以势利害人，以势利自毙</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>附势者如寄生依木，木伐而寄生亦枯；窃利者如营虰①盗人，人死而营虰亦灭。始以势利害人，终以势利自毙。势利之为害也，如是夫！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①营虰（chéng）：人肠内的寄生虫。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>依附权势的人就像寄生依附树木而长，树木砍伐后寄生也必然枯萎；贪求财利的人就像营虰吸食人的营养，人死后营虰也必然灭亡。开始时以权势与财利损害他人，最终以权势与财利自取灭亡。权势与财利对人的危害，就是这样的啊！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>趋炎附势者的出发点，大多是为了取得某些名利权势之类的利益，或是为了扩展既得利益。因此，他们便有一种典型的“有奶便是娘，给钱便称爹”的心理，当他们不仅将趋炎附势当作一项权宜之计，而且还将此当作一种无本万利的投机机巧，他们的策略就是见风使舵，见便宜就沾，树倒则猢狲散，毫无原则可言，毫无是非廉耻的观念，毫无忠诚的信念。</p>
<p>正因为趋炎附势者活在世，就是不择手段而又千方百计地作人生的投机与钻营，所以，这种人所有的只是卑贱的人格，没有为人的自尊、自强与自信，人品卑劣低下，所过的只是依权依势的寄生生活。</p>
<p>清兵入关后，清朝的官员由两部分人员组成，一是明朝降臣，二是满族大臣，前者蓄发盘髻，后者则是剃发梳辫。每次入朝时，官员们各分两班站立，彼此相安无事，但不久，这一格局即被拍马者打破。</p>
<p>某日，明朝降臣孙之獬一改常貌，剃发梳辫上朝，本想跻身于满族大臣之列，以此来邀宠献媚，却因他是汉人而未被满族大臣们接纳；汉族大臣们又以他形貌装束一如满人，认为他不应位列汉族大臣之中。孙之獬左右不讨好，恼羞成怒之余，就给顺治皇帝上了奏章，认为清朝允许明朝遗民保留原有的装束，只会损害清朝清帝的威仪。顺治皇帝见奏，大为赞赏，遂发布了“留头不留发，留发不留头”的严厉的剃发令。</p>
<p>天下欲反清复明的志士见此闻此，无人不对孙之獬恨之入骨，不久，山东的一支义兵攻入淄川，杀了孙之獬全家，闻者无不拍手称快。</p>
<p>所以，就根本，就长远的眼光看，趋炎附势者是失多于得，失也是大于得的。</p>
<p>某些时候，趋炎附势者看似是春风得意、一帆风顺。事实上，他们的力量十分渺小，对事对人毫无真诚可言，当然也就不可能与别人建立起正常、健康的人际关系。而他们与权势者所建立起的人身依附关系，因人事社会的变迁，也不可能无限地、长期地维持下去。荣宠与羞辱共蒂同根，又何必张扬？厌辱虽是常理，又何须一味自降人格地去卖身求荣？</p>
<p>知处阴敛翼，巉岩亦坦途</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鸽恶铃而高飞，不知敛翼而铃自息；人恶①影而疾走，不知处阴而影自灭。故愚夫徒疾走高飞，而平地反为苦海；达士知处阴敛翼，而巉②岩亦是坦途。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①恶：厌恶。</p>
<p>②巉（chán）岩：险峻的山崖。巉，高峻险要的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>鸽子因为讨厌自己身上的铃声而高飞，不知道只要收起翅膀不动那铃声自然就会消失；人讨厌自己的影子而快走，却不知道只要到了阴暗的地方影子就会消失了。所以愚蠢的人只是一味徒劳地盲目行动，那原本平坦的道路反而成了无边的苦海；通达的人知道身居阴处影自灭、收敛翅膀铃自息，那么险峻的山崖也能变成平坦大道。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有的时候，旁观者会觉得非常可笑：鸽子厌恶铃声而展翅高飞，不知道收起翅膀铃声自然会止息；人们厌恶自己的影子而快速奔走，不知道置身阴暗处影子自然会消失。如同蠢笨的鸽子一样，世上太多的人徒然奔走好高骛远，把平地变成了苦海；可还是有明智之人知道置身暗处收拢翅膀，即使是高险的山峰也会变成平坦的大路。这里说的其实还是一个收敛羽翼、韬光养晦的老话题，比喻却别有意味。</p>
<p>战国时期，在将近200年割据争雄的残酷争斗中，秦国产生了一代又一代杰出的领导人，秦献公、秦孝公、惠文王、昭襄王，秦国从疲弱一步步走向强大。公元前306年至公元前251年在位的秦国国君昭襄王，为中国历史上在位时间最长的国君之一，最著名的、决定秦赵两国命运的“长平之战”，就是在秦昭王在位时期发生的。这位昭襄王，在位56年，堪与康熙、乾隆比肩。为君一任，他的遭遇可以分为两个阶段：前一阶段，韬光养晦，由家族成员以最佳组合最优成本实现扩张；后一阶段，顺时势而动，为秦国的辉煌夯实了根基。</p>
<p>昭襄王在位初期，由其母宣太后当权，舅舅魏冉为相，史称“王少，宣太后自治事，任魏冉为政，威震秦国”。不过秦昭襄王并非傀儡或孬种。他和魏冉，心中各有分寸，可谓默契相处。昭襄王默默地也从母亲和舅舅那里学到了很多有用的知识和经验。当然，宣太后作为一位母亲，在骨子里是爱护儿子的，她和魏冉也乐于把权力渐渐交还给昭襄王。可以设想，如果一场宫廷夺位之争后，演变成外戚跋扈、君王记恨、帝后各树党羽，为了权力互用心机甚至火拼，秦国的强盛就必成泡影。昭襄王前期，正是秦国走向强盛的又一关键时刻，这是他的收敛锋芒、韬光养晦，不计臣代君职，与母亲、魏冉同心协力、相互包容起到的巨大作用，这也是楚国、赵国、齐国，所谓一时的大国都稀缺的战略心胸。</p>
<p>韬晦不等于无为，反而是智慧的反映。但在现实生活中，却存在着这样一种自恃颇高的人，他们锐气旺盛，锋芒毕露，处事则不留余地，待人则咄咄逼人，有十分的才能与聪慧，就十二分地表现出来。他们往往有着充沛的精力，很高的热情，也有一定的才能，但这种人却往往在人生旅途上屡遭波折。</p>
<p>事实上，在错综复杂的社会中，刻意炫耀才能，不仅会招来别人的妒忌，还会被认为是轻浮。一个有着远大抱负的人，当时机不成熟时，往往会采取韬光养晦的谋略。韬晦是为人处世的一种策略，也是做人处事的一门学问。</p>
<p>矜消盖世功，改补弥天过</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>盖世的功劳，当不得一个“矜”字；弥天①的罪过，当不得一个“改”字。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①弥天：满天，形容极其大。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>盖世的功劳，由一个“矜”字所抵消；极大的罪过，由一个“改”字得以弥补。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>功劳再大，如果居功自傲，功劳也就被抵消了。汉高祖刘邦手下的大功臣韩信，为刘邦夺取江山立下了汗马功劳。只是在功成名就之际，不知道收敛自己的锋芒，种种原因加在一起最终使刘邦将他除掉。后来东汉光武帝刘秀，手下有两名大将，建立显赫战功之后，自己主动放下兵权，毫不居功自傲。一个是邓禹，另一个叫耿弇。邓禹和耿弇都是年轻将领。邓禹有显赫战功，但是在与赤眉作战时没有大战功，于是他主动解除兵权，归还印绶，不贪恋权力，安守本分。耿弇战功卓越，光武帝赞扬他功劳超过汉高祖时候的开国功臣韩信，等到天下安定后不久，耿弇就主动解除兵权，寿终正寝。邓禹与耿弇不居功自傲，知道谦让守本分，所以寿终正寝。可见自矜自傲能把自己的大功劳都抵消，还会为自己带来灾祸。</p>
<p>犯下了大过错，如果能知道悔改，也就能弥补自己的过错了。三国时候的张飞是一员猛将，他跟随着刘备打江山，立下汗马功劳。张飞勇猛善战，并且也能做到粗中有细，有时候也能出一些好主意。这位猛将最后死于自己的部下之手，令人感叹。张飞脾气暴躁，部下士卒有过错，他严厉惩罚。他喝醉后，惩罚起手下来更加严酷。酒醒的时候，他也曾为此后悔，但是却一直没有改掉这个毛病。有一次，他喝醉了酒，部下有了过错，被他狠狠打了一顿鞭子。部下不能忍受，趁着他喝醉了酒，把他杀死后逃跑了。张飞为自己暴躁严酷的毛病送了性命，他并非不知道自己的缺点，只是不能够改正缺点，最终害了自己。明朝时候徐存斋被翰林院派到浙中当督学的时候，还不到三十岁。有一个秀才在文章中用了“颜苦孔之卓”句，徐存斋把这句圈住，点批了“杜撰”二个字，判为四等。这个秀才就来向徐存斋讨教说：“您的见解当然是正确的，然而‘苦孔之卓’这句话出在扬子《法言》一文中，不是学生我杜撰的。”徐存斋站起来说：“我侥幸当官，没有很好地做学问，如今承蒙你赐教。”于是徐存斋把这个秀才的文章改判为一等。此事传开后，人们都称赞徐存斋有气量。徐存斋知错就改，并不因为自己的身份地位就不承认错误，这种勇于认错的精神值得人们钦佩。</p>
<p>居轩冕之中，有山林之气</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>居轩冕①之中，不可无山林的气味；处林泉之下，须要怀廓庙的经纶②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①轩冕：古时大夫以上官员的车乘和冕服。古时大夫以上的官吏，每当出门时都要穿礼服坐马车，马车就是轩，礼服就是冕，此喻高官。</p>
<p>②经论：比喻策眩。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>身居显要官位的人，不可以不保持一种隐居山林淡泊名利的情趣；隐居在田园山林之中，也应该有胸怀天下治理国家的壮志和理想。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古代文人受儒、道思想影响，一方面积极入世，实现理想抱负；另一方面寄心出世，品味林泉真趣，两相矛盾的东西统一为一个整体。这样，在权势上可以保持几分山林雅趣，缓和过分热衷名利的紧张。这里的出世又分为真出世和假出世，假出世是以出世作为入世的手段，作为当官的资本；真出世是退隐，不屑于争权夺利、尔虞我诈。一个人只要能做到隐于山林间隐士们的高风亮节，就能体会出孔子所说的“富贵于我如浮云”，这时才能领悟到生活在林泉之下的哲理。不过，不管是真退隐还是假出世都存在“不在其位而谋其政”，都关心国家大事这样的问题。尽管你可以过闲云野鹤般自由自在的生活，但不可以完全忘记国家兴亡大事。在现代，人们参政议政的意识更强烈，表现人们意愿的方式也更多，即社会的透明度越来越大，所以个人的生活方式可以自己选择。但是“志在林泉，胸怀廊庙”的传统依然影响着人们，社会的发展不容许人把自己封闭于社会之外，锁在个人的小天地里。</p>
<p>诸葛亮是历史上一代名相，被人们称为“卧龙先生”。诸葛亮的少年时代，是在战乱流离中度过的，直到他进入成年时，才在襄阳城西的隆中置了一片田产，建了几间房子，和姐弟三人一起定居下来，自始过着“躬耕垄亩”的生活。但是，他身居隆中，却胸怀治理国家的雄心壮志。刘备在新野时，徐庶向他推荐诸葛亮，说他是人中之龙，劝刘备亲自屈驾迎请。刘备三顾茅庐之后得与诸葛亮相见，相见后就在诸葛亮茅屋请教起天下大计来。刘备说：“汉室倾危，奸臣专权，皇帝蒙尘，我自不量力，欲申大义于天下，却囚智术短浅，狼狈至今，虽然如此，我大志尚存。请问有何大计能使我完成宿愿呢？”于是诸葛亮对天下的形势进行了分析，为刘备指出了成就霸业的长远大计。思路清楚，明确中肯，足见其超人的政治、军事头脑。后来，刘备对关羽、张飞说：“我之得孔明，犹鱼得水。”诸葛亮也依靠刘备施展了自己抱负，成为辅佐蜀国的千古名相。</p>
<p>无过便是功，无怨便是德</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>处世不必邀①功，无过便是功；与人②不要感德③，无怨便是德。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①邀：求取。</p>
<p>②与人：施恩于人。</p>
<p>③感德：感激他人恩德。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>为人处世不必想方设法去争取功劳，其实只要没有过失就算是有功劳；帮助他人不必希望对方感恩戴德，只要对方不怨恨就算有恩德了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>所谓“无过便是功，无怨便是德”，并非指俗话所说“多做多错，少做少错，不做不错”的消极思想，而是一种舍己为人的宽恕精神。其实真正的施舍，绝不是对人施小惠，完全是一种自我牺牲。反之假如施恩而图报，那就等于贪婪而不是施舍，“真正的施舍就跟蜡烛一般，牺牲自己照亮别人”。佛教所说的六度，第一度就是布施、法施、无畏施。当行菩萨道时，右手施人左手并不图报，这恰如佛经所说的“但愿众生得离苦，不为自己求安乐”，这真是一句不朽的至理名言。“施比受更快乐”，这是宗教家的说法，假如用功利观点来衡量，就是“欲取先予”。</p>
<p>做人凭良心，做事凭原则，做人就要做善良的人，做事就要做成功的事，这是做人与做事的基本原则。但是愿望离结果总是有一段距离，只要是为实现愿望付出了努力，自己就会觉得问心无愧。自我牺牲是应该的，而不应求取功名；帮助别人是应该的，而不应索取回报，只有这样真正的功名才会自然得到。</p>
<p>雪溪放艇图</p>
<p>事穷原初心，功成观末路</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>事穷势蹙①之人，当原其初心；功成行满②之士，要观其末路③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①势蹙：势态紧迫。意指穷途末路。</p>
<p>②功成行满：事业有所成就，一切都如意圆满。</p>
<p>③末路：路的终点。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>对于一个事业遭受失败、事事不顺心的人，应该体谅他原本奋发上进的初衷而不是责备他；对于一个事业成功而感到功成名就的人，要观察他是否能持之以恒，有个好的结局。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>对待功成名就者，从来都报以鲜花、掌声，毫不吝赞誉言辞。而对事业落败者，却多报以冷落、淡忘，更别提去理解、慰藉、宽容了。人们劝慰说虽败犹荣，更像是一句温柔的伤心恶语，更像是一种裹上怜悯糖衣的轻鄙。其实，成败何足论，英雄自有真。失败者的历练，何尝不是后来成功者的深刻启迪，何尝不是再给自己一次漂亮转身的绝佳机遇？</p>
<p>在社会上筹谋大事业时，没有人开始就预期失败，但实际上看起来，成功的人很少，失败的人反而太多。失败的人，遂穷势蹙，虽有手足，虽有才华，亦徒增悲观，徒叹奈何了。这时候，最妥当的办法就是一心清静，想想原来谋事的居心是否善良正直，是否合乎天理人意，有无缺点落后之处？如最初的出发点错了，其事失败是一定的。俗话说：“好的开始是成功的一半。”如有当初出发的正心，必定成就光辉灿烂的事业。一失败就陷于悲观、自暴自弃的人是没有前途，没有希望的。</p>
<p>而“人无千日好，花无百日红”，在成功之后，很少有人会想到在日后会否遭受失败，那顾首不顾尾、思一而忘十的人，其后果是不堪想像的。人生在世，最要紧的是在功成时急流勇退。在得意的时候，当思末路的来临，最好是退让给更贤明的人继其事业，自己则善治其身，静心修养。</p>
<p>富贵宜宽厚，聪明宜敛藏</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>富贵家宜宽厚而反忌克①，是富贵而贫贱其行，如何能享？聪明人宜敛藏②而反炫耀，是聪明而愚懵③其病，如何不败？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①忌刻：刻薄不厚道。忌，猜疑、嫉妒。刻，刻薄。</p>
<p>②敛藏：隐藏起来。敛，收，敛束。</p>
<p>③懵：心神迷乱，无知。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个富贵的人家应当待人宽厚却反而刻薄待人，这是身居富贵却以贫贱的行动为人处世，如何能享有长久富贵？聪明的人本来应当收敛自己的才华却反而时时炫耀自己，这是聪明人却带有糊涂无知的毛病，怎么能不失败呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>隋朝大功臣高，被封为齐国公，显赫一时。高最得意的时候，他的母亲曾经告诫他说：“你富贵已极，只差砍头了，千万要小心啊！”一个身处富贵之中的人，需要宽厚待人，敛藏自己的锋芒，不然很可能会因为自己的富贵而招来祸患。如果处在富贵之中，不知道收敛锋芒，恐怕不能使富贵保持长久。一个聪明人懂得敛藏自己的才华，如果时时把自己的聪明拿出来炫耀，这种聪明终究流入浅薄，很可能会为自己招来别人的忌恨。</p>
<p>秦国将要攻打楚国，秦王命大将王翦带领六十万兵马出战，秦始皇亲自把王翦送到灞桥上。临走前，王翦要求秦王赏赐给自己大量良田美宅。秦王说：“将军即将出征了，为什么还要担忧生活会贫苦呢？”王翦说：“臣是大王的将军，曾经为国家立下过汗马功劳，却始终没有被封侯，所以趁大王委派臣重大任务的时候，请大王赏赐给臣良田美宅，这也是为了子孙后代打算啊。”秦始皇大笑。王翦抵达关口，还数次派使者回去向秦王要求赏赐。有人劝诫王翦说：“将军的要求是不是太过分了”。王翦说：“你不知道我的用意。大王疑心重，他用人却总是对人不放心。如今大王把秦国几乎所有的兵力都交给我，怎么会不对我有所猜疑呢。我多次向大王请求赏赐，不过是为了使大王安坐在宫中，不对我产生怀疑啊。”王翦使自己表现出贪财好利的样子，以此来安定秦王之心，这也是一种懂得敛藏自己锋芒的做法。</p>
<p>退一步之法，让三分之功</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人情反覆①，世路崎岖。行不去，须知退一步之法；行得去，务加让三分之功。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①人情反覆：是指人的情绪欲望，反复变化无常。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人世间的人情冷暖是变化无常的，人生的道路是崎岖不平的。因此当你遇到困难走不通时，必须明白退一步的为人之道；当你事业一帆风顺时，一定要有谦让三分的胸襟和美德。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>王维诗云：“人情翻覆似波澜。”唐婉的《钗头凤》也说：“世情恶，人情薄，雨送黄昏花易落。”</p>
<p>公元1145年，二十岁的陆游和表妹唐婉结为伴侣。按理讲，陆游唐婉两人，自幼青梅竹马，婚后相敬如宾。然而，进入陆家门的唐婉，因为不懂世故，得不到陆游母亲的喜爱，没少受委屈。最终陆游迫于孝道，在老母的百般干预下，和唐婉终是劳燕分飞。一对美满婚姻，就这样被家长活活拆散。由此可见，人情世故不可不知，一点不懂人情世故，最后难倒的会是自己。</p>
<p>为人处世还必须学会谦恭、礼让，不能处处都想占胜，不能事事都要露一手，难行的地方退一步或许会海阔天空。人生得意的时候也应把功劳让与别人些，不要居功自傲，不能得意忘形。何况人类的情感无比复杂，人心的变化也是奥妙无穷。今天认为是美的东西，明天就有可能认为是丑，今天认为是可爱的东西，明天就有可能是可恨。所谓“人情冷暖，世态炎凉”，也就是“人情反复，世路崎岖”的道理。</p>
<p>尤其世路多险阻，人生到处都有陷阱。这就要培养高度的谦让美德，遇到行不通的事不要勉强去做。换句话说，人生之路有高低、有曲折、有平坦，当你遇到挫折时必须鼓足勇气继续奋斗，当你事业飞黄腾达时，不要忘记救助那些穷苦的人，因为这样可以为你自己消除很多祸患于未然。这样，知退一步之法，明让三分之功，不仅是一种谦让美德，而且也是一种安身立命的善措。</p>
<p>待小人不恶，待君子有礼</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>待小人①不难于严，而难于不恶②；待君子不难于恭，而难于有礼。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①小人：泛指无知的人，此处指品行不端的坏人。</p>
<p>②恶：憎恨。《论语•里仁》篇：“惟仁者能好人能恶人。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>对待道德品行不端的小人，抱严厉的态度并不困难，困难的是内心不憎恨他们；对待品德高尚的君子，做到态度恭谨并不困难，困难的是做到真正发自内心的彬彬有礼。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>东汉陈实，字仲弓，颖川许县人，曾当过太丘县令，他在家乡为人公正。当年年荒民饥，有个小偷夜间潜入陈实的卧房，躲在房梁上窥伺，被陈实发觉。陈实并不惊动他，而是起身整了整自己的衣服，把儿孙唤到跟前，严肃地训导说：“人不能不知道自勉。那些恶人未必本来就坏，因为沾染了坏习惯，才达到了不知羞耻的地步。房梁上的君子就是这样的人。”</p>
<p>小偷一听，大吃一惊，慌忙跳下地来叩头请罪。陈实语气缓和地开导他说：“看你的模样，不像坏人，应该好好改掉自己的恶习，重新做个好人，你干这种事大概是由于贫穷所迫罢。”他吩咐家人取出二匹绢，送给了这位表示悔过的梁上君子。这事传开后，使那些有劣迹的人感到自愧，盗窃的事逐渐少了。</p>
<p>在中国历史上，郭子仪对于心术不正的小人来见他，纵然那些人的地位很卑微（郭子仪那时已封王），他一定见，而且一定坐得很端庄，穿上礼服来接见。有很多人觉得奇怪，就问他：“许多达官贵人来见你，你都很随便，为什么这些小职员来见你，你这样严肃？”郭子仪回答道：“这些人心术不正又很聪明，还很会巴结，不能得罪，万一他将来做了大官，得了志，我们得罪他，他怀恨在心会报复。”</p>
<p>他的话后来果然应验，擅长于巴结的这些人，很容易讨得主子的欢心，凡是得罪他的人，在他得志的时候都不会有好结果，有仇必报。郭子仪一生能够平平安安度过，有他的一套学问见识：对情感较薄的人要宽厚，对情感太丰富的人要方正，好比水太热要加点冷水，水冷了要加点热水。人既不能离群独居，处世就要中道，冷冰冰或热情过分都不好。我们何不保持超然的态度，免去世俗的污染，“对小人不恶，待众人有礼。”</p>
<p>读书见圣贤，居官爱子民</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>读书不见圣贤，如铅堑椠佣①；居官不爱子民，如衣冠盗②；讲学不尚躬行，如口头禅；立业不思种德，如眼前花。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①铅堑椠（qiàn）佣：抄写匠。铅，铅粉笔，指古人蘸铅粉点校或抄写文字之笔。堑，用以写字的木板。佣，雇来工作的人。</p>
<p>②衣冠盗：偷窃俸禄的官吏。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>读书只知一味背诵文句，而不去研究古圣先贤的思想精义，最多只能成为一个写字匠；做官如果不爱护人民，每天只知道领取国家的丰厚俸禄，那就像一个穿着官服戴着官帽的强盗。只知研究学问却不注重身体力行，那就像一个不懂佛理只会吟经的和尚；事业成功以后却不想为后人积一些阴德，那就像一朵艳丽却很快就凋谢的昙花。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古人治学，其目的并非只为懂得文章，最主要是自己能躬行实践所学得的学问，这就是通常所说的“学以致用”，用自己之所学贡献国家社会，假如学问跟实践不能相辅相成，那就变成了徒具形式的口头禅。例如一个修禅的人，即使天天绞尽脑汁在理论上苦斗，假如不彻底实践参禅悟道的真功夫，到头来连一点用处也没有。总而言之，读书如果不探求圣贤哲理，就不能算是学以致用；做官如果不爱护人民，就不能算是人民父母官；创立事业而不肯积阴德，就不能算是爱护自己子孙。</p>
<p>北宋开国元勋、一生被三次拜相的赵普自少熟谙史事，而缺乏学问。及至当了宰相，宋太祖劝他多多读书。从此，他每日退朝回家，手不释卷，尤其对《论语》通习甚精。宋太宗时，有人扬言赵普不学无术，仅仅读过《论语》一书。宋太宗询问赵普有无此事，赵普毫不隐讳地回答：“臣平生所知，诚不出此一书。昔日以半部《论语》佐太祖定天下，现在以半部《论语》辅陛下致太平。”所以后世遂有“半部论语治天下”之说。淳化三年（992年），赵普病卒，时年七十一岁。家人打开赵普书箱检视，内有《论语》二十篇。</p>
<p>像赵普这样读书读出思想，读出创造，才是真正的“读书见圣贤”。但是很多读书人不能真正明白这个道理，往往只满足于对现成书本的注释，满足于书本上的知识范围。要谨记：在书本知识之外，还要充分学会学以致用。</p>

<p>祸起于玩忽，功败于细微</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>酷烈之祸，多起于玩忽①之人；盛满之功，常败于细微之事。故语云：“人人道好，须防一人着恼；事事有功，须防一事不终。”</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①玩忽：不认真对待。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>那些严酷惨烈的灾祸，大多是因为不认真对待而发生的；那些看起来盛大圆满的功业，常常败坏在琐细微小的事情上而前功尽弃。所以古人说：“人人都说好，必须防备有一个人感到不满；事事都有功，必须防止有一件事不能善始善终。”</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古时候有一个铁匠打了一枚钉子，可钉子的火候不够，但是为了完成军队的任务他也没有在意地就交给了军队，军队后来把这枚钉子钉在了马鞍上面，最后这匹马在送军情的时候马鞍坏了，情报没有送到，于是战争失败了。这个故事一点也不夸张，事情就是这样：一枚不合格的钉子坏了一场战争。</p>
<p>由此可见细节的至关重要性。当代系统论认为，庞大的系统是由无数有机联系、彼此制约的细节构成的统一整体，忽视了细节，将导致系统整体的严重后果。细节决定成败，还在于因其“小”，往往被人忽视，掉以轻心；因其“细”，也常常使人感到繁琐，不屑一顾。但就是这些小事和细节，往往是事物发展的关键和突破口，是关系成败的双刃剑，万万大意不得。</p>
<p>上海地铁一号线是德国人设计的，看上去没有什么特别的地方，直到中国设计师设计的二号线投入运营，有了比较后，才发现一号线许多细节处理的良苦用心：一号线每一个出口处都设计了三个台阶，要进地铁口，必须踏上三级台阶，然后再往下进入地铁站，因为德国设计师注意到上海地势低，设计三个台阶就把雨水倒灌的问题解决了。一号线出口处都设计了一个转弯，看起来也是多此一举，二号线就处理成直行，但就是一号线的这个转弯细节，让冷暖气节省了很多，降低了很大的营运成本。</p>
<p>忽视细节，小损则会与众多商机失之交臂，大害则会毁掉一切。在浙江某地出产的冻虾仁被欧洲一些商家退了货，并且要求索赔。原因是欧洲当地检验部门从部分舟山冻虾中查到了十亿分之零点二克的氯霉素。经过自查，环节出在加工上，剥虾仁要靠手工，一些员工因为手痒难耐，用含氯霉素的消毒水止痒，结果将氯霉素带入了冻虾仁。这起事件，引起不少业内人士的关注。一则认为这是质量壁垒，10亿分之0.2克的含量已经细微到极致了，也不一定会影响人体，只是欧洲国家对农产品的质量要求太苛刻了；二则认为是素质壁垒，主要是国内农业企业员工的素质不高造成的；三则认为这是技术壁垒，当地冻虾仁加工企业和政府有关质检部门的安全检测技术太落后了，跟不上国外，根本检测不出这么微小的有毒物。但是，这十亿分之零点二表面上看起来是一次失误，其实却隐含着深刻的教训——疏忽细节。</p>
<p>君子立好言，君子行好事</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>春至时和①，花尚铺一段好色②，鸟且啭③几句好音。士君子幸列头角④，复遇温饱，不思立好言，行好事，虽是在世百年，恰似未生一日。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①时和：气候和暖。</p>
<p>②好色：美景。</p>
<p>③啭：鸟的叫声，发出宛转悠扬声。</p>
<p>④头角：指气象峥嵘，比喻才华出众。有崭露头角的意思。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当春天到来时阳光拂照气候和暖，就连花草树木也争奇斗艳，给大地铺上一层美丽的景色，甚至连飞鸟也懂得在这春光明媚的大自然中唱出几句宛转悠扬的歌声。一个有才华的士君子假如侥幸出人头地身居高位，酒足饭饱过上豪华的生活，却不想为后世子孙挥写下几部不朽名著，做一些有益于世人的事，那他即使活到一百岁的高寿也如同一天都没活过。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>儒家倡导通过对“立德、立功、立言”的“三不朽”的追求来实现死亡超越。中国传统文化中的“三不朽”，最早见于《左传•襄公二十四年》：“太上有立德，其次有立功，其次有立言，虽久不废，此之谓不朽。”“立德”、“立功”、“立言”的现代解读可以理解为“做人、做事、做文章”。一个人，可能做不成大事，但不可以不做事；可能做不成许多事，但不可以不努力做成几件事。身前重名，身后重誉，尤其是对当权者来说，声誉取决于政绩的好坏。宋儒张载说：“为天下立心，为生民立命，为往圣继绝学，为万世开太平。”君子幸列头角，能为平民百姓请命是为清官，能为国家兴利除弊是为贤达，能为后人著书是为贤哲。</p>
<p>魏晋南北朝时期，魏朝的杨逸从小努力读书，勤学好问，二十九岁时就被魏庄帝授任为吏部郎中、平西将军、南秦州刺史、散骑常侍。以他这样的年龄而被委以如此重任，还从未有过先例。此后，又被调任平东将军、光州刺吏。</p>
<p>杨逸在任光州刺史时，为治理光州，费尽心思，不辞劳苦，为办理公务，夜不安寝，食不甘味，倚仗年轻，常常不分昼夜。他懂得，要想天下太平，必须争取民心，而要想获得民心，必须问民疾苦，从点滴做起。因此，每当州中有人被征召从军，他一定要亲自送行，有时风吹日晒，有时雪飘雨狂，许多人都坚持不住，他却毫无倦意。治政、治军要讲究宽猛相济、恩威并施，杨逸也熟谙此道。他仁爱百姓，又法令严明，恶徒狂贼都不敢在州中惹是生非，全州境内，上下肃然。他最恨那些豪强奸诈之徒，在州中四处布下耳目，随时监督，稍有动静就立即剪除。他以严格的纪律约束部属，手下的官吏士兵到下面办事，都自带口粮。如有人摆下饭菜招待，即使在密室，也不敢答应，问其缘由，都说杨逸有千里眼，明察秋毫，哪个做了错事能瞒得过？</p>
<p>杨逸非常关心百姓疾苦。当时因连年灾荒，饿死很多人，杨逸见状，心急如焚，决定开仓放粮赈灾，救百姓于水火之中，可管粮的官吏惧怕私自动用国库存粮会招致大祸，执意不肯。杨逸也明白，不经上奏批准，擅自发粮，如果朝廷怪罪，将有生命之虞。可是要按常规具文请奏，等待批答，文书往来，颇费时日，不知又要饿死多少百姓，宁可获罪，也要放粮。随即果断下令开仓，将粟米发给了饱受饥饿煎熬的百姓。然后，杨逸马上写好奏章，向朝廷申说详情。</p>
<p>奏章送到朝中，庄帝与君臣议事，以右仆射元罗为首的大臣认为国库储粮不可轻易动用，杨逸之请，应予驳回。尚书令、临淮王元或则认为形势紧急，应贷粮二万。最后庄帝恩准二万。</p>
<p>杨逸放粮后，还有为数不少的老幼病残者仍难活命，他便派人在州门口摆上了大锅煮粥，施舍给这些人，使之不致饿死。杨逸之举，无异雪中送炭，解民于倒悬，那些即将饿死而因杨逸及时赈济终于活了下来的百姓竟然数以万计，庄帝闻听事情本末，也以为处置得宜，连连称赞。</p>
<p>后来，年仅三十二岁的杨逸惨遭家祸。全州上下，士吏百姓，听到凶讯后，如同失去了自己的亲人一般悲哀，城镇村落都摆斋设祭，追悼这位年轻仁爱的刺史，竟然一个月始终没有断绝。</p>
<p>裴多菲曾说：“生命的多少用时间计算，生命的价值用贡献计算。”像杨逸这样献毕生于家国百姓，真乃君子士人的大贤哲也。</p>
<p>愿种德施惠，勿贪权市宠</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>平民肯种德①施惠，便是无位的卿相②；士夫③徒贪权市宠④，竟成有爵的乞人。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①种德：积德行善。</p>
<p>②卿相：执政的大臣，公卿将相等。</p>
<p>③士夫：士大夫。</p>
<p>④贪权市宠：贪求权力，博取别人的喜爱或恩宠。市：买卖的意思。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个平民老百姓如果愿意尽自己的能力广积恩德广施恩惠，他虽然没有公卿相国的名位，却同样受到世人景仰；那些有高官厚禄的士大夫们如果只是一味地争夺权势贪恋名声，虽然有着公卿爵位，却像一个讨饭的乞丐一样可悲。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>平民百姓如果肯多做善事，广结善缘，其行为好比是没有爵位的公卿将相。种德施惠其实与自己的社会地位和身份财产等都没有太大关系。只要有心，无论什么样的人都能力所能及地帮助别人。就像一个笑话中讲的那样，有一个流浪汉在公园里睡觉，这时候有一对情侣在公园里约会。突然有几个歹徒跑了出来，抢劫这对情侣的财物，与这对情侣搏斗起来。他们谁都没有注意流浪汉，流浪汉站起身来，来到公园中设置的公园电话旁边，拨打110报警电话。等到警察赶到之后，那对情侣对打报警电话的人很是感激，却不知道打电话的人就是在不远处安睡的流浪汉。这虽然是一个笑话，却也说明只要肯去做，那么无论处在什么样的境况下，都能够种德施惠。</p>
<p>身居高位如果只知道谋取权力，只知道讨好当权者以便获得宠信，这种行为也就和乞丐差不多了，只不过比普通的乞丐拥有爵位罢了。只知道贪图权力，这种人不会有什么远大的见识。明武帝的时候，宁王的后代宸濠倾慕唐六如的才华，派人送金子给唐六如，想请他做官。唐六如接受了宸濠的礼品，来到宸濠身边，受到宸濠的优待。唐六如住了一段时间后，发现宸濠常常做一些不合法的事情，猜想宸濠大概是想造反。于是唐六如装疯卖傻，想躲避开宸濠。有一次，宸濠派人送礼物给唐六如，看到他疯疯癫癫的样子，送礼的人只好带着礼物回去了。宸濠知道这件事后说：“原来唐六如是个疯子。”于是就把唐六如放回家。不久宸濠果然造反了。宸濠身为权贵，却只知道谋取权力，自己的才德又不足，所以落得失败的下场。唐六如看出宸濠的野心，及早与宸濠划清界限，最终避开了祸患。</p>
<p>敦旧扶公议，谨庸种阴德</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>市①私恩，不如扶公议②；结新知，不如敦③旧好；立荣名，不如种阴德；尚奇节，不如谨庸行④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①市：买卖。</p>
<p>②扶公议：公议是社会舆论；扶是扶持。</p>
<p>③敦：厚，这里指加深。</p>
<p>④庸行：平常行为。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人与其收买人心而施恩惠给别人，那还不如以光明磊落的态度去争取社会大众的舆论；一个人与其结交很多不能劝善规过的新朋友，倒不如加深一下跟老朋友之间的情谊；一个人与其沽名钓誉、想法提高知名度，倒不如悄悄在暗中积一些阴德；一个人与其标新立异去显示名节，倒不如平日谨言慎行多做一些平凡无奇的好事。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>往往有很多民意代表开辟所谓“民众时间”，标榜为民服务，其中真为民众服务的人固然有，但是沽名钓誉的也大有人在。这种伪君子比真小人更可恨，因为他们根本没有悬壶济世的本领却硬要悬壶，使得很多有苦处的人不远千里奔波而向他们求救，但是他们最后总是找出一些看似合理实际根本不合理的理由搪塞了事。这种不知积德的小人，任何虚伪标榜都只是徒增人们对他们的不满与怨恨。</p>
<p>崇本尚义固然是应当做的，但不必做出受人注目的奇特节行，只要能够注意日常的行动，做到无过的行为，忠实地守住现在的岗位，谨慎平常的言行，就可以加深进德修业的基础了。</p>
<p>宋孝宗乾道四年，人民缺乏粮食，朱熹求救于州府，借到常平米六百石来施救，夏天从社里的谷仓借米粮，冬天加利息偿还。歉收时免除一半利息，大饥荒时利息全免。十四年后，六百石米全数还给州府，尚有储米三千一百石，做为社仓，不再收利息。所以虽然遭到歉收，人民也不担心缺乏粮食。孝宗于是下诏，使朱熹的社仓法在各路推行。</p>
<p>陆象山评此说：“社仓固然是为农民的利益着想，然而要常年丰收，这种制度才可保持长久，如果不是可常年丰收的田地，一遇到歉收，则社仓的米只有借出而没有收入，来年播种时缺少种子，仍然没有办法施救。不如同时设立一个平籴仓，丰收时买入米粮，防止价贱伤农的祸害；歉收时出售米粮，以防止富家屯积粮食，抬高价格来获取暴利。把买进来的米粮分存两个仓库，其中一个仓库的存粮保留起来，不随便使用，以为歉收的年头所用，用这种方法来替代动辄匮乏的社会，显然比较实用。”</p>
<p>顺从人民的方便，是社仓法；强制人民听从的，则是青苗法。是因为前者主张利民，后者主张利国的缘故。</p>
<p>官吏积存谷物的方法，也是社仓的遗训。然而所积的只是纸上的空言，一半已被负责官吏据为己有，一半变成朝廷非正常调用的钱粮来源。一碰到荒年歉收，除了摇头叹息，一点办法也没有，还不如不要设置，单纯地把谷物留在民间的好。</p>
<p>明朝何良俊于《四友斋丛说》说：“当今地方首长的真正德政，当务之急是将各项赃款及罚银，督促各府县隶全数购买谷物。犯徒刑、流放以下的罪犯，准他们用谷物来赎罪。大致上大县每年要买谷一万石，小县要买五千石。两直隶巡抚之下有一百个县，则每年就有七十多万石谷物。累积三年之后，就有两百多万石了。如果遇到一个县有水旱灾，就向无灾害的县通融借贷，来年丰收补还，则各地百姓就免于流离逃难，而朝廷对那些供应政府财政支出的重点税收地区，也永远不需忧心荒年歉收的问题。最大的德政，没有比这样更好了。”</p>
<p>不犯公正论，不走权门窦</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>公平正论不可犯①手，一犯手则贻羞万世；权门私窦②不可著脚③，一著脚则玷污④终身。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①犯手：触犯、违犯。</p>
<p>②私窦：窦是储藏粮食的窖，壁间的小门也叫窦。私窦就是私门，即走后门。</p>
<p>③著脚：踏进去。</p>
<p>④玷污：指美誉受污损。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>凡是社会大众所公认的规范和法律绝对不可以触犯，一旦不小心或故意触犯了，你就会遗臭万年；凡是权贵营私舞弊的地方，千万不可踏进一步，万一不小心或故意走进去，那你清白的人格就一辈子也洗刷不清。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个有操守讲气节的人，宁可穷困死也不走后门依附权贵，因为那种阿谀奉承达官贵人的言行做起来实在可悲。尤其是权势之家唯利是图，他们对人的态度是雁过拔毛。所谓雁过拔毛，意思就是当大雁凌空飞过时，他们都必须拔下一根毛，比喻为人把钱看得太厉害，只要有求于他或接近他时，他必然借机敲诈，假如不给他，也绝不会轻易放过。如果接受他的需索而行贿，那清白人格就会受到玷污，从此终身难以洗清。所谓“一失足成千古恨，再回头已百年身”，就最能说明这种“犯公论贻羞万年，依权门玷污终身”的道理。</p>
<p>晋朝张翰辞去大司马府高级官员的职务，对同郡的顾荣说：“天下纷乱不安，拥有盛名的人，想要退隐都很艰难。我本来就是乡野之人，性好闲适，早已不求一时的名望。你要好好的以你的聪明防患于未然，用你的智慧预留后路。”顾荣拉着张翰的手，说：“我也很想和你一起退隐，自在地去采拾山间的野菜，喝江河中的清水。”张翰有一天看到秋风吹起，想起吴中（江苏吴县）的莼菜羹、鲈鱼脍，说：“人生的可贵在于能够适情适性罢了。怎么能被羁留在离故乡数千里外的地方，为的只是虚名爵位？”于是叫人驾车赶回故乡，不久，齐王败亡，许多人都说张翰有先见之明。晋朝还有这样一件事。晋朝裴颇推荐韦忠给张华，张华要任韦忠为官，他却以疾病为由辞谢。别人问他原因，他说：“张华为人虚华，裴颇贪多而不满足，两人都不顾礼法依附贾后，我时时担忧他们会遭覆败，波及到我，怎么可以再撩起衣裳，不知顾忌地来接近他们呢？”后来张华果然遭祸，如韦忠所预言一般。</p>
<p>张翰、韦忠两人不依附权贵，所以临祸不遭殃，保持了清白的人格。一失足成千古恨，再回头已是百年身。人的一生应修德养性，做自己应该做的事情。</p>
<p>高士访隐图</p>
<p>当锄奸杜幸，须留他去路</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>锄奸杜①幸②，要放他一条去路。若使之一无所容，便如塞鼠穴者，一切去路都塞尽，则一切好物都咬破矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①杜：杜绝，制止。</p>
<p>②幸：奸佞。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>铲除奸诈凶恶的人，要给他们留下一条活路。如果使他们毫无生路，就像堵塞老鼠洞那样，把老鼠洞的所有出路都堵住了，老鼠就会把一切完好的东西都咬坏，奸诈凶恶之辈也会极力做坏事，把一切好东西都破坏掉。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说“狗急了跳墙，兔子急了咬人”，铲除恶势力，也需要给他们留有一条生路。如果斩尽杀绝，把他们逼上绝路，那么他们就会尽一切所能搞破坏。《智囊》上讲，宋哲宗时，王安石变法失败，恢复了以前的旧制度。这时候跟随王安石变法的革新派等人遭受到严厉的打击，有的被贬官，有的被监禁起来，朝廷还把他们的名单公布出来。范纯仁叹息说：“这样下去，将来我们这些人怕是会遭到报复。”后来革新派又掌握了权力，果然对旧党的处理也非常严酷。对敌人过于严苛，那么一有机会敌人也会反过来更加凶狠地报复。</p>
<p>吕公孺在永兴当太守，部队要迁移，这时候有一些士兵因为当兵太久了，非常思念家乡。于是这些士兵举起武器要打开关门，没有成功，他们就向西边的渡桥走去，准备从那里逃走。部下请求带兵把这些逃兵抓回来。吕公孺却说：“这些人都是亡命之徒，如果把他们逼急了，就会发生叛乱。”于是吕公孺亲自前往桥边，对几个闹事的士兵说：“我知道你们确实很辛苦，但是也不可以擅自回家。如果你们过了这座桥，就犯下不可饶恕的罪行了。现在停止还来得及。”逃兵们都停了下来，吕公孺找出带头闹事的人，对此人施以处罚。其余的士兵都回去照旧服役，从此安静服帖起来。吕公孺对待闹事的士兵，采用了为士兵考虑，并不斩尽杀绝的方式，由此收到了比较好的效果。由此可见，我们在生活中，遇到竞争对手的时候，也需要为对方留有一定余地。给对手留一条路，也是为自己留一条路。</p>
<p>事业随身毁，精神万古新</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>事业文章，随身销毁，而精神万古如新；功名富贵，逐世转移，而气节千载一时。君子信不以彼易①此也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①易：交换，替换。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当人死后，事业与文章都随着人肉身的死亡而消亡，而高尚的精神却能万古如新。无论经历多少时间，高尚的精神依然大放光彩；功名富贵都随着时代的变迁而转移，而忠贞爱国的气节却经历千年如一日，不会发生改变。君子确实不会因贪图事业文章与功名富贵而丧失高尚的精神与气节。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生在世不过区区几十年，长寿的人也不过百岁多光阴。几十年中，无论文章做得多么精妙，无论事业功名多么显赫辉煌，当人死后这些身外之物也随着人肉身的死亡而渐渐销声匿迹。功名富贵无论当时怎样宏大丰厚，没有人能葆有千年富贵，甚至葆有百年富贵都不是那么容易。流传下来的是高尚的精神，坚贞可贵的气节。在事业文章、功名富贵与高尚精神及忠贞气节之间选择，君子决不会为了前两者而放弃精神与气节。</p>
<p>中华历史上流传下来的文章很多，在这一点上似乎与本段的说法相左。实际上那些在历史上大放光彩、流传千载的文章，都不会只是因为文字华丽、文章巧妙，而是其中蕴含的高尚精神激励着一代又一代人。屈原的《离骚》，诸葛亮的《出师表》，文天祥的《过零丁洋》，这些文章诗歌吸引人的正是其中蕴含的爱国激情。</p>
<p>与事业功名相比，更注重精神气节，无论哪个时代，中华民族都不缺乏这样的人。蔡景濂教授是一位英籍华人，是培育甜菊与甘茶蔓的专家。他在香港有着优越的生活，他的技术吸引着许多外国老板，他们想买他的技术。蔡教授拒绝了外国老板的购买要求，从生活条件优越的香港来到内地某处条件艰苦的地方，他想在中国内地培育甜菊与甘茶蔓。外国专家曾说中国无法培植甜菊与甘茶蔓，蔡教授不信这个说法，经过他的不懈努力，克服了重重困难与阻力，终于在中国培植成功甜菊与甘茶蔓，推动了中国生物工程的发展。蔡教授为此付出很多，从前他有自己的汽车、能享受各种美味佳肴、居住条件十分优越，而当他到内地工作时，一段时间只能骑自行车、吃鸡蛋青菜、住宿条件很简陋。一腔爱国热情，支持着他为祖国无私奉献。中华民族有无数如蔡教授一般热爱祖国，不计较名利和个人得失的爱国人士。</p>
<p>谢世于盛时，居身于独后</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>谢世①当谢于正盛之时，身宜居于独后②之地；德须谨于至微之事，恩务施于不报之人。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①谢世：辞官隐退。</p>
<p>②独后：与世无争，自己甘当最后。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>辞官隐退应当在事业兴盛、官运亨通的时候；平时处身应当选在一个与世无争的幽静之所；谨慎修炼自己的德行，必须注意细小的事情；施予恩惠，一定要包括那些不报恩德的人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《道德经》言：“功成名遂身退，天之道。”然而“功成名就”虽为好事，但是处理不好的话，也会引发祸端。凡事发展到顶峰，随后而来的就是衰退和败落，物极必反也正是这个道理。所以人应当见好即收，急流勇退。</p>
<p>西汉人疏广，任太子太傅。疏广哥哥的儿子疏受，任太子少傅。任职五年以后，疏广对疏受说：“我听人说过，知道满足的人不会受到侮辱，也不会遭受危险，成就了功名隐退，这是一种明智之举。而今你我也功成名就，现在不离开，恐怕会后悔的。”</p>
<p>他们叔侄二人以身体有病为名，向皇帝上书，请求告老还乡养病，回家安度晚年。皇帝同意了，并赐给他们黄金20斤，太子赐给他们黄金50斤，大臣和朋友们在京城外举行送别仪式，送他们的共100多辆车子。路上看热闹的人都说：“这两个大夫，真是贤明的人。”</p>
<p>疏广叔侄二人，知道进退，一旦条件有变就退下来，以保全自己已获得的成就。他们正是知道及时归隐，不仅保全了利益，还获得了世人的称赞。</p>
<p>寒尽暑来，变化更替不止，这是自然界的变化规律。只知道前进，而不知退守之意，极有可能会盛极而衰，甚至把命都搭进去。</p>
<p>李斯在秦国为官，官拜丞相之位，可谓富贵集于一身，叱咤风云，不可一世，然而最终却否极泰来，做了阶下囚。</p>
<p>临刑时，他对儿子说：“吾欲与若复牵黄犬，出上蔡东门，逐狡免，忌可得乎？”不仅丞相没得做了，连做一个布衣百姓与儿子外出狩猎的机会也没有了，这是多么典型的一个事例！可惜李斯在没有身败名裂之时，没有领会“谢世当谢于正盛之时”的真谛。</p>
<p>建功多虚圆，失机必执拗</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>建功立业者，多虚圆①之士，偾事②失机者，必执拗之人。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①虚圆：谦虚谨慎、圆通机变。</p>
<p>②偾事：败事。据《礼记•大学》：“一家仁，一国兴仁；一家让，一国兴让；一人贪戾，一国作乱，其机如此。此谓一言僨事，一人定国。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>凡是能够建立功业成就功勋的人，多是谦虚圆滑灵活应变的人，凡是惹事生非遇事坐失良机的人，一定是那种性格执拗骄傲自满的人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子说：有向学之志的人，未必能取得某种成就；取得某种成就的人，未必做每件事都合乎原则；做每件事都合乎原则的人，未必懂得根据实际情况灵活变通。</p>
<p>有一位满腹经纶的学者，为了了解禅学的奥妙，不远千里去拜访一位禅师。禅师在桌上准备了两只斟满茶水的杯子，然后坐下，开始讲解佛学的精义。学者听着听着，觉得其中某些话似曾相识，好像也不是什么高深的理论。他曾听人说这位禅师道行高深，从他的话语中能够得到很多启发，但是交谈之下并不觉得他有什么特殊之处，于是认为这位禅师不过是浪得虚名，骗骗一般凡夫俗子而已。学者越想越觉得心浮气躁，坐立不安，不但在禅师的讲道中不停地插话，甚至轻蔑地说：“哦，这个我早就知道了。”</p>
<p>禅师并没有出言指责学者的不逊，他只是停了下来，拿起茶壶再次替这位学者斟茶，尽管茶杯里的茶还剩下八分满，禅师却没有把杯子里的茶倒出，只是不断在茶杯中注入温热的茶水，直到茶水不停地从杯中溢出，流得满地都是。</p>
<p>这位学者见状，连忙提醒大师说：“别倒了，杯子已经满了，根本装不下了。”</p>
<p>禅师听了放下茶壶，不愠不火地说：“是啊！如果你不先把原来的茶杯倒干净，又怎么能品尝我现在倒给你的茶呢？”</p>
<p>谦恭有度，讲的是君子的情操和待人接物的态度。君子待人要谦，对待长辈更要恭谦有礼，但也不可谦虚过度，过谦则使人感觉到虚伪狡诈。只有虚怀若谷的态度，才能给人尊敬的印象，敬人者人恒敬之，人们也会对谦虚者抱以尊敬。谦虚是高尚者修养深厚的表现，是圣人君子的操守。</p>

<p>大人①不可不畏，畏大人则无放逸之心；小民亦不可不畏，畏小民则无豪横之名。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①大人：有道德声望的人。据《论语•季氏》篇：“畏大人。注：‘大人，圣人也。”或指有官位的人。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>对于有高深道德修养的人不可不抱有敬畏的态度，因为敬畏有道德有名望的人就不会有放纵安逸的想法；对于平民百姓也不可不抱有敬畏的态度，因为敬畏平民百姓就不会有豪强蛮横的恶名。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>齐桓公问管仲道：“当君主的人，以什么为贵？”管仲说：“以天为贵。”桓公仰而视天，不得其意。管仲说：“我所说的天，并非苍天。君主，应以百姓为天。百姓拥护，就能安宁；百姓辅佐，就能强盛；百姓反对，就很危险；百姓背弃，就要灭亡。如果百姓聚在一起埋怨国君而国家不亡，那是没有的事。”齐王派使者到赵国去聘问威后，威后未及打开书信，便问使者：“今年收成好吗？你们的百姓好吗？齐王也还好吗？”使者很不高兴，不解地问道：“我奉命出使赵国聘问威后，现在您不先问齐王如何，而先问年成与百姓，这岂不是把微贱者放在前面，把尊贵者摆在后面了吗？”威后回答说：“不是这样。如果没有年成，怎么会有百姓？如果没有百姓，怎么会有国君？哪有丢开根本而去问细微末节的呢？”</p>
<p>孟子说：“民为贵，社稷次之，君为轻。是故得乎丘民为天子，得乎天子为诸侯，得乎诸侯为大夫。”</p>
<p>荀子也曾有言：马惊车了，坐在车内的人就不安稳；百姓惊惧政事，君主在职位上就不安稳。所以，做君主的不能不爱民如子。</p>
<p>径路窄退步，滋味短清淡</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>争先①的径路窄，退后一步自宽平一步；浓艳的滋味短，清淡一分自悠长一分。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①争先：争强好胜。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>与人争强好胜时就会觉得道路狭窄，如果能够退后一步让人先行，自然会觉得道路宽广很多；追求浓艳华丽而享受到的滋味是短暂的，如果能清淡一分，自然会觉得滋味更加弥香。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>假如世人都能抱有“径路窄退步，滋味短清淡”的人生观，人与人之间就不会有那么多纠纷了。但事实上很难，因为好胜之心人皆有之。这就存在一个适时的问题，即在什么样的条件下应该争胜，什么样的情况下应该退让。做人贵在自然，做事不可强求，在大是大非面前，在天下兴亡的大义面前，不争何待？在名利场中，在富贵乡中，在人际是非面前，退一步让一下有何不好？</p>
<p>外国人做智力测验，在瓶子里装上三个系线的彩球，让三个孩子同时拉，看他们最短需要多少时间。走遍世界，所有孩子都不能在一秒钟拉出。但中国的孩子做到了，因为三个孩子很团结，他们先安排下顺序，然后再依次拉出。由此可见，礼让包容会使大家都得到好处，而争斗只会使所有的人都受伤害。</p>
<p>林肯总统对政敌素以宽容著称，后来终于引起一议员的不满，议员说：“你不应该试图和那些人交朋友，而应该消灭他们。”林肯微笑着回答：“当他们变成我的朋友，难道我不正是在消灭我的敌人吗？”一语中的，多一些宽容，公开的对手或许就是我们潜在的朋友。</p>
<p>孔子也说：“不要只怪别人不赏识自己，更要担心自己能力不够。不愁没有人知道我，该愁我有什么可为人知道的。”曾子也说：“与人同游而不被人所爱，必是自己仁心不厚，与人相交而不被人所敬，必是自己长者之风不足，自己有不足而怨别人不好，不是很无道理吗？”生活中我们时刻为人所用，甚至为人所迫。只有摒弃一切隔膜，留下一个包容的台阶，为了别人，也为了自己，这样会给别人一个改过的机会，这一举动虽然平淡无奇，却是另一个新的开始。</p>
<p>进步思退步，着手图放手</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>进步处便思退步，庶免触藩之①祸；着手时先图放手，才脱骑虎之势②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①触藩：形容进退两难。在《易经》中有“羊触藩，不能退，不能遂”（遂，即前进）之句。</p>
<p>②骑虎之势：骑虎难下，形容做事不能停下。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在事情发展顺利的时候，应当考虑以后引退的事情，以避免将来像羊角夹在篱笆中，不能前进也不能后退，陷入进退两难的窘境；开始一件事情的时候，就先考虑好什么时候放手不做，这样才能避免骑虎难下的危险。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生在世需要知道进退之道，能进则进，不能进则退步。世界万物处在永不止歇的变化发展之中，任何事业都不可能长盛不衰，任何人都不可能长生不老。事业发展顺利，功业圆满的时候，应看到事业不可能长盛不衰，自己不可能一直保持旺盛精力。能够积极进取，也能够及时抽身隐退，这样才能避免危险，避免陷入进退两难的窘境。知道进退，该退步时就退步，这是一种能够认清形势，能够审时度势的聪明做法。</p>
<p>中外历史中有不少名人，正是由于不知道进退，最终落得失败的下场。拿破仑是一位世界闻名的军事怪杰，他出生在法国一个没落的小贵族家庭中。身材矮小，家境一般的拿破仑，建立了辉煌的战绩。他建立法兰西帝国，自己当上了帝王，不断发动对外战争。在一段时期内，拿破仑率领的军队所向披靡、战无不胜，打败欧洲各大国。一时之间，拿破仑得意非凡，他的雄心大志与野心也跟着更加膨胀。最终，拿破仑在一次对俄战争中受挫，这次失败成为拿破仑人生转折点。在滑铁卢战役中，拿破仑被打败，从此一蹶不振，被流放到大西洋一个小岛上。拿破仑的失败，是许多因素造成的，其中他只知道进不知道退是造成他失败的一个不可忽视的因素。处理事情，全面考虑最终选择一种最恰当的处理方式，必要时学会抽身放手。</p>
<p>三友图</p>
<p>世态倏忽变，不宜认太真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人情世态倏忽①万端，不宜认得太真。尧夫②曰：“昔日所云我，今朝却是伊。不知今日我，又属后来谁？”人常作是观，便可解却胸中罥③矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①倏忽：形容极其短的时间。</p>
<p>②尧夫：邵雍字尧夫，北宋理学家。</p>
<p>③罥（juàn）：捕捉鸟兽的网，这里有牵挂、心结的意思。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人情世态是瞬息万变的，所以不宜对任何事情都过于执着认真。邵雍说：“以前说的我，现在却成了他。不知道今天的我，将来又会变成什么样？”人如果能够经常这样看待世界，那么就能消除很多烦恼了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个老财主，年轻时候的他很贫穷，村上的富家子弟常常欺辱他。他很生气，甚至想跟他们打一架——但他的父母总是制止他，并让他绕着自家的土地跑三圈。如果他的气还没有消，他会继续被父母惩罚绕着自家的土地跑圈，直至他不再生气。</p>
<p>后来，他保留了这个习惯——每当与别人生气时，他就绕着自家的土地跑圈。值得一提的是，年轻时他也许要用跑十圈的时间才能消除内心的怒火，中年时则只需要五圈或者三圈，现在，他生气时，想一想这事，他的一切怒火都会平息——他已经不用跑圈了。</p>
<p>他的孙子很不明白，想得到他不生气的秘诀。他捋着胡须，笑着说：“很简单，年轻时，绕着土地跑，越跑我发现我的土地越小，于是我想：我的土地这么小，财富这么少，我哪有时间和精力跟别人斗气呢？后来我的土地越来越多，跑一会儿我就想：我的财富这么多，土地这么大，我用得着跟别人斗气吗？”</p>
<p>这是个关于如何解脱得到快乐的故事。人情冷暖，世态炎凉，瞬息万变，都不必看得那么认真。邵雍说：“以前说的我，现在却成了他。不知道今天的我，将来又会变成什么样？”都说幸福之门是虚掩着的，但听了这个关于快乐的故事，我们发现，快乐之门其实也是虚掩着的——只要我们在现实生活中，适时地向自己问一句：我的财富这么少，我哪有时间和精力和别人斗气呢？或者：我的财富这么多，我用得着跟别人斗气吗？放下心中的负累，不要再为它心事重重、阴霾不开，挺起胸、抬起头看看人生各处的风景，烦恼自然远离，虚掩着的快乐之门也就随之打开了。</p>
<p>近势利不染，知智巧不用</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>势利①纷华②，不近者为洁，近之而不染者为尤洁；智巧机械③，不知者为高，知之而不用者为尤高。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①势利：权势和财利，《汉书•张耳陈余传》说：“势利之交，古人羞之。”</p>
<p>②纷华：富丽堂皇。</p>
<p>③智械机巧：用心计，使权谋。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>面对世间众多追逐名利的恶行，不去接近权势和财利的人是志向高洁的，而接近了权势和财利却又能不为之所动的人，品格更为高尚；面对权谋术数，不知道它奸滑手段的人固然是高尚的，而懂得了却不去用这种手段的人，才更加高尚可贵。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人人都渴望得到权势名利，富贵荣华。为了得到这些可望而不可及的虚妄名利，某些人甚至不择手段、铤而走险。可是人世间，有正必有邪，有君子必有小人，邪可能一时占上风，但是邪不压正，小人即使一时得志，也难以长久，小人终究盖不过品行端正的君子。历史上这样的事例俯拾皆是。</p>
<p>鲁国大夫柳下惠从不拒绝在昏庸的国君手下做宾客，他位列朝臣从不隐藏自己的才能，就算是遭到国君的罢免也从不怨恨，穷困也不忧愁，与人相处，也从不会故意近君子远小人。他曾说：“你是你，我是我，你纵然在我身边赤身露体，又哪能沾染我呢？”柳下惠的这一做派很受孟子的欣赏，他认为柳下惠风节行止，与柳下惠相处，胸怀狭小的人也会变得宽大起来，为人刻薄的人也能厚道起来。</p>
<p>对于柳下惠这种近朱者不赤，近墨者不黑的品格，与北宋著名学者周敦颐的《爱莲说》所阐发的精神最是契合。文中说：水里边和陆地上的草木，开的花招人喜欢的是很多的。很多人喜爱菊花，又有很多人偏爱牡丹花，我却喜欢莲花。我喜欢莲花从污泥中生长出来，自己却不被沾染，莲花在清水中洗过，却不显得妖艳。它不生藤蔓，也不长旁枝，气味清香，人们可以远远地欣赏它，但不能玩弄它。我看，菊花是花中的隐士，牡丹是花中的富贵者，莲花才是花中君子呀！</p>
<p>可是，随着思想观念的不断更新，人们对物质的欲望和要求越来越高，能做到“近之而不染，知之而不用”的人也来越少，对于那些有机会把握权力，掌握金钱，却依旧保持高洁，不因身居高位而贪污，不因手握重金而堕落的人，是非常难能可贵的了。</p>
<p>燠趋寒则弃，人情之通患</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>饥则附，饱则扬；燠①则趋，寒则弃，人情通患②也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①燠（yù）：温暖，此形容富贵人家。《说文•无衣》：“安且燠兮。”</p>
<p>②患：毛病。柳宗元《愈膏肓赋》：“愈膏肓之患难。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>穷困饥饿时就去投靠人家，富裕饱足时就远走高飞，遇到有钱的人家时就去巴结，当人家衰败贫穷时就掉头鄙弃，这是一般人都会有的人情通病。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>春秋时晋中行文子逃亡，经过一个县城。侍从说：“这里有大人的老朋友，为什么不休息一下，等待后面的车子呢？”文子说：“我爱好音乐，这个朋友就送我名琴；我喜爱美玉，这个朋友就送我玉环。这是个只会投合我来求取好处而不会规劝我改过的人。我怕他也会用以前对我的方法去向别人求取好处。”于是迅速离开。后来这个朋友果然扣下文子后面的两部车子献给他的新主子。</p>
<p>蔺相如（战国赵人）曾为宦者缪贤的家臣。缪贤犯罪，计划逃到燕国。蔺相如问他：“您怎么知道燕王一定会接纳您呢？”缪贤说：“我曾陪着大王在边境上和燕王聚会，燕王握着我的手说愿意和我交朋友。因而想去燕国。”蔺相如阻止他说：“赵国强盛而燕国弱小，您以前受赵王宠幸，所以燕王才想巴结您；现在您要逃离赵国到燕国去，燕王畏惧赵王，一定不敢留您，反而会抓您来讨好赵王。您不如自己向赵王请罪，也许还有机会免罪。”缪贤依计而行。</p>
<p>通过这两个故事，我们更深彻地认识到“事态有冷暖，人面逐高低”。据《史记•汲郑列传》记载：“夫以汲、郑之贤，有势则宾客十倍，无势则否，况众人乎！始翟公为廷尉，宾客满门，及废，门外可设雀罗。翟公复为廷尉，宾客欲往，翟公乃大署其门曰：一死一生，及知交情。一贫一富，及知交态。一贵一贱，交情乃见。”这里所说的“一贫一富乃知交态，一贵一贱交情乃见”，就证明了所有这些都是一般人最容易犯的通病，因此谚语才有“贫居闹市无人问，富在深山有远亲”的说法。</p>
<p>闻牧唱樵歌，述嘉言懿行</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>交市人，不如友山翁；谒朱门①，不如亲白屋②；听街谈巷语，不如闻牧唱樵歌；谈今人失德过差③，不如述古人嘉言懿行④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①朱门：比喻富贵之家。杜甫诗：“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨。”</p>
<p>②白屋：贫穷人家住的地方。借指平民、寒士。</p>
<p>③过差：错误的行为。</p>
<p>④懿行：善行。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>交一个市井凡俗的朋友，不如同一个山野老翁做朋友；与其去拜谒达官贵人，还不如亲近普通的平民百姓；谈论街头巷尾的是是非非，还不如多听听樵夫的民谣和牧童的山歌；与其议论现代人违背道德的行为和过失的举动，还不如多讲述一些古代圣贤的嘉言善行。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人要修身洁行，就应尽量少一分俗气，多一分朴实。俗人难免做俗事，但俗事也有通俗与庸俗之别。沾染庸俗之气者，巴望结交权贵，奢望从中捞得实惠，且专好听闻街谈巷语，以绯闻猛料当新闻，指望这些填补心灵的空虚。苏轼曾有诗云：人瘦尚可肥，士俗不可医。俗不可耐者，还剩几分德性可以示人？</p>
<p>东晋后期，陶渊明从政后，鄙视官场逢迎拍马，毅然辞官归隐。归隐后，他开始从事农业生产，并把田园生活的切身体会写成诗词，闲暇之余还和村里农民结下了深厚情谊。</p>
<p>陶渊明同农民的关系很好，但面对那些达官贵人之时却又是另一副样子。江州刺史王弘想结识陶渊明，可是陶渊明一概不予理睬。后来王弘想了一个办法，叫陶渊明的老熟人在半路上准备好酒食，等陶渊明经过时把他拦下来喝酒。陶渊明一见酒果然停下来。当他们两人喝得正有兴致的时候，王弘摇摇摆摆过来，假装是偶然碰到的，也来加入一起喝酒。这样总算认识了，也没惹起陶渊明的厌烦。几年后，名将檀道济做了江州刺史，亲自登门拜访陶渊明。当时陶渊明生着病，正躺在床上。檀道济对他说：“贤人安身立命的哲学应该是：世道坏就隐居，世道好就出去做官。现在你生活在光明的时代里，为什么非要隐居不可，自己和自己过不去呢？”陶渊明回说：“我怎么能跟贤人比呢？我的志向及不上他们。”婉转地拒绝了檀道济的劝说。檀道济临走时要送给他粮食和肉，也被他谢绝了。</p>
<p>陶渊明甘于贫贱、不慕荣华和隐居的决心令人敬佩，这也是文中“交市人，不如友山翁；谒朱门，不如亲白屋；听街谈巷语，不如闻牧唱樵歌；谈今人失德过差，不如述古人嘉言懿行”的精神所在。山翁虽粗鲁却有古道热肠，山歌虽简单却单纯自然，这些最淳朴的性情才能洗去市井的污浊之气。</p>
<p>人奉不必喜，人侮不须怒</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>我贵而人奉①之，奉此峨冠大带②也；我贱而人侮之，侮此布衣草履也。然则原非奉我，我胡为喜？原非侮我，我胡为怒？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①奉：奉承。</p>
<p>②峨冠大带：高冠大带，古代高官重臣的装饰。峨冠，高冠。大带，古代贵族礼服用带，有革带、大带之分。大带于革带之上，用料为素或练。《礼记•玉藻》：“大夫大带四寸。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>我显贵发达了别人奉承我，奉承的是我身上的高冠大带；我落魄贫困了别人侮辱我，侮辱的是我身上的布衣草鞋。如此看来别人本来就不是在奉承我，我为什么要高兴呢？本来就不是在侮辱我，我为什么要生气呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>我显贵发达了别人奉承我，奉承的是我手中握有的权力。我落魄贫困了别人看不起我，他们看不起的是贫困的生活。如此看来，别人奉承自己的时候不必得意，别人看不起自己的时候也不必自卑生气。</p>
<p>宋朝时王安石为相，吕惠卿与王安石意见相合，王安石举荐他为官。司马光写信给王安石说：“阿谀奉承的人，他们说的话听起来很顺耳，一旦失去权势，他们必然会卖主求荣。”后来王安石新法推行不顺，失去权势，吕惠卿故意把王安石私下信件透露给皇帝，使皇帝对王安石产生坏印象。吕惠卿这种做法就是当别人显贵的时候，就巴结奉承他，当别人有难的时候，就落井下石，跟着大家一起打击他。其实说到底他巴结奉承的不过是权势。看穿这一点，当别人恭维自己的时候也就不必过于高兴，当别人由于自己贫寒而轻视自己的时候也不必过于在意。</p>
<p>战国四公子之一的孟尝君，被罢免了相位以后，门下的食客纷纷离他而去。孟尝君感叹说自己一生好客，对待自己门下的食客从未有什么礼待不周的地方，现在他们看到我被罢免官职，就纷纷离我而去。如果让我再看到他们，必然唾其面羞辱他们。冯谖听后劝孟尝君说：“这也是一种自然现象，就好比早上纷纷上集市上的人，晚上又会匆匆忙忙地回去。这是因为早上他们在集市上能得到自己想要的东西。当晚上的时候，他们在集市上得不到自己所要的东西了。这并不是说他们对于集市本身有什么厌恶或者喜欢的感情。您失去相位了，自然客人们都离您而去。希望您能像从前那样待宾客。”孟尝君听从了冯谖的劝诫。</p>
<p>无事宜寂寂，有事宜惺惺</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>无事时心易昏昧①，宜寂寂而照以惺惺②；有事时心易奔驰，宜惺惺而主以寂寂③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①昏昧：愚昧不明事理。</p>
<p>②惺惺：聪明，机警。刘基《醒斋铭》：“昭昭生于惺惺，而愦愦出于冥冥。”</p>
<p>③寂寂：安静、沉静。《乐府杂录》：“广场寂寂，若无一人。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人在闲居无事时，心思最容易陷入昏沉迷乱的状态，这时应该在平静中保持自己的机警；人在有事忙碌时，感情最容易陷入急躁忙乱的冲动状态，这时应该在机警中保持冷静的头脑。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人在极无聊时，最容易产生懒散之心，致使人的意志消沉，于是就出现“小人闲居为不善”的情况，所以孔子才说“饱食终日无所用心难矣哉”，因此他主张“不有博奕者乎，为之犹贤乎已”，意思也就是说：“平日闲着没事时，下下棋活动活动脑筋，也比坐在那里发呆好”。</p>
<p>生活中，一个人若是太过闲散，容易消磨心性；工作中，要是太过清闲很容易产生挫败的失落感导致消极的工作情绪衍生。但是一个人要是太忙碌了，又容易冲动，处理事情时难免会欠妥当，因此，每个人都应该学会掌控自己的情绪，遇事多动动脑子。</p>

<p>②隙风：从门窗、墙壁的小孔吹进的风。</p>
<p>③损：伤害。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>那些喜好搬弄是非的人对德行君子的污蔑诽谤，就如同点点浮云遮住了太阳一般，只要风吹云散太阳自然重现光明；而那些喜好阿谀奉承去巴结别人的人，就如同门缝中吹进的邪风侵害肌肤，使人们在不知不觉中受到伤害。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>荀子《不苟》中说：刚刚洗过澡的人会抖一抖他的衣裳；刚刚洗过头的会弹一弹他的帽子。这是人之常情。谁愿意拿自己洁白的身体，去接受别人污黑的沾染呢？唐代有一个检校刑部郎中，名叫程皓，为人周慎，人情练达，从不谈人之短长。每当同辈之中有人非议别人，他都缄默不语。直到那人议论完后，他才慢慢地替被伤害的人辩解：“这都是众人妄传，其实不然。”甚至，还列举出这个人的某些长处。有时，他自己在大众广庭中被人辱骂，连在座的人都惊愕不已。程皓却不动声色，起身避开，说：“彼人醉耳，何可与言？”与其诅咒黑暗，不如点燃一支蜡烛。</p>
<p>人们受了谗言诽谤，或被人恶意攻击，心中有冤无处诉，感觉委曲，然而事实总是事实；如果不是实在的诬陷，这不过是短暂的黑暗，宛如乌云遮日，不久云散而重现光明；所以，人们如果被他人造了谣，最好不去理会，久而久之自会水落石出，谣言不攻而自破了。而造谣言的人如果再去挑拨离间，也就不再发生效果了。</p>
<p>人人喜欢被人赞扬，所有有些人专会以甜言蜜语哄人欢心，对人当面恭维，这种谄媚阿谀的风气，如果不改正过来，会犹如窗缝钻进来的寒风，在不知不觉中侵害人的肌体，久而久之人会得寒风侵袭的病症，使人受了健康的损害而不自觉。所以，甜言蜜语欺骗人的话，绝不可随便听信，以免损害品德。宁受人谤勿受人扬，受人诽谤则知所警惕，受人谄媚则败德丧身而不觉。</p>
<p>俗语有言“谣言止于智者”，惟有智者，才能透过阿谀奉承的厚厚云层，看清那轮清晰真实的太阳。</p>

<p>盈满勿再加，危急勿再搦</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>居盈①满者，如水之将溢未溢，切忌再加上一滴；处危急者，如木之将折未折，切忌再加一搦②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①盈：充满。《诗经•小雅•楚茨》：“我仓既盈。”</p>
<p>②搦（nuò）：压制。左思《魏都赋》：“搦秦起赵”。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当一个人的权力达到鼎盛的时候，就像已经装满水的水缸一样，这时千万不能再加入一滴否则就会立刻流出来；当一个人处在危险急迫的状况时，就像树木将要折断却还未折断的时候，千万不能再施加一点压力，否则就会有当即折断的危险。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子在鲁桓公的庙里参观，看见一种倾斜而不易放平的容器。孔子向守庙人询问道：“这是什么器具？”守庙人说：“这大概是人君放在座位右边的一种器具。”孔子说：“我听说这种器具，空着的时候就倾斜，灌进一半水就正立着，灌满了就翻倒了。”于是，孔子回头对跟随在身边的弟子说：“灌水吧！”弟子就舀水灌进容器里面，水灌到一半时，容器正好能立着，注满水反而就翻倒了，空着的时候是倾斜的。孔子喟然长叹：“唉！哪有满了不翻倒的呢？”子路问道：“要保持富贵的地位就如同要保持这个容器水满而不翻一样，有什么好的办法吗？”孔子说：“自己聪明智慧，就要保持愚昧的样子；功劳覆盖天下，要保持谦让的样子；既勇敢而力气盖世，要保持怯弱的样子；富可敌国，要保持谦逊的样子，这就是所谓谦让了再谦让的办法。”后来，子贡又问孔子说：“我想做到对人谦虚，但不知如何做才是最好？”孔子说：“对人谦虚吗？那就要像土地一样，深深地挖掘，就可以得到甘泉；种植，就可以五谷繁茂；草木繁殖了，禽鸟和野兽就在这里繁育，草木禽兽生长时就立在地上，死了就埋进土地中；土地的功劳很大，但它不自认为有德行。对人谦虚就该像土地一样。”</p>
<p>“满招损，谦受益”的谚语对大众来说，早已耳熟能详，意思是规劝世人凡事都要适可而止，因为人的欲望永远不会满足。所谓“人心不足蛇吞象”，永远不知满足也就永远生活在痛苦之中，所以只有知道满足的人才会得到人生乐趣。当一个人官高禄厚登峰造极的时候，就应当有所准备，万一有什么不幸或变故的话，也不至于一蹶而不振。所以，凡事应留余地。俗语也说：“身后有余忘缩手，眼前无路想回头。”人如果能够明白这其中的道理，自当好自为之，知机善退，才不会招致失败。</p>
<p>居官人难见，居乡人易见</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>士大夫居官，不可竿牍①无节，要使人难见，以杜幸端②；居乡，不可崖岸③太高，要使人易见，以敦④旧好。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①竿牍：书信。</p>
<p>②幸端：侥幸求进的门路。</p>
<p>③崖岸：山崖堤岸，比喻高傲，不可亲近。</p>
<p>④敦：敦厚。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>读书人做了官以后，对别人的求情求荐书信不可无节制地回复，要让那些求职的人难以见到自己，以便防范那些投机取巧奔走钻营的人；辞官归隐田园乡村之后，要放下自己的官架子，不能表现出令人难以接近的清高自傲，要态度平和使人容易接近相处，才能和乡间的亲邻旧友保持和睦的感情。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>刘邦称帝后，击破最后一个对手淮南王英布时，路过故乡沛邑，在那里呆了十多天。刘邦回故乡，可谓是荣归故里，八面威风，与故人、父老、子弟集拢一起喝酒聊天，话旧道故，又宣布沛邑作为自己的“汤沐邑”，世世代代免除他们的田赋，还从沛中选拔一百二十名青年合唱刘邦一时兴起做的诗：“大风起兮云飞扬，威加海内兮归故乡，安得猛士兮守四方！”刘邦边唱边舞，“慷慨伤怀，泣数行下”，着实流露出深厚的情谊，无穷的伤感。纵饮狂欢十多天后，父老乡亲们硬是舍不得让刘邦回关中，众人流泪挽留，刘邦感慨不已说：“吾人众多，父兄不能给。”最终，盛情难却，刘邦又“张饮三日”，然后率着大队人马，离开了故乡。</p>
<p>这里刘邦的情谊虽是帝王情，不过与“居官人难见，居乡人易见”的为官之道也是如出一辙。关于位居朝堂和退休乡野的应有态度，《论语•乡党》有这样的事例：“孔子于乡里，恂恂如也，似不能言者，其在宗室朝廷，便便言，唯谨尔，朝与下大夫言，侃侃如也，与上大夫方，訚訚如也。君在，踧踖如也，与与如也。”意思是说孔子在家乡父老面前，态度和蔼诚恳，好像不会说话的样子，可是在宗庙和朝廷之上，就能和各朝臣侃侃而谈，即使在君主面前也表现出相当的威信，这就是一种“居官有节度，乡居敦旧交”的具体表现。</p>
<p>中材多猜疑，事事难下手</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>至人①何思何虑，愚人不识不知，可与论学，亦可与建功。唯中才之人，多一番思虑智识，便多一番臆度②猜疑，事事难于下手。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①至人：指智慧与道德都尽善尽美的人。据《庄子•天下》篇“不离于真，谓之至人”。</p>
<p>②度：推测，揣摩。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>智慧与道德都完美无缺的人，对于任何事情都无忧无虑。愚鲁的人知道的不多，心中的想法也少。这两种人可以和他们讨论学习，也可以和他们一起建立功业。唯有那些才干中等的人，智慧不高不低，遇到事情考虑思谋得多，猜疑揣摩得也多，所以每件事情都难以下手做好。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>智慧超人、道德完美的人，在现实社会中为数不多。这些人做事情也必然能够做得十分完美，能够把事情处理得十分妥当。由于才思敏捷、智慧超群，处理事情时他们能够把各种情况在短时间内就考虑得非常周详，能够迅速作出判断取舍。不会表现出苦苦思索不知如何判断取舍的样子，也不会表现出下不了决定的样子。愚鲁的人，心机反而不多，遇到事情也不会左思右想。由于考虑得不多，往往纯朴单纯，想得少遇到事情便能很快作出决定。这两种人，人们可以和他们顺利合作。只有那些才干一般的人，既有才干，这才干又不是十分出众，这样的人遇到事情顾虑太多，不能迅速判断事情。猜疑多虑，左思右想却拿不定主意，与这样的人合作往往不能成事反而会延误时机。</p>
<p>唐太宗李世民没有继承王位时，被封为秦王。他东征西战，立下显赫战功。这些战功的取得，与他善于用人并且用人不疑有很大关系。李世民攻打洛阳王世充，尉迟敬德跟随李世民出征。不久军中有投降来的将士叛变，率众离开。因为尉迟敬德也是归降的，所以军中各大将军怕他也叛变逃跑，把他囚禁起来。还有人劝李世民把尉迟敬德杀掉。这些人说：尉迟敬德英武非凡，归降不久恐怕不是真心降服。现在把尉迟敬德关起来，他知道自己被猜疑，那么心中必然产生怨恨之情，如果一旦反叛起来，他武功高强，制服他很困难。不如马上把他杀掉，以绝后患。李世民不同意这些人看法，他认为尉迟敬德不会反叛。他命令人马上释放了尉迟敬德，并且把敬德请到内帐自己休息的地方，拿出一些珍宝送给尉迟敬德。李世明表示自己很相信尉迟敬德，微薄金宝送给尉迟敬德聊表与敬德共事的心意。尉迟敬德非常感动，谢过秦王走出帐外。不久李世明率领几百人马巡视战场，敬德跟随。来到洛阳城外北邙上处，王世充突然率领上万人马来堵截李世民。秦王被围困，正在危急时刻，尉迟敬德跃马而出，刺杀单雄信，救护李世民成功脱险。</p>
<p>伏久飞必高，开先谢必早</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>伏久者飞必高，开先者谢必早。知此，可以免蹭蹬①之忧，可以消躁急之念。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①蹭蹬：失势不得志的意思。木华《海赋》：“或乃蹭蹬穷波，陆死盐田。”（盐田：指海边）</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>蛰伏很久的鸟，一旦飞起来势必会飞得很高，开得越早的花木，盛开过后也必然凋谢得越快。人只要能明白这些道理，不仅可以免除失势不得志的忧虑，也可以消除急躁求成的念头。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《庄子•刻意》中说：“谈到隐没于世，时逢昏暗不必韬光便已自隐。古时候的所谓隐士，并不是为了隐伏身形而不愿显现于世，并不是为了缄默不言而不愿吐露真情，也不是为了深藏才智而不愿有所发挥，是因为时遇和命运乖妄、悖谬啊。当时遇和命运顺应自然而通行于天下，就会返归浑沌之境而不显露踪迹。当时遇不顺、命运乖违而穷困于天下，就固守根本，葆有宁寂至极之性而静心等待，这就是保存自身的方法。”</p>
<p>急功近利，实是追求事业成功者的一大忌。一急一躁间，极易忽略了历练内功，极易不顾时机未到，非要霸王硬上弓，椽子强出头。《史记•滑稽列传》中说：此鸟不飞则已，一飞冲天，不鸣则已，一鸣惊人。不过该鸟竟隐伏了三年之久，只为养精蓄锐，等待恰当时机。</p>
<p>孟子劝人应抱“穷则独善其身，达则兼济天下”的处世态度，所有心事都应容忍等待时机，绝对不可灰心丧志。宋江在《水浒传》中所吟《西江月》说：“自幼曾攻经史，成长亦有权谋，恰如猛虎卧荒丘，潜伏爪牙忍受。不幸刺文双颊，那堪配在江洲？他年若得报冤仇，血染浔阳江口！”另外一首《西江月》说：“心在山东身在吴，飘蓬江海漫嗟呼；他时若遂凌云志，敢笑黄巢不丈夫。”这两首词都说明了“见微知著，守正待时”的道理。</p>
<p>秦朝末年陈胜起兵于农家，反抗秦朝的暴政，虽然后来事败被杀，却留名千古，万世流芳。他在少年的时候和其他少年一同锄地，大家都笑他。他说了一句大话：“燕雀安知鸿鹄志。”后来果然起兵抗秦而成功。</p>
<p>以鸟来比人，所谓“伏久者飞必高”，以花来比人，所谓“开先者谢独早”。陈胜起兵最先亦是先行失败的一人，汉高祖刘邦起兵最迟、年龄亦大，可是成功最大，先灭秦而后灭楚，造就了汉朝四百年的基业。以人比物虽不尽恰当，但参之人事窥以天道，离道就不远了。是以成功的迟早，凋谢的先后，虽是人事的努力，其中却有天道的存在。又何必斤斤于蹭蹬之忧呢？</p>
<p>造物之钓饵，人世之机阱</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>非分之福，无故之获，非造物①之钓饵，即人世之机阱②。此处着眼不高，鲜不堕彼术中③矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①造物：大自然。语出《庄子•大宗师》篇：“伟大造物者”。</p>
<p>②机阱：机关陷阱，这里用来比喻害人的圈套。阱：为防御或捕捉野兽或敌人而挖的坑。《汉书.谷永传》：“又以掖庭狱大为乱阱。”</p>
<p>③术中：计略之中。史记苏秦张仪列传：“此吾在术中而不悟，吾不及苏君明矣。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不是自己分内所应享受的福气，无缘无故得到的意外收获，即使它们不是上天故意用来诱惑你的诱饵，也必然是别人用来诈骗故意设下的机关陷阱。为人处世如果不在这些地方睁大眼睛，就很难能逃得过歹徒精心设下的圈套。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孟子说：“虽曰爱之其实害之，虽曰忧之其实仇之。”这是说明了祸福循环相连的道理。因此，人无功受禄寝食不安，就是怕得非分之福，受了造化弄人之祸。所以“非分之福，无故所获”，我们应该极力躲避不要使它降临到自己的身上。</p>
<p>一般人不明此理，偏偏要去寻找意外的收获与利欲，结果弄得身败名裂，历史上像这样亡国破家的人实在不少。凡事若能从远处看，能事先了解当中的利害关系，自然就会免于深陷其中。</p>
<p>韩、魏两国边境相邻，为争边界的土地起了争端，魏强韩弱，抗争之下，韩国自然免不了要吃亏，韩国国君昭僖侯为此很是发愁。韩国贤人华子拜见昭僖侯，劝昭僖侯不要与魏国拼争。华子对昭僖侯说：“如果现在有人和您订下誓约，这誓约规定，拿到誓约者可以得天下。但是，如果他用右手去拿，便砍掉他的右手，用左手去拿，便砍掉他的左手，你是不是仍然要去拿它呢？”昭僖侯说：“咳，那我当然是不要那誓约的。”华子接着说：“这就是了，保全自己比拥有天下更重要。韩国自然比不了天下，韩国边界之地自然也比不上韩国的整个封地，你又何必去为争那一点而伤及自身呢？”由此看来，其实避祸就是求安；避祸之法就是保平安之法。不见利忘害，便可求安；不为名伤身，便有福至；不做非分之想，便无无妄之灾；不逞能斗狠，便无祸来。无病无忧，一箪一瓢，自足福气。</p>
<p>人常说，憨人有憨福，并不是说憨人能以机巧求利得福，而是说他无意求福反自保平安而得福。常言道“人为财死，鸟为食亡”、“人见利而不见害，鱼见食而不见钩”、“天欲祸之，必先福之”，这些都说明了“非分之收获，陷溺之根源”。诈骗者正是利用人们贪图非分之财的弱点，这跟鸟鱼贪图食物而上钩完全相同。其实防范诈骗者的方法很简单，只要抱定“非分之财不取”的原则，歹徒的诱饵再香甜再美丽也起不了作用，因为“凡事之不近人情者，鲜不为大奸慝”。</p>
<p>一事起害生，以无事为福</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>一事起则一害生，故天下常以无事为福。读前人①诗云：“劝君莫话封侯事，一将功成万骨枯。”又云：“天下常令万事平，匣中②不惜千年死。”虽有雄心猛气，不觉化为冰霰③矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①前人：指唐代诗人曹松，舒州人，字梦征。年七十余中进士。</p>
<p>②匣中：藏在匣中的意思。</p>
<p>③冰霰：下雪前或下雪时降落的白色小冰粒。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>有一件事兴起就会有一个祸害产生，所以天下常常以没有事情为福。读前人曹松的诗说：“我奉劝诸君还是不要谈论封侯的事情了，因为一员大将的战功是由无数人的尸骨堆成的。”古人还说：“使天下永远太平无事，把各种兵器都收藏起来。”读完这些诗句，虽然有雄心壮志，也在不知不觉中都化成冰雪了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>老子说：“祸兮福所之伏。福兮祸之所依。”天下事利害得失常是连在一起的。俗语说：“有一利必有一害，有一得必有一失。”这是世间的一定道理。所以说：“天下常以无事为福。”又说：“多一事不如少一事。”所以天下还是以少事为福。天下大乱，最终受益的只是少数人。帝王将相成就了自己的功业，却使得天下众生遭难，民不聊生。乱世中，帝王将相的功业是由无数人的白骨堆成的。</p>
<p>宋代丞相李沆曾经说：“当今国家的设施制度已经非常详细完备，假如轻率地将各种建议都加以实行，损害就大了。有时候提建议的人，只是图一时的进取，没有替老百姓考虑。”</p>
<p>明朝丞相高拱说：“官员中有一些人专门欺瞒朝廷，地方上有事情时，隐瞒起来不往上报，或者是本来没有事情，他们却生事邀功。还有一些人把小事变成大事，或者是无中生有，总之是为了显示自己的本领。甚至还有一些把小事情激化成大乱子，以便证实自己从前所说的谎言。”</p>
<p>古人说：“太平本是将军致，不许将军看太平。”真是说尽了天机，话尽了人事。将军立功在战场，从战场上得功名。到了太平的时候，将军就英雄无用武之地了。这就说明了天下的利害得失都是循环相接的，有了昔日的盛，才有今日之衰，明白这种循环天理的法则，心中藏着雄心勇气，不觉冰散化为乌有了。</p>
<p>爵不笼无欲，鼎不加远引</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>龙可豢①，非真龙；虎可搏，非真虎。故爵禄可饵②荣进之辈③，必不可笼④淡然无欲之人；鼎镬⑤可及宠利之流⑥，必不可加飘然远引之士⑦。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①豢（huàn）：喂养。</p>
<p>②饵：诱惑。</p>
<p>③荣进之辈：追求荣华富贵的人。</p>
<p>④笼：装入笼中，比喻用荣华富贵笼络束缚人。</p>
<p>⑤鼎镬（huò）：两种烹调的器物，鼎有足，镬无足。古代酷刑，用鼎镬烹煮人。</p>
<p>⑥宠利之流：追求恩宠利禄的人。</p>
<p>⑦飘然远引之士：超脱世俗，不追求名利的人。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>龙如果可以喂养，那就不是真正的龙；虎如果可以被人轻易捕获，那就不是真正的虎。所以名利可以引诱贪图名利的人，必然不能笼络淡然无欲、不追求名利的人；鼎镬之祸可以落到那些追求恩宠利禄的人身上，必然不能加害那些超脱俗世、不追求名利的人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有雄才大略，志向高远的人，建功立业是为了实现自己安邦治国、造福天下的人生理想。他们并不贪图荣华富贵，也不并贪恋恩宠利禄。古代很多人将个人遭遇的变化原因看得玄妙莫测，认为一切皆是命定，其实不然。这里解释了个人命运遭遇变化的真正原因，不是那个让人看不见摸不着的“天”，而是实实在在的自己。可以用来豢养的龙，实际上不是真正的龙；人可以徒手与之较量的老虎，实际上不是真正的老虎。这个道理延伸开去，功名利禄可以用来诱惑那些想要进身取得荣耀的人们，但对于那些无欲无求把什么都看得很淡的人肯定无效。那些曾经得到过上司极度恩宠的人也许有一天会遭受极刑，可是极刑绝对不会用到那些远离尘世远离名望利欲的人身上。</p>

<p>争高得还失，忙过寿亦夭</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>一场闲富贵，狠狠争来，虽得还是失；百岁好光阴，忙忙过了，纵寿亦夭①。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①夭：夭折，未成年的人死去。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一场对于人生而言并不重要的富贵，费尽心思争夺来，虽然得到了富贵却失去了人最珍贵的品质；人生百年的好时光，在匆匆忙忙中度过，即使是长寿其实也是短命。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>如果富贵是费尽心机拼命挣来的，那么虽然得到了想要的财富，失去的却更多，实际上是得不偿失。能活过百岁高龄，那该有多美好啊，可如果是为名为利匆匆忙忙过去的，即便是长寿也跟短命没有什么两样。人们如果欲望太多、太强烈，太多的压力就会接踵而至，生活中就会有种种苦涩的味道。</p>
<p>东汉马援，从事畜牧业时，养了几千头牛羊，还蓄养了不少好马，家中藏有几万斛的粮食。他把财物分给亲戚朋友，并且说：“有了财富就应该散去，不然的话人就会变成守财奴。”</p>
<p>人生苦短，人们在为名利奔走的同时，需要给自己留下一些时间，体悟人生，享受生活。富贵虽然好，也要看富贵是怎么得来的。如果是通过正当的方式获得富贵，享受富贵时才能心无愧疚。在为自己谋求富贵的同时，也为别人留有余地。如果拼死拼活、不计手段抢夺富贵，即使能把富贵抢到手，却也把人最宝贵的品性丢失了。</p>
<p>生活应当从容淡定，不要为追求而追求，不要被目标逼到不得喘息的地步。操之过急，急功近利，欲速则不达；从容淡定则是在搭建更易于接近目标的阶梯，让人缓步上升，实现理想。</p>
<p>高车嫌地僻，驷马喜门高</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>高车①嫌地僻，不如鱼鸟解亲人；驷马②喜门高，怎似莺花能避俗。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①高车：车盖高大的车，指高官显贵所乘的车，此代指高官。</p>
<p>②驷马：四匹马拉的车，也为高官显贵所乘的车，此代指显贵。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>高官总是嫌平常人家地方偏僻，车马难至，不如饲养的鱼鸟能理解人性、与人相亲；显贵喜欢攀附高贵的门庭，怎比得上黄莺和鲜花能超脱俗气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>宋高宗绍兴年间，苏云卿由广汉迁来豫章东湖，结庐独居。作为一个外来户，苏云卿凭着自己的为人品德和谦逊礼貌，很快就赢得了当地老百姓的敬爱。人们亲切地称之曰“苏翁”。</p>
<p>苏云卿相貌俊美，衣着简朴，穿衣打扮，一副农家模样，是位修养极深，长于养生的得道者。</p>
<p>苏云卿乐于园艺，成年累月置身于园圃，潜心于种植浇灌，并琢磨出了其中的规律，使四季的蔬菜品种不绝，蔬菜的味道鲜美之极，其他园圃相形见绌。苏云卿的技艺受到人们的欢迎，获得相当好的收益，他种的蔬菜价格也就与众不同，价钱高，人们也喜爱买，菜一上市就被一抢而光。</p>
<p>苏云卿把自己的全部才学、智慧、精神都用在了种菜上，并乐此不疲，自由逍遥地生活着。乡民们只知苏云卿是位高人，但并摸不清这位外来人的底细。真正了解他的是其同乡，自幼在一起长大的张浚。</p>
<p>张浚在仕途上一帆风顺，成了一朝丞相，他没有忘记自己的好友，也不想埋没朋友的才华，决心举荐苏云卿入朝为官，协助自己治理天下。遂派人带上书信、金币去相请。被派的人去到苏云卿家，告知来意，并留下书信及金币，约好第二天来接他去面见丞相。谁知，第二天，天一亮，车早早停在苏翁门外等候着，直到日上竿头，仍不见动静。当官吏破门而入，见到的却是：丞相的书信，原封未动，装金币的盒子，封条未启，室内洁净，家具依旧，丝毫看不出一丝慌乱的迹象。房中的主人，却已不知去向。</p>
<p>苏云卿的内心世界是一个自尊自主的世界，不需要权势，不需要恩赐，只需要无人干涉，独自自由自在地生活。他逃避的是权势的奴役，富贵的奴役，名利的引诱。现实生活中，如果我们能够突破名利观念，自然就能做到富贵不淫、贫贱不移、威武不屈，自然懂得当功名、富贵、财货到来时，应该思考一下是否该得，在忧患、灾难、生死的关键时刻，必须考虑是否应该离开。不该得的时候，就是一丝也不能取；不该离开的时候，就是饿着肚子、面对绝望也不能离开。这是一种风范，更是一种气节。</p>
<p>勿趋炎附势，甘栖适守逸</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>趋炎附势①之祸，甚惨亦甚速；栖②恬守逸之味，最淡亦最长。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①趋炎附势：依附权贵。</p>
<p>②栖：寄托，停留。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>依附于权贵所惹来的祸害，非常迅速也非常悲惨；甘于恬淡闲适的生活，虽然平淡却最为长久。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>权门显贵得势的时候，虽然显赫荣耀，一旦失去权势的时候景况会十分凄凉。趋炎附势，攀附权贵，能得到一时的荣耀，却有可能惹来杀身之祸，实在是得不偿失。甘于淡泊，虽然平淡无奇，却能平安久远。</p>
<p>明朝时候，严嵩父子深得皇帝宠信，气焰嚣张，趋附在他门下的人有很多。有一天严嵩过生日，宜春县令刘巨塘到京城拜见皇上，随着大家一同前往严嵩府中为他拜寿。寿礼结束之后，严嵩感觉疲乏，于是他的儿子严世蕃就命人把大门关上，禁止大家出入。刘巨塘没来得及出门，被关在了严嵩府中。到了中午，刘巨塘感觉饥饿难耐，想找点食物却不好动手。这个时候有一个叫严辛的人，他说自己是严纪钢的仆人。严辛带着刘巨塘从一条小路来到他自己住的地方，并且准备了饭菜请刘巨塘吃。饭后，严辛说希望您以后能多多关照我。</p>
<p>刘巨塘觉得奇怪，说你的主人正是如日当中显赫昌盛的时候，怎么还用得上我呢，我又能帮你什么忙呢？严辛回答说太阳不可能总是在当午，希望您以后不要忘记我的请求啊。过了几年之后，严嵩失势，刘巨塘在袁州当政，严辛因为窝赃被关押在监狱中。刘巨塘想起当年一饭之恩，为他减轻了罪行，判他发配边疆。严嵩的仆人严辛能够认识到依附权势并不可靠，提前为自己留下后路，所以后来能获得减刑。趋炎附势虽然能获得一时的荣耀，当自己所依附的权势失去势力的时候，跟随而来的祸事是非常惨烈的。甘于淡泊，虽然滋味平淡，却能享有长久安稳自由自在的生活。所以为一时的荣耀，而失去平安自由的生活，实在是得不偿失的事情，真正明智的人是不会这样做的。</p>
<p>林中无荣辱，义路泯炎凉</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>隐逸林中无荣辱，道义路上泯①炎凉②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①泯：消失，消除。</p>
<p>②炎凉：比喻人情冷暖。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个退隐林泉之中与世隔绝的人，对于红尘俗世的一切是是非非完全都忘怀；一个讲求仁义道德而心存济世救民的人，对于世俗的贫贱富贵都看得淡时无厚此薄彼之分。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>看透世间是非，没有荣与辱的感官，这是道家倡导的出世精神，也是儒家“人我两忘，恩怨皆空”的入世提倡。然而，出世还是入世，一直影响着中国古代士子们对生命形态的选择。</p>
<p>哀公问孔子说：“请问，什么样的人是贤人？”孔子回答：“所谓贤人，行为合乎礼仪法规但对自身不会伤害，言语足以为天下人效法但对自身不会伤害，富足得拥有天下但不积蓄私财，对天下普遍进行施舍但不担心自己贫困，如果这样，就可以称之为贤人了。”贤人是有足够智慧和力量的人，一个以天下为己任的人。有足够的智慧和力量，他才强大，以天下为己任，他才无己无私。他的言行自自然然，没有丝毫做作和媚俗，他并不执意追求成功却能获得成功，他并不格外回避灾难却能逢凶化吉，他并不特别祈求幸福但总能轻松愉快，他把自己纳入一定的规矩和方圆中但不感到痛苦和冲突，他博大地爱，但不感到孤独，他广泛地施舍，但不感到贫穷，他是自由和自在的人。因此，天下人总是把他作为楷模。</p>
<p>一个退隐林泉之中与世隔绝的人，对于红尘俗世的一切是是非非完全都忘怀；一个讲求仁义道德而心存济世救民的人，对于世俗的贫贱富贵都看得淡而无厚此薄彼之分。所以，追求真正的解脱，出世放下恩怨，入世便不计荣辱，这样也就无所谓世态炎凉了。</p>
<p>意气期天下，肝胆照天下</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>意气与天下相期①，如春风之鼓畅庶类②，不宜存半点隔阂之形；肝胆与天下相照，似秋月之洞彻③群品④，不可作一毫暧昧之状。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①相期：相契合，相投合。</p>
<p>②庶类：众多的物类。</p>
<p>③洞彻：照亮，照遍。</p>
<p>④群品：意思同“庶类”。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>意气与天下大众的意气相契合，就像春风激发万物，不应该保留半点隔绝不通的痕迹；肝胆与天下大众的肝胆相照应，就如秋月照亮众物，不可表现出一丝一毫模糊不清的状况。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>单纯而率真的古代文人们，在那些物质贫瘠的时代中放逐着灵魂的自由。他们有“达则兼济天下，穷则独善其身”的朴素理想，有“念天地之悠悠，独怆然而涕下”的无奈；有“仰天大笑出门去，我辈岂是蓬蒿人”的豪言壮语，有“行到山穷处，坐看云起时”的从容，孔子困陈蔡而作《春秋》；屈原被放逐而作《离骚》；司马迁忍辱作《史记》……在创造出大量文学瑰宝的同时，更令人关注的是他们自身的人格魅力，是这些坚强、正直的心灵赋予了那些文字不朽的生命，那背后是中华民族引以为傲的不屈的精神。这种精神超越了物质本身得到升华，让人们坚信物质创造的魅力只是一瞬，而灵魂可以永恒。</p>
<p>忙碌而务实的现代人们，生活在一个物质比任何时代都富足，精神比任何时代都空虚的时代，将创造美好物质生活作为毕生目标的人比比皆是。听凭精神之花在心底慢慢老去、枯萎、死亡。人们的价值取向在发生变化，精神在尚未和物质取得平衡时即被同化，这不能不说是一个时代的悲哀。米兰•昆德拉说：“愚昧并不为科学、技术性、进步等等让路，相反它正随着进步一起成长；我们面临的不是无知，而是麻木无感觉。那些纯理论性的观念被大众媒体增值，从而造成的巨大力量，将碾碎一切感性进而取消人类文明的特质。”</p>
<p>想到那些执著的为了精神上的理想而活的人们，觉得他们才是幸福的。精神的支撑可以让物资建造的殿堂熠熠生辉；物质条件的优越又可使精神家园百花常开。只是人们常错误以为用物质可建造一座精神天堂。所以，不妨停下脚步，心平气和地听一听历史长廊中的回声。</p>
<p>济饥饿之人，胜结纳贤豪</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>费千金而结纳贤豪，孰若倾半瓢之粟，以济饥饿之人；构千楹①而招来宾客，孰若葺数椽之茅②，以庇孤寒之士。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①构千楹：造千间房屋。楹：一间房为一楹。</p>
<p>②葺数椽之茅：修几间茅房。葺，用茅草覆盖房屋，泛指修理房屋；椽，本指房屋的椽子，这里借指房屋的间数。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>花费千斤之资去结交招纳圣贤豪杰，不如拿出半瓢之粟去救济饥饿之人；建造千间房屋去招徕贵宾门客，不如修几间简陋的茅屋去庇护孤苦无靠的寒士。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《左传》记载：晋国赵宣子，在首阳山打猎，见桑树荫下，有一个饿汉，知道这人已经三天没有进食，宣子就下马取出食物给他吃。饿汉吃到一半，停下不吃，宣子问他原因，他说：“我想拿回去给老母亲吃。”宣子叫他吃完，另外给他一些肉食，让他带回去。后来，晋灵公埋伏士兵想要杀害宣子。在宣子突遭袭击，万分危急之时，一位勇士救了他。宣子脱险之后，问勇士：“你为什么要救我？”勇士说：“我就是桑树下的饿汉。”</p>
<p>文中“费千金而结纳贤豪，孰若倾半瓢之粟，以济饥饿之人”正是此理。对人不必锦上添花，应当雪中送炭。天天吃山珍海味的人，你送给他一碗小白菜，他心里会想：我家肉多得天天喂狗，送我白菜干什么？但是，如果是一个三日没有进食的乞丐，送他一碗白饭，他都会终生难忘这一饭之恩，因为你是在他生命攸关时救了他的命。所以，帮助人应在别人所需之处帮助，如果能做到急他人所急，供他人所需，才是恰当之举。</p>
<p>先达笑弹冠，相知犹按剑</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>先达①笑弹冠②，休向侯门③轻曳裾④；相知犹按剑，莫从世路暗投珠。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①先达：得官显贵在前的人。</p>
<p>②弹冠：用手指弹去冠上的灰尘，比喻将出来做官。</p>
<p>③侯门：权贵之门。</p>
<p>④曳裾：拖着大襟。古代常用以形容奔走于权贵门下的样子。曳，拖；裾，外衣的大襟。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>已经显贵做了高官的人，总是要嘲笑那些借助自己的势力取得官职的人，所以不要经常奔走于权贵之门。朋友之间还会拔剑相争，所以在与人交往时不要明珠暗投，轻易地信任别人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人与人之间的交情，不是在一起吃喝，一起玩乐，一起郊游，一起戏闹，真情是要在相互肯定、相互体谅、相互了解、相互包容中培养的。能在相互肯定、相互体谅、相互了解、相互包容中相处的人，夫妻必定会相亲相爱，亲朋必定会相互感谢，主从必能彼此扶持。因为有相互肯定、相互体谅、相互了解、相互包容，人间才能有情有义，若失去了这些，不只知交的朋友背地里会暗伏一把杀人剑，就是父母子女都有可能反目成仇。</p>
<p>春山游骑图</p>
<p>业不必求满，功不必求盈</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>事事要留个有余不尽的意思，便造物①不能忌我，鬼神不能损我。若业必求满，功必求盈者，不生内变，必招外忧②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①造物：创造天地万物，也可指创造万物的神。《庄子•大宗师》：“伟哉！夫造物者将以予为此拘拘者。”</p>
<p>②外忧：外来的攻讦、忌恨、外患。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不论做任何事都要留有余地，不要把事情做得太绝，这样即使是创造万物的神也不会嫉妒，也不会遭到神鬼的伤害。假如对一切事物都要求做到尽善尽美的地步，一切功劳都希望能达到登峰造极的境界，即使不为此而发生内乱，也必然会为这些招致外来的攻诘、忌恨。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>“日盈时昃，月盈则食”。儒家从周而复始的自然变化中得到心灵的启示：“无来不陂，无往不复。”世事如浮云，循环往复，瞬息万变。人生变故，也如水流，事盛则衰，物极必反。生活既然如此，为人处世就应处处讲究恰当的分寸。过犹不及，不及是大错，太过是大恶，恰到好处的是不偏不倚的中和。</p>
<p>俗话说：“做人不要做绝，话不能说满。”廉颇因为做人太绝，不得不负荆登门向蔺相如赔罪。郑伯因为话说得太尽，无奈何掘地及泉，遂而见母。凡事若能留有一丝余地，才好避免走向极端。</p>
<p>《左传》中记载：晋、楚有一次交战于鄢陵。晋国的范文子认为这场仗不应该打，便对晋厉公说：“只有圣人能达到内外无忧。既不是圣人，没有外患必有内忧。不如放过楚国，就当做是长期外患吧！”晋厉公不听，偏要发动这次战争。后来这场仗打赢了，回国后晋厉公越发骄傲、奢侈，宠信奸佞，甚至宠幸到任由晋大夫胥童杀死了贤臣三卻，即卻犨、卻锜、卻至。后来，晋厉公终被晋大夫匠丽所杀。</p>
<p>不为君相笼，不受造化铸</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>彼富我仁①，彼爵我义，君子故不为君相所牢笼②；人定胜天③，志一动气④，君子亦不受造化⑤之陶铸⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①彼富我仁：出自《孟子》一书：“晋、楚之富不可及也。彼以其富，我以吾仁；彼以其爵，我以吾义，吾何谦乎哉？”</p>
<p>②牢笼：牢的本义是指养牛马的地方，此含有限制、束缚等意。据《淮南子•本经》篇：“牢笼天地，弹压山川。”</p>
<p>③人定胜天：指人如果能艰苦奋斗，必然能战胜命运而成功。</p>
<p>④志一动气：志是一个人心中对人生的一种理想愿望；一是专一或集中；动是统御、控制发动；气是指情绪、气质、秉赋。《孟子•公孙丑》上：“志一则动气，气一则动志。”</p>
<p>⑤造化：命运。</p>
<p>⑥陶铸：陶是范土制器，铸是熔金为器。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>别人有财富我坚守仁德，别人有爵禄我坚守正义，所以一个有高风亮节的君子绝对不会被君主的高官厚禄所束缚或收买。人的智慧能战胜大自然，理想意志可以转变自己的感情气质，所以一个有才德理智的君子绝对不受命运的摆布。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孟子说：“晋、楚之富不可及也。彼以其富，我以吾仁；彼以其爵，我以吾义，吾何谦乎哉？”又说：“志一则动气，气一则动志。”</p>
<p>西汉严遵，字君平，临邛（今四川邛崃）人。他曾经在成都以占卜为生，每天的收入，以足够生活的一百文钱为限，赚够就收摊关门，在家中专心研究《周易》，成为很有学问的大师。大文学家杨雄就曾以他为师。杨雄异常钦仰自己的老师，认为老师的清贫风范足以抨击贪婪，勉励良好的风气，称赞老师是“当世少有的具有高尚节操的人”。有富人罗冲预备出钱，资助他去做官扬名，严遵感叹地表示：“益我货者损我神，生我名者杀我身。”始终不愿意为财富、名利，而丧失自己的志趣。</p>
<p>一个活得洒脱的人，不应为身外之物所牵累，不受富贵名利的诱惑，我行我素，也正如庄子在《则阳篇》中描述的圣人那样：“圣人，他们潜身世外能使家人忘却生活的清苦，他们身世显赫能使王公贵族忘却爵禄而变得谦卑起来。对于外物，他们与之各谐欢娱；对于别人，他们乐于沟通，混迹人世而又能保持自己的真性；有时候一句不说也能用中和之道给人以满足，跟人在一块儿就能使人受到感化。父亲和儿子都各得其宜，各自安于自己的地位，而圣人完全是清虚无为地对待周围所有的人。圣人的想法跟一般人的心思，相比起来差距很远。”</p>
<p>修行木石念，经邦云水趣</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>进德修道①，要个木石②的念头，若一有欣羡，便趋欲境；济世经邦，要段云水③的趣味，若一有贪著④，便堕危机。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①修道：泛指修炼佛道两派心法。佛家语中说：“谓见道之后，更修习真观。”</p>
<p>②木石：木柴和石块都是无欲望无感情的物体，喻无情欲。《孟子•尽心篇》中说：“与木石居，与鹿豕游。”</p>
<p>③云水：佛家称行脚僧为云水，这种和尚手持三宝云游天下，四海为家毫无牵挂，行迹飘忽有如行云流水。他们不受物欲束缚而具淡泊雅趣。</p>
<p>④贪著：对富贵等欲念的执著。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>凡是磨炼心志修身养性的人，需要一种像木石一样坚定不移的意志，若是生了羡慕花花世界的念头，便会步入贪欲的境地；凡是治理国家拯救世间的人，须拥有一种如行云流水般的淡泊胸襟，如果有了贪恋荣华富贵的念头，就会陷入危机四伏的险恶深渊。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>凡是磨练心性提高道德修养的人，必须有木石一样坚定的意志，假如羡慕外界的荣华富贵，那就会被物欲所困惑包围。凡是一个治理国家服务社会的人，必须有一种宛如行云流水般的淡泊胸怀，假如贪恋功名利禄，就会陷入危机四伏的险地。当尧之时，天下还很不安宁，大水成灾，洪荒四溢，草木生长茂盛谷物却没有收成。而且鸟兽成群地繁殖，到处都有它们的足迹，它们糟蹋庄稼，危及人类。尧很为此忧心，于是选拔舜总领治理工作。舜任用伯益掌管火政，任用大禹掌管水政，伯益放火烧荒，驱走鸟兽，大禹疏浚九河，引流入海，终于使天下安定太平。不用说，按劳心与劳力的区分，尧、舜自然是劳心者，伯益、大禹自然该算劳力者。据说大禹治水，三过家门而不入，其紧张劳累是可以想见的。但当时以尧、舜的劳心和伯益、大禹的劳力，终于使乌兽逃遁，禾稼有收，使江河畅流，水患不兴，这劳心与劳力之间的孰主孰次，孰重孰轻，实在是很难区分的。</p>
<p>伯益、大禹是劳心者，百姓民众自然又是劳力者，伯益、大禹以他们的才智制定治兽治水方略，百姓民众以他们的拼力劳作使这方略得以实施，伯益、大禹由此而获得政绩，百姓民众也因此而能安居乐业。</p>
<p>志以淡泊明，节从肥甘丧</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>藜口苋肠①者，多冰清玉洁②；衮衣玉食③者，甘婢膝奴颜④。盖志以淡泊明，而节从肥甘⑤丧矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①藜口茁肠：藜，藜科一年生草木植物，嫩苗可蒸煮吃。苋，属英科一年生草生植物，茎叶可食。据《昭明文选》曹植《北启》说：“余甘黎藿未暇此食也。良注：‘藜藿贱菜，布衣所食。’”应指平民百姓。</p>
<p>②冰清玉洁：形容人的品德像冰一样清明透澈像玉一样，纯洁无瑕，据《新论•妄瑕》说：“伯夷叔齐，冰清玉洁。”</p>
<p>③衮衣玉食：指权贵。衮衣是古代帝王所穿的龙服，此处比喻华服。</p>
<p>④婢膝奴颜：也作奴颜婢膝，比喻自甘堕落而没骨气的人。</p>
<p>⑤肥甘：美味，比喻物质享受。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>能吃粗茶淡饭生活的人，他们的操守多半像冰玉般纯洁；而讲求华美饮食奢侈的人，多半甘愿做出卑躬屈膝的奴才面孔。因为一个人的志向要在清心寡欲的状态下才能表现出来，而一个人的节操都从贪图物质享受中丧失殆尽。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>结合现实社会上那些贪赃枉法以权谋私腐化堕落的人，他们的犯罪动机大多是为了满足物质需求，追求浮华而致。贪图物质享受的人，生活容易陷于糜烂，精神生活空虚，也难有高尚的品德，因此他们为了能得到更高一层的享受，不惜用任何手段去钻营，甚至于卑躬屈膝，最终人格丧失殆尽。人人都有追求较好物质生活的权利，较好的物质生活是追求较高精神需求的基础，但“君子爱财取之有道”，只有通过劳动致富才是光荣的。从另一个角度来讲，只讲物欲要求的生活是不完全的，没有充实精神生活的物欲是空虚的。</p>
<p>雷锋曾说过：生活上向低标准看齐，工作上向高标准看齐。这说明人要有理想，有追求；不能以贪图享受，满足物欲作为最大需求，不能玩物丧志，成为社会的寄生虫。</p>
<p>居里夫人在读书时生活极为贫困。后来，因为她刻苦学习，成绩优异，波兰的“亚历山大基金会”颁发给她600卢布奖学金，以资助她在法国继续深造。四年后，居里夫人在研究钢铁的磁化技术方面获得了成功，法国科学协会发给她一笔酬金。尽管她当时生活仍很贫困，但她除了用这笔钱购置了一些实验仪器外，把余下的金额全部寄给了“亚历山大基金会”。她在附信中说：“我把你们的奖学金当做光荣的借款，它帮助我获得初步荣誉。借款理应归还，请把它发给另一个生活贫寒，而又立志争取更大荣誉的波兰青年。”</p>
<p>能察能不察，能胜能不胜</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>好察①非明，能察能不察之谓明②；必胜非勇，能胜能不胜之谓勇。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①察：调查研究。</p>
<p>②明：明白，明智。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>每件事情都详细调查得清楚明白，这并不是真正的明白。该详细调查的就详细调查，不该详细调查的就不详细调查，这才是真正的明白通达。每次打仗都一定要取得胜利，这不是真正的勇敢。既能取得胜利，也能在必要的时候不取胜，这才是真正的勇敢。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>汉朝时有人说：“选拔士人一定要求清白谨慎。”这不过是妇人村夫的愚见。世事复杂，爱惜自己的人，是很难去跟别人论说自己背后的难言之隐的。</p>
<p>《易卦》说：有时君子要能容忍小人，甚至要曲意奉承，才能灾尽吉来。有志胸怀天下的志士，怎可为保一生的清誉，而置国家大计于不顾呢？</p>
<p>陈平接受贿赂，多送他金银的，他就派给这个人好差使，送他金银少的，他就派给这个人坏差使。有人向刘邦告状，把陈平从前偷嫂嫂钱的事也说了出来。刘邦责备引荐陈平的魏无知，魏无知说陈平能干，在用人之际不可以斤斤计较。陈平自我辩解说他很穷，接收金银是为了撑管场面。最终刘邦还是留下了陈平。后来陈平为刘邦献了不少良策。</p>
<p>明朝正德年间，阉臣刘瑾专权凶暴，贤臣刘健、谢迁与李东阳同心辅政，天下称贤相。武宗时请诛刘瑾，不为武宗接纳，于是众人都纷纷辞官归隐，只有李东阳（字宾之，孝宗时受皇命辅武宗，卒谥文正）不但仍尽心在朝辅政，并且言行更加谨慎，时时居间调解各朝臣间的冲突，许多乡绅豪族也都赖李东阳暗中庇护才保全性命。现在世人都责备李东阳不能为保节而辞官，却不曾想到当年孝宗崩逝前，刘健、谢迁、李东阳三人在孝宗病榻前，接受先皇亲口托付的幼主，假使李东阳也和刘、谢二人一样辞官归隐，那么国事将败坏到更不可收拾的地步，这岂不是辜负孝宗的重托吗？由此看来，李东阳不辞官，实在有他万不得已的苦衷。</p>
<p>直至晚年，李东阳与友人谈及此事，还常痛哭不止，为别人不能体谅自己的苦心而痛苦。</p>
<p>入世悉世外，出世先谙世</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>思入世①而有为者，须先领得世外②风光，否则无以脱垢浊之尘缘③；思出世而无染者，先谙尽世中滋味，否则无以持空寂之苦趣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①入世：涉足人世，参与世事。</p>
<p>②世外：俗世之外。</p>
<p>③尘缘：佛家语。佛家谓世间的色、声、香、味、触、法为六尘，是污染人心、产生欲念的根源，故称尘缘。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>想要参与世事并有所作为的人，必须先领会世俗之外的意趣，否则就不能脱去世俗之中污染人心、产生欲念的根源；想要超脱世俗、一尘不染的人，先应该尝遍世俗之中的趣味，否则就不能保持超脱世俗后空虚寂寞、以苦为乐的旨趣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生一世，如草生一秋，是匆匆忙忙的短暂。所有的人，上自帝王显贵，下至黎民苍生，都是这匆匆舞台的演员和看客。常言浮生若梦，过去把这话是当做消极的思想来批判的，其实，谁都明白，人生到底是一出悲剧。无论是天才还是愚钝，到头来都摆脱不了一个毫无二致的结局。有了这样的洞察，人们就会在不免有些苍茫的悲凉中，获得某种顿悟。参透一切苦厄，把身外之物看淡，豁达、潇洒，了无牵挂，无忧而有喜。这便是一种“出世”的思想，是指从总体上看，要把世事看淡。</p>
<p>朱光潜曾说：“以出世的态度做人，以入世的态度做事。”人活着要谋生，要做事，不论是为自己，还是为社会，都来不得半点虚妄。</p>
<p>太阳每日升起，每日落下，一个人的一生能看到几次日出日落的景致？因此就要珍惜，决不虚度光阴。春花秋月，赏心乐事，酷暑严冬，勤勉苦辛。要每日都过得充实、有意义，有益于人，也有益于自己。积极，有效，把眼前做的每一件事，都看成盛大的庆典，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。不悲观，不厌世，一步一步坚定地向前走去。明知愈走愈接近那谁也无法逃避的终点，却始终是坚定地前行。这样的人生，才是摆脱了大悲苦而拥有大欢喜的人生。</p>
<p>采薇图</p>
<p>治家篇</p>
<p>古往今来，家庭向来为社会的基石，古训有修身、齐家、治国、平天下的名言，原文是“古之欲明德于天下者，先治其国；欲治其国者，先齐其家；欲齐其家者，先修其身；欲修其身者，先正其心……心正而后身修，身修而后家齐，家齐而后国治，国治而后天下平。”</p>
<p>大意是说：古代那些要使美德彰明于天下的人，要先治理好他的国家；要治理好国家的人，要先整顿好自己的家；要整顿好家的人，要先进行自我修养；要进行自我修养的人，要先端正他的思想……思想端正了，然后自我修养完善；自我修养完善了，然后家庭整顿有序；家庭整顿好了，然后国家安定繁荣；国家安定繁荣了，然后天下平定。</p>
<p>这是儒家知识分子尊崇的信条。以自我完善为基础，通过治理家庭，直到平定天下，是几千年来无数知识分子的最高理想。然而实际上，成功的机会少，失望的时候多，于是又出现了“穷则独善其身，达则兼济天下”的思想。“正心、修身、齐家、治国、平天下”的人生理想与“穷则独善其身，达则兼济天下”的积极而达观的态度相互结合补充，几千年中影响始终不衰。</p>
<p>养子如养女，最要谨慎严</p>

<p>注释</p>
<p>①弟子：子弟，指男孩子。</p>
<p>②匪人：坏人，品行不端的人。</p>
<p>③嘉禾：指长得特别茂盛的稻谷。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>培养男孩子，要像养育女孩子那样谨慎才行，最关键的是要严格管束他们的出入和注意所交往的朋友。万一不小心结交了行为不正的人，就好像是在良田之中播下了坏种子，从此就可能一辈子也难长成有用之材。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>从古至今，中国人对子弟的教育一直都非常重视，并且在这方面做出了巨大的贡献。孔子说：小时候培养的品格就像是生来就有的天性，长期形成的习惯就像是完全出自自然。人的性情本来很近，但因为习染不同便相差很远。孔子为了教育事业，培养出了一批又一批的栋梁之材，他的学生大多数都成了思想家、教育家。</p>
<p>中国人重视子弟的教育，尤其重视外部环境的选择。《列女传》记载孟母教子的故事，很能说明这一问题。孟轲的母亲，很懂得人的道德学问是逐渐养成的，所以对孟轲平时生活和学习上的细节十分重视，通过“渐化”的方式培养孟轲的好习惯。起初，孟家离一处公墓不远，小孟轲看了一些送葬人的情景，自己就摹仿起来，成天在沙地上埋棺筑墓。孟母看出这地方对孩子影响不好，就搬了家。可搬的地方是一个集镇，小孟轲又学着那些挑提卖货的人吆喝叫卖，孟母只有又搬家。这次搬到了一所学校附近，小孟轲摹仿学校的孩子们，在游玩中摆弄俎豆祭器，学习揖让进退的礼仪，孟母才终于放心地说：这是我孩子可以居住的地方！</p>
<p>孟柯</p>
<p>可孟柯上学以后，有点贪玩，进步不大。有一次孟母问他：“学习得怎么样？”孟柯回答说：“还是那个样。”孟母听后，拿过剪刀就剪断了织机上的线，说：“你荒废学业，就像我割断织机上的线，布就织不成了一样，不好好学习，以后就只有成为供人使唤的下人。”孟轲从此拜孔子孙子的学生为师，勤奋学习，才终于成了著名的儒家代表人物。</p>
<p>融性情偏私，消家庭嫌隙</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>融得性情①上偏私，便是一大学问；消得家庭内嫌隙，才为火内栽莲②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①性情：性格、脾气。《宋书•沈文秀传》：“且此人性情无常，猜忌特甚，将来之祸，事又难测。”</p>
<p>②火内栽莲：火海内栽种莲花，即“火中莲”、“火生莲”，佛教语。语出《维摩经•佛道品》：“火中生莲花，是可谓希有。在欲而行禅，稀有亦如是后因以“火生莲”比喻虽身处烦恼中而能解脱，达到清凉境界。唐•白居易《新昌新居书事四十韵》：“浮荣水划字，真谛火生莲。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>与人相处要宽容，能够容忍别人性情上属于个性特征的那一面其实很不容易，善于及时消解家庭内部那些因鸡毛蒜皮引起的种种摩擦，就像在火里种植荷花那样，没有相当的道行是做不到的。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《论语》讲“礼之用，和为贵”。人生活在世间，离不开社会，也不可能离开群众而独自生存。与社会大众相处，便需要一份宽容心。</p>
<p>俗话说：大海的宽广在于汇集大大小小的川流，生命的汪洋在于包容深深浅浅的缘分。心，因为宽容而变得坦然；爱，因为宽容而成就伟大。父母养育子女，希望子女有一天知道感恩，有反哺的行为；子女接受父母的养育，在长大成人那刻起，就应该珍惜父母，同样也该珍惜手足情深的哥哥姐姐或弟弟妹妹；一个男人能孝敬父母，他才会懂得怎样珍惜女人，那种对自己有养育之恩的父母都不顾的男人，又怎能对“半路”认识或经人介绍恋爱结为夫妻的女人珍惜疼爱？一个不懂怎样孝敬公婆的女人，又怎么能教育出品格优良的子女？</p>
<p>一些人把金钱、权力看得最重要，家庭成员之间因为金钱而发生战争，甚至闹上公堂。然而，人生在世短短几十年，离开人世时，金钱与权势又有哪一个能带走？在世界上50多亿人中，既然彼此有了父子母女兄妹之缘，为什么不好好珍惜呢？</p>
<p>悠闲镇定士，宽洪长厚家</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>大烈鸿猷①，常出悠闲镇定之士，不必忙忙②；休征③景福，多集宽洪长厚之家，何须琐琐④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①大烈鸿猷（yóu）：重大的事业和谋划。烈，功业；鸿，大；猷，谋略。</p>
<p>②忙忙：事物繁冗不容空闲的样子。</p>
<p>③休征：吉利的征兆。景福：大福。</p>
<p>④琐琐：细小卑贱的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>宏伟的功业，远大的谋略，常常出自于悠闲镇定的人士，没必要总是那么匆匆忙忙；吉祥的预兆，齐天的洪福，多聚集于宽宏大量的人家，何必计较那些细碎琐屑的事情。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>悠闲镇定是一种做人的高尚境界。之所以能成大事，是因为能够控制自己的感情，从容谋划。</p>
<p>《世说新语•雅量篇》中记载着一些关于谢安遇大事而从容镇定的故事。有一次，谢安和孙绰等人乘船游海，遇上大风浪。孙绰等人“色并遽”，高呼要返航。而谢安则“神情方王（旺），吟啸不言”，神态悠闲、愉悦。后来风浪越来越大，“诸人皆喧动不坐”，而谢安不慌不忙地说：“如此，将无归。”意思是：像你们这样惊慌失措，恐怕回不去了。大家听了谢安的话，也都安静下来了。谢玄在淝水一战大破前秦苻坚的几十万大军。喜讯传来时，谢安正在与客人下围棋，“默然无言”，照常下棋。客人问前方战况，他才慢条斯理地说“小儿辈大破贼”，而“意色举止不异于前”。如此重大的喜庆之事，他却能不形于色，真可谓名士风度。</p>
<p>这样的事实证明，历史上真正有大作为的人，恰恰是那些“性定”之人。而那些成就巨大人生功业的人，不会像普通人那样成天忙忙碌碌，疲于应付，而是活得悠闲自在。而真正有福的人，往往宽宏大量、朴实厚道，而不是在金钱利益上斤斤计较。做人的境界高低决定了一个人一生成就的大小。好比真正会打仗的人，往往不会亲自操刀上阵，或百步穿杨。诸葛亮曾说关羽、张飞皆“万人敌”，他们的武功比诸葛亮强多了。但是一个武功比关、张差百倍的人，却能够指挥他们，成了百万人敌，千万人敌，让拥有百万精兵、千万人口的敌国为之胆寒。“运筹于帷幄之中，决胜于千里之外”，靠的不是单打独斗的本领，而是过人的谋略、天才的眼光和伟人的胸襟。</p>
<p>家庭有真佛，日用有真道</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>家庭有个真佛①，日用有种真道②，人能诚心和气，愉色③婉言，使父母兄弟间形骸两释④、意气交流⑤，胜于调息观心⑥万倍矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①真佛：真正的佛，此当信仰。</p>
<p>②真道：真正的道。道，真理。</p>
<p>③愉色：脸上的快乐神色，据《礼记•祭义》篇：“有和气者必有愉色，有愉色者必有婉言。”</p>
<p>④形骸两释：人我之间没有身体外形的对立，即人与人之间和睦相处。</p>
<p>⑤意气交流：彼此的意态和气概互相了解、互相影响。</p>
<p>⑥调息观心：佛道两教都把静坐和坐禅称为调息，是取静坐和坐禅调理呼吸，保持内部肌体运转自如的意思。观心，观察自己的行为，反省自己。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>任何家庭中应该有一种真诚的信仰，日常生活遵循正确原则，这样能保持纯真的心性，言谈举止温和愉快，使父母兄弟之间相处得很和睦融洽，这比用静坐省察自己身心还要好上千万倍。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有一次，滕文公问孟子：“我们滕国是一个小国，又处在齐楚两个大国之间，我们依附哪一个好呢？”孟子回答说：“你这个问题我回答不了。如果你硬要我说，我只能告诉你，挖深护城河，加固城墙，和你的百姓一道来保卫你的国家。如果你的百姓宁死也不肯离开，那你就谁也不用依附了。”</p>
<p>家和万事兴。“和为贵”、“和气生财”，都是古训。齐家如此，治国亦如此。从一个国家的兴衰强弱来说，在于人民的戮力同心、众志成城。众志成城则无惧。周朝大封同姓诸侯，宗室繁多，互相倚赖，长久不衰。六朝互相猜忌，动辄殴斗，终于相继灭亡。北狄的吐谷浑阿豺有二十个儿子。当他病重时，召见同母所生的弟弟慕利延说：“你拿一支箭来把它折断。”慕利延一下子就把箭折断了。阿豺又说：“你再拿十几支箭来把它折断。”慕利延折不断。阿豺说：“你们知道吗？一支箭容易折断，很多支箭在一起就很难摧折，可见你们必须同心协力，国家才能巩固。”</p>
<p>念积累之难，思倾覆之易</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>问祖宗之德泽①，吾身所享者是，当念其积累之难；问子孙之福祉②，吾身所贻③者是，要思其倾覆之易。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①德泽：恩惠，恩泽。《汉书•食货志》中有“德泽加于万民”。</p>
<p>②福祉：幸福，利益。祉，福。</p>
<p>③贻：遗留，留下。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>要问祖宗给我们留有什么恩惠，我们现在所享有的一切就是祖宗留下来的恩惠，我们需要铭记祖宗为我们留下这些恩惠非常不容易；要问子孙后代有什么样的幸福生活，就要看我们为子孙后代留下的恩惠有多少，要考虑到家业颠覆衰败是非常容易的。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>我们现在享有的一切，是祖宗留下来的。我们现在创造的一切，是将来能够遗留给子孙后代的。享受祖宗创造的家业，应时常想着他们创业艰难，留下来这份家业非常不容易，如此一来能够使我们更珍惜祖宗创造的家业，珍惜生活。我们现在创造的一切，将来是要留给子孙后代的，也要时常考虑家业创造虽难，家业衰败却是非常容易的事情。《诗经》中说：“哀哀父母，生我劬劳；养我育我，不辞劳苦。”父母养育子女实在是非常不容易，既要为子女的衣食住行忙碌，又要为子女的教育问题费心。父母创造的家业，更是来之不易，所以我们需要体谅父母长辈，孝敬父母长辈。</p>
<p>美国石油大亨洛克菲勒到酒店住宿，经常住的是普通客房。侍者感到很奇怪，他问洛克菲勒：“您的儿子每次来本酒店住宿，都要住最好的房间。您是他的父亲，为什么却住在普通房间里？”洛克菲勒回答说：“那是因为他有一个百万富翁的爸爸，我爸爸却不是百万富翁。”洛克菲勒在住酒店时的节俭，体现了明智的富翁们不会把自己的钱挥霍出去，而是将钱用在该用的地方上。例如捐款支持教育卫生等公益事业以及慈善事业，洛克菲勒并不小气节俭。当然洛克菲勒在住酒店时的节俭，更体现了创业者懂得创业艰难，从而更懂得珍惜来之不易的财富。有句话说“富不过三代”，这句话虽然有些片面，但是很多现象也确实证明了这句话还是有一定道理的。创业难守业更难，要想保持祖宗留下来的家业，要时常想想祖宗创立家业的辛苦，从而使自己戒除奢侈浪费、好逸恶劳等不好的习惯。</p>
<p>为子孙后代考虑，明智的人会考虑得很全面。为子孙后代留下的家业，也要看子孙后代是不是能干贤良的人。我国古代有些很明智的大臣，知道自己的子孙才干一般，当自己退位的时候就不推荐子孙接替自己的位置。因为他们知道，子孙的才干一般，如果让他们担任重要职位，不仅会对国家不利，更会为子孙们招惹来祸害。汉朝时的开国大功臣萧何，他在选择住宅的时候，选择的是那些穷僻的地方。他的理由是：子孙后代如果贤惠，那么必然会像我一样，甘于俭朴的生活。如果子孙后代不贤惠，住宅建造在风水极佳的所在，反而会被有权势的人抢夺走。</p>
<p>警家人之过，如春风解冻</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>家人有过，不宜暴扬，不宜轻弃。此事难言，借他事而隐讽①之；今日不悟，俟②来日正警之。如春风之解冻，如和气之消冰，才是家庭的型范③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①隐讽：借用其他事物来暗示，婉转劝人改过：</p>
<p>②俟：等待。</p>
<p>③型范：典型模范。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>如果家里的人犯了什么过错，不可以随便大发脾气乱骂，更不可以用冷漠的态度漠不关心，放任不管；如果他所犯的错你不好直接批评可以借其他事情来暗示让他改正；如果没办法立刻使他悔悟，就要拿出耐心等待时机再提醒劝告。要谆谆善诱，就好像春天温暖的风一般，能消除冰天雪地的冬寒，要像温暖的气流一样能使冬天冻得如石块的冰完全融化，这样充满一团和气的家庭才算是模范家庭。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《论语》说：你听说别人罪过的实情后，应该哀之怜之，而不应该庆幸自己获得了真相。这也就是《尚书》上说的，法官落实了罪证，应该起哀怜之心。</p>
<p>其实，人不是圣贤，谁能没有缺点过失呢？有人小气贪财，有人情多好色，有人懒惰，有人马虎，有人浮躁，有人懦弱……平时生活得好好的，可是在一定的时候，一定的条件下，可能就走错一步，做下错事，有的人知道了别人的过失，取作谈笑，幸灾乐祸；而有些人则不同，他们心里仿佛被揪了一把，说，噢，这人做了这件错事，可怜可惜，似责备，似同情，似理解，又似自伤自警。两种态度，两种人格，相形之下，高低立刻就显出来了。</p>
<p>曾有这样一个故事：文革期间，有些工商资本家的资金房屋等被没收、冻结了。落实政策后，又退还给他们。有这么一家，政府退还了十几万人民币和房屋后，父亲就把这些都分给了孩子们。三个儿子各分得几万元，最小的是女儿，将来是嫁出去的人，所以只分得五千元。小女儿看见几个哥哥都是几万元，而自己却只有一个零头，心里很不满意。后来又分房子，三个儿子每人一统间，是大房间，而且卫生间、煤气灶俱全。小女儿分到后楼一间小小的黑屋，心里更不痛快了，越想心里越难受，悲伤地哭了。父亲见状，就教训了她一顿，她心中更来气了。吃饭时，她因哭得悲伤之故，气不顺，憋得回抽，一抽搐，手一抖，碗“啪”地摔碎在地上。父亲一看，啊！你还摔碗给我看，啪啪就是两耳光。这一打，更冤枉了她，悲痛之极，她就上吊自尽了。父亲看女儿死了，心里很悲伤，也怨自己处理不当，结果闯了祸，心里抑闷，后悔不已，不多久也死了。</p>
<p>这个故事说明做父母的对子女有偏激的思想，如果父亲处理这个问题，能够处理得恰当的话，把个中道理说明白，而不是采取这样的方法和粗暴的态度，那么也就不会发生这样的悲剧了。子女有过错，不能袖手旁观，但是如果采取粗暴的方法教育子女，除了打骂就是冷嘲热讽，这样不但不能起到正面的教育作用，反而会起反效果。子女会更加感到备受冷落，也必然会令他们更加感到没有家庭的温暖，得不到亲情的关怀和鼓励，从而使他们产生一种厌恶家庭的心理，这样必然会造成恶性循环，所以一个家庭只有“如春风解冻，如和气消冰，才是家庭的型范。”</p>
<p>处骨肉从容，遇朋友剀切</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>处父兄骨肉之变，宜从容①，不宜激烈；遇朋友交游之失，宜剀切②，不宜优游③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①从容：镇静不慌乱。</p>
<p>②剀切：切实、直接了当。</p>
<p>③优游：柔和、模棱两可。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当遇到父母兄弟或骨肉至亲之间发生家庭纠纷或人伦惨变事故时，应该保持沉着、从容的态度，绝对不可以感情用事，采取激烈言行而把事情弄得更坏；当跟知心好友交往时，万一遇到朋友有什么过失，应该亲切诚恳地直言规劝，绝对不可以由于怕得罪人而模棱两可，眼看着他继续下去。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>相传，王安石身居太师之位时曾做过半首诗：“黄昏风雨过园林，残菊零落满地金。”苏东坡认为菊花不会落瓣，便续写了两句：“秋花不比春花落，为报诗人仔细吟！”王安石因为苏东坡的无知，把他贬谪黄州。后来，苏东坡在黄州亲眼目睹了遍地落黄，认识到错改王安石的“咏菊”诗是多么愚蠢的事情。恰逢此时，冬至将至，苏东坡领命上朝进贺表，正好可以了却当面向王安石赔罪的心愿。记起到黄州上任时王安石嘱咐他取瞿塘中峡水之事，于是从水路走，可顺便取中峡之水。顺流而下，一泻千里，因鞍马颠簸、身体困倦，不觉睡过去了，没有吩咐水手打水，到醒来时已是下峡，过了中峡。东坡赶紧吩咐拨转船头，要取中峡水，但逆水行舟，很是费劲，而且用不上力。遇见一个老者，问三峡哪一峡水好。老者说：“三峡水昼夜不断，难分好坏。”东坡想：“何必一定要取中峡水呢？”叫个水手将下峡水装满了一瓮，回到黄州，写好了进表。</p>
<p>星夜赶到东京，到了相府见了王安石，东坡对错改诗句一事，拜伏于地，表示谢罪。王安石说：“你没看见过这不怪你。”便问带中峡水的事情。东坡说已经带来了。王安石赶紧取来瓮，命令下人生火煮水，冲泡阳羡茶，但茶色半晌方见。王安石问：“此水何处取来？”东坡答：“巫峡。”王安石说：“是中峡水了。”东坡答：“正是。”王安石笑着说：“又来欺老夫了，此乃下峡之水，如何假名中峡？”苏东坡大惊，说是问过当地有经验的老者，告诉三峡之水都一样。于是听信了他取了下峡之水，并问：“老太师怎么辨别出来了？”王安石教育他读书人不可轻举妄动，凡事要寻根究底，并向他解释：“上峡水性太急，下峡太缓，只有中峡缓急相半。太医院宫乃明医，知老夫患中脘变症，故用中峡水引经。此水煮阳羡茶，上峡味浓，下峡味淡，中峡浓淡之间。今见茶色半晌方见，故知是下峡。”</p>
<p>东坡听后，心悦诚服，离席谢罪。王安石又安慰他说没有什么罪，并指出他因过于聪明，容易疏略。王安石没有斥责苏东坡这次做错事还想蒙混过关，而是一方面中肯地指出东坡过于聪明，反而不能寻根究底，容易犯自以为是的毛病，另一方面又向东坡介绍三峡之水上中下峡的区别，使东坡心悦诚服。</p>
<p>王安石</p>
<p>父慈与子孝，俱合当如是</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>父慈子孝、兄友弟恭，纵做到极处，倶是合当①如是，著不得一毫感激的念头。如施者任德②，受者怀恩，便是路人，便成市道③矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①合当：应该。</p>
<p>②任德：以施恩惠于人而自任，受人感激。</p>
<p>③市道：交易市场。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>父母对子女的慈祥，子女对父母的孝顺，兄姐对弟妹们的友爱，弟妹对兄姐的尊敬，即使付出全部的爱做到最完美的境界，也都是骨肉至亲之间应该做的，因为这完全都是出于人类与生倶来的天性，彼此间不须存有一丝感激的念头。假如父母养育子女，兄姐友爱弟妹，个个都怀着一种施恩图报的观念，以及子女对父母的孝顺，弟妹对兄姐的尊敬，也都怀着感恩图报的心理，那么就是将至亲骨肉之间的关系当作了陌路人来看待，真诚的骨肉之情就会变成一种市井交易了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>从前有一个孝子孝顺父母，传到皇帝的耳里，皇帝非常感动，把孝子召来，给他许多的钱以表示赏赐之意，孝子很不安地回答说：“陛下，我从来就没有感觉过我是尽了人子的孝行。实在没有接受陛下褒扬的理由，也绝不敢接受陛下的赏赐。”皇帝听后，更加感动，加倍赐赏钱给他，要他无论如何都得接受。</p>
<p>如此看来，真正的孝心是发自内心的，感觉不到自己在行孝义才是对父母的真正孝道。过去的传统观念都是“养儿防老”，如今随着计划生育的实行以及时代的进步，父母与子女骨肉至亲之间更多的是出自真情之爱，是发自人伦思想的天性使然。</p>
<p>而影响华夏民族千百年的儒家思想，以“仁”为核心，讲求敬奉父母，爱护妻儿兄妹，是仁爱的根本。仁爱缘于传宗接代的血亲关系。人之爱人，是从爱自己的亲人开始的，只有爱自己父母、妻子、儿女的人，才可能爱天下的老人、妇女、儿童。</p>
<p>同时，“仁”还需“礼”做保证。孔子说：“克己复礼为仁。”人有欲，又容易随便放纵，这样就难免顾己不顾人，难免变对人施爱为与人争夺，这样，天下就乱了，仁也就无法存在了，礼就是要对人有所规范，在规范中保证仁的实现。例如父慈子孝、兄友弟恭，这些家庭关系的礼节，就是为了一家人和融相处。又如，对朋友诚信不欺，与人相交礼敬为先，这些人际关系的礼节，是为了在社会上与人之间的和融相处。</p>
<p>富贵更炎凉，骨肉尤妒忌</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>炎凉之态，富贵更甚于贫贱；妒忌之心，骨肉尤狠于外人。此处若不当以冷肠①，御以平气，鲜不日坐烦恼障②中矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①冷肠：缺乏热情。</p>
<p>②烦恼障：佛家语，例如贪、嗔、痴、慢、疑、邪见等都能扰乱人的情绪而生烦恼，就佛家来说这些是涅槃之障，故名“烦恼障”。《佛地论》：“身心恼乱不成寂静，名之为烦恼障。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>世态炎凉、人情高低、冷暖、厚薄的变化，在富贵之家比贫穷人家显得更鲜明；嫉恨、猜忌的心理，在骨肉至亲之间比跟陌生人显得更厉害。一个人处在这种场合，假如不能用冷静态度来处理这种人情上的变化，不能用理智的心态来控制自己不平的情绪，那就会天天处在烦恼的困境中了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>富贵的人与贫贱的人两相比较，按人情来说，富贵的人反而比贫贱的人不好。富贵的人为了求自己的名利，逐渐转移情感，趋向于利益的方面。对无利的方面，人情就淡薄了。总而言之，他的情感是随着对方而变动的。</p>
<p>反之，贫贱的人情感没有什么变动的，无论什么时候，他都以一样的态度来待人接物。所以，贫者比富者的人情还厚重。按理说，应是富者的人情厚而贫者要来得薄，事实正好相反。难怪孔子会慨叹地说：“为仁不富，为富不仁矣。”</p>
<p>荀子《性恶》中说：尧向舜问道：“人情怎么样？”舜答道：“人情很不好，又何必问呢？有了妻子，对父母的孝敬就差了；嗜好、欲望达到了，对朋友的信赖就差了，高官厚禄的愿望满足了，对君主的忠诚就差了，这就是人情呀！这就是人情呀！这很不好，又何必问呢？”只有贤良的人才不这样做。</p>
<p>明朝建文帝朱允炆执政后不久，燕王朱棣前来拜见皇帝。户部侍郎官卓敬秘密上书说：“燕王胆略才智都高人一筹，很像先皇朱元璋。他的封地北平文才武将辈出，金朝和元朝都在那里建都立业。我认为不如使燕王迁移到南昌，那样就可以断绝祸根了。刚萌芽还没有变化的是苗头，容易铲除，如果任由其发展壮大，铲除就不容易了。”朱允炆看了奏章，很是吃惊，他对卓敬说：“燕王是我的亲叔叔，是我的骨肉至亲，你怎么说出这样的话来？”卓敬回答说：“杨广和隋文帝是父子关系啊。”建文帝没有听从卓敬的建议。后来燕王起兵，攻入南京，自称为帝，也就是历史上的明成祖。</p>
<p>居官惟公廉，居家惟恕俭</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>居官有二语曰：“惟公则生明，惟廉则生威。”居家有二语曰：“惟恕①则平情，惟俭则足用。”</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①恕：用自己的心推想别人的心。《论语•卫灵公》：“子贡问曰：‘有一言可以终身行之者乎？’子曰：‘其恕乎！己所不欲，勿施于人。’”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>关于做官有两句格言说：“只有公正才能清明，只有廉洁才能威严。”关于治家也有两句格言：“只有宽容才能心情平和，只有节俭家用才能富足”。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>关于做官，有两句格言说：“只有公正才能清明，只有廉洁才能威严。”做官的居官人，只有大公无私，清正廉明，才能够明确是非观念，对事物作出正确的分析和判断，不至于犯错误。只有廉洁清白的人，不为自己谋取私利，这样才能树立威信，得到别人的拥护。关于治家，也有两句格言：“只有宽容才能心情平和，只有节俭家用才能富足。”一家人要有宽恕的心胸，要有乐观的人生态度，对家人和蔼可亲，这样才能够使全家人心平气和，和睦相处，能够勤俭持家，精打细算，才能使全家人过上富足的生活。</p>
<p>赵匡胤</p>
<p>大宋朝开国皇帝赵匡胤南征北战平定天下后的一天，他的将士们灭了后蜀，押回蜀主孟昶班师回朝，献上了缴获的战利品。其中一件稀奇之物引起赵匡胤的惊奇，原来那是孟昶使用过的溺器（夜壶）。这溺器，式样奇巧至极，并用七宝镶成，名贵无比，可谓历代罕见。赵匡胤见后叹息说：“连溺器也用七宝镶成，更用什么东西储盛食物呢？奢侈到如此地步，哪得不亡国！”于是，当着孟昶的面将那溺器摔了个粉碎，并对两旁的臣子们说：“人人应记取这个教训，要力戒奢侈糜烂行为。”满朝文武大受教育，社会风气也因此较为清明。</p>
<p>一天，他的姐姐魏国大长公主进宫见驾。赵匡胤见她身穿“贴绣铺翠”，引得宫女个个见羡。他就笑着说：“请你把这身翠服送给我，并希望你今后不要再用翠羽作衣饰了。”公主不以为然地笑道：“这些翠羽又不值几个钱，算不上什么奢侈吧？”赵匡胤正色道：“不能这么说，你穿了这种衣服，皇亲国戚和大臣豪富们就会照着样子做，这样翠羽价格必会飞涨，商贾要赚钱，必会用高价到处收购，翠鸟就会遭到大量捕杀，这难道不是你无形中造的孽吗？你爱鸟反而害了鸟。”</p>
<p>公主被说服后说：“我可以从此不用翠羽做衣饰，不过，你怎么还要乘旧銮舆（皇家出入用的车轿），你是大宋皇帝了，也该注意点威仪呀？”赵匡胤笑道：“威仪？我富有四海，不要说打造新銮舆，就是用金子来制造一个宫殿也不是办不到，可我一开此头，别人就会马上跟着效仿，此风一开，后果又会怎样？做皇帝只是为天下守财，而不能伤天下财，古训说：‘以一人治天下，不以天下奉一人。’如果我只想奉养自己，百姓还对我抱什么希望呢，当年我摔碎‘七宝夜壶’教育臣子的事，岂能忘掉？”</p>
<p>大长公主听后深受感动。此话传出后，文武百官也就不敢轻举妄动。由于赵匡胤平定天下后，能力戒奢侈，从而奠定了大宋基业。</p>
<p>当穷愁寥落，不可自废驰</p>

<p>贫穷的家庭也要把地打扫得十分干净，穷人家的女孩也要把头发梳理得干净整洁。家中景况虽然不豪华壮丽，却能保持高雅风度。有良好修养与德行的君子，遭遇穷愁困苦的时候，怎么能荒废懈怠呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有良好修养的人，遇到不如意的境况时，也不会自我懈怠，更不会就此垂头丧气、自暴自弃。大思想家孔子的一生，遇到很多挫折，理想不能得以实现，在现实中经常碰壁，但是孔子没有自暴自弃，也没有怨天尤人。他一方面痴心不改，无怨无悔；另一方面又很宽厚平和，乐天知命，对于各种横逆之事都能很巧妙地应付过去，谈笑中拨云见月，还心灵以一片宁静，一片仁和，一片慈悯，成就一种不可企及的浑厚博大。论幽默，这是幽默的最高境界，因而也是最不可企及的。因为孔子认识到，为人之贵，是尽量培养和发挥自己的才智与力量，不断努力；但个人的力量总是有限的，成败均非一己之力所能定，所以成功与失败，在尽了自己的努力之后，都没有什么好挂怀的，应能够宽容宁静甚至愉快地接受。</p>
<p>有一次，庄子身着带有补丁的粗布衣服，鞋上的系带没有了，便用麻绳系上，去见魏王。魏王见了说：“先生，你为什么如此困苦呢？”</p>
<p>庄子说：“这是贫穷，不是困苦。士人身怀道德而不能够推行，这是困苦；衣服坏了鞋子破了，这是贫穷，而不是困苦。这就是所谓德生不逢时啊。大王没有看见过那跳跃的猿猴吗？当它们碰到楠、梓、豫、章等高大的树木时，攀扯着这些数的枝干，在那里像国王一样自由自在、快乐地生活，即使是善于射箭的后羿和蓬蒙也同样对它们无可奈何。等落到柘、棘、枳、枸等刺蓬灌木丛中，尽管小心翼翼地行走而且不时地左顾右盼，但是内心仍然恐惧不已；这并不是筋骨变得僵硬而不再灵活，而是所处的生活环境对它们很不利，不能充分施展才能。”</p>
<p>君子生在天地间，其心的洁白清明，气质品格的高尚，即使流落到贫穷失意的境遇，也不可颓靡懈怠自暴自弃，如果妄自菲薄堕落了品格，那就等于明珠埋于粪土，美玉出了瑕疵，是多么可惜的事啊！</p>
<p>寒微之颂德，骨肉之孚心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>望重缙绅①，怎似寒微②之颂德？朋来海宇③，何如骨肉之孚心④？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①缙绅：原意是插笏板于带，古时官宦的装束，后成官宦的代称。缙，插，指插笏板；绅，束腰的大带。</p>
<p>②寒微：指穷苦百姓。</p>
<p>③海宇：海内，宇内，近海之地。《梁书武帝纪上》：“浹海宇以驰风，罄轮裳而禀朔。”</p>
<p>④孚心：贴心，可信。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在达官显贵之中享有威望，怎么能比得上穷苦百姓的颂扬？远方来的朋友，怎么比得上自己的亲人骨肉贴心可靠？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>为了保证农业生产，南朝梁时曾经规定了一项法令，禁止私自屠宰耕牛。有一次傅大昭的儿媳回娘家，回来时从娘家带回一块牛肉来孝敬傅昭，傅昭便对儿子说：“朝廷禁止屠宰耕牛，如今我们吃了这牛肉则犯法，告发到朝廷则害了亲家，还是将牛肉收下然后掩埋到后院吧。”傅昭用这种办法，不但保全了自身，也保护了亲家，两全其美。</p>
<p>梁武帝天监十一年，傅昭被任为信武将军、安成内史。安成郡中虽然有河流小溪，但河中却没有鱼，有一年盛夏，有人献给傅昭一些鱼。傅昭不愿意收，又不愿得罪送礼者，便又想了一个两全其美的办法，把鱼挂在大门上。别的送礼的人见了，便不好意思再送了。</p>
<p>天监十七年，傅昭任智武将军、临海太守。当时他的属地中有一处蜜岩，以前各任太守都把此地封为官地，借以收利。傅昭到任，立即下令解封，百姓们都可以随意采伐，这种与民同利的方法很快就得到当地群众的好感，他的名望也迅速得到提升。</p>
<p>傅昭死后被溢为“贞”，正是得益于淡泊、谨慎这两个立身之法。傅昭在走马灯似的更换朝代的魏晋南北朝时期能够立足于不败之地，靠的便是自己那份小心谨慎和清静无为之心。</p>
<p>饮宴之乐多，不是好人家</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>饮宴之乐多，不是个好人家；声华①之习胜，不是个好士子②；名位之念重，不是个好臣工③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①声华：好名声。</p>
<p>②士子：读书人，学子。</p>
<p>③臣工：群臣百官。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>经常饮酒聚会的家庭，不是一个好人家；爱好声色繁华、喜好虚名的人，不是一个正派的学子；对于名声和地位过于看重的人，不会成为一个好官吏。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>经常举行宴会，时常进行饮酒作乐的家庭，这样的人家不是一个好人家。常沉溺在快乐之中，灯红酒绿、夜夜笙歌，虽然快乐自在，只是这种生活恐怕不能保持长久。生活远不是一条平坦的大道，总是沉溺在快乐中，对于人生的苦难没有太多了解，这样当以后遇到挫折与困难的时候就会不知道如何面对。古往今来，即使是身为帝王，如果沉溺在欢乐之中，时常饮宴、寻欢作乐，不把心思放在正经事上，最终也不能享有长久富贵。历史上这样的事例非常多。隋炀帝过着奢侈靡费的生活，最终亡国丧身。南朝陈后主陈叔宝，生活非常奢侈糜烂，不喜欢处理政事，只喜欢和妃嫔宫女们游玩饮宴，最终落得亡国的下场。在《红楼梦》中，薛宝钗揶揄贾宝玉，说贾宝玉是富贵闲人，最难得的。因为富贵就不能清闲，如果清闲自在就不可能拥有富贵。即使是像贾宝玉这样靠祖宗享有富贵的，也还时常受到父亲的痛斥，一旦祖宗功德用完，也就不能再继续清闲自在了。</p>
<p>明太祖朱元璋教育太子，要太子了解民间疾苦，让太子观看农民住在什么样的地方，吃什么食物，穿什么样的衣服，使用什么样的器具。还让太子了解农民是怎样耕田纺织的。使太子了解百姓生活如何，从而促使太子关心百姓生活，同情百姓不幸遭遇，这样当太子继承王位之后，能够真正做一个关心百姓疾苦的好皇帝。从这些事例中我们可以发现，朴素无华的生活使人保持清醒头脑，保持积极进取的精神。奢华的生活容易使人丧失斗志，消磨人的志气。所以适当的饮宴可以调剂我们的生活，但是过多的饮宴就不是一种健康积极的方式了。对于一个家庭而言，最好不要沉溺在欢宴之中，这样才可以使家庭享有安稳平安的生活。</p>

<p>看破与认真，脱缰负重任</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>以幻境①言，无论功名富贵，即肢体亦属委形②；以真境③言，无论父母兄弟，即万物皆吾一体。人能看的破，认的真，才可以任天下之负担，亦可脱世间之缰锁④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①幻境：空虚境界。</p>
<p>②委形：上天赋予的形体。委，赋予。《列子•天瑞》篇：“吾身非吾有，孰有之哉？曰：是天地之委形也。”</p>
<p>③真境：超越一切物相的境界，即物我合一永恒不变的境界。《庄子•齐物论》中说：“天地与我并生，而万物与我为一。”</p>
<p>④缰锁：套在马脖子上控制马行动的绳索，比喻人世间的互相牵制。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>世事变幻无常，不论官位、财富、权势都是变幻无常，即使是自己的四肢躯体也属于上天赋予我们的形体，假如我们超越一切物相来看客观世界，不论是父母兄弟等骨肉至亲，甚至连天地间的万物都和我属于一体。一个人假如能洞察出物质世界的虚伪变幻，又能认得清精神世界的永恒价值，才可以担负起救世济民的重大使命，也只有这样才能挣脱尘世间功名利禄的束缚。</p>

<p>齐国有个叫闾丘邛的人，年方十八，他拦住齐宣王：“家贫亲老，愿为小吏。”宣王说：“你年龄太小，不能做官。”闾丘邛说：“你说得不对，古有颛项，行年十二而治天下，秦项橐七岁，为圣人师。由此可见，你只能说我无能而不用，不能说我年纪小而不用。”宣王说：“未见小马驹载重而行，同样，人也须成熟以后方能为国所用。”闾丘邛说：“你说得不对。寸有所长，尺有所短。骅骝骐骥，天下骏马，让它们与狸鼬在炉灶间比跑，骏马的速度未必能超过狸鼬。黄鹄白鹤，一举千里，让他们与燕子、蝙蝠在堂屋间比飞，鹄鹤的灵便未必能超过燕子、蝙蝠；辟间巨阙，天下利器，击石不缺，刺石不铿，但要拔出眼中的灰尘，它未必抵得上稻草，由此看来，年长的人与我何异？”宣王说：“你说得好！你为什么这么晚才来见我呢？”于是让他与自己同车回朝，委以官职。</p>
<p>佛陀言：“诸法因缘生，缘谢法还灭。”——一切皆幻；庄子曰：“天地与我同根，万物与我同体。”——一即一切，一切即一。所谓“幻迹”就像梦幻泡影，如镜花水月都是假借而来。所谓“真境”，实体真实而不虚。雨、雪、水、霜、露都是因温差的作用而假借现出各种不同的形态。这也可说是一种虚幻痕迹。其实，真实的境界不过是水的一体而已。上至日月星辰，下至人畜草木，也都是万象同根，天地一体，森罗万象莫不是由同一个真体假借各种形态而显示出来的种种幻迹。</p>

<p>①徼：求祈福解。</p>
<p>②喜神：喜气洋洋的神态。</p>
<p>③杀机：肃杀之气。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人间幸福不可勉强去追求，只要能经常保持愉快的心情，就算是追求人生幸福的基础；人间的灾祸有时难以避免，只要能排除怨恨他人的心绪，才算是远离灾祸的良策。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>塞翁养了一匹好马，住在边境的小城。有一天，塞翁的马跑到境外去了。邻居为他惋惜，他自己却并不以为然。反倒对邻居说：“丢失一匹马有什么关系呢？说不定还是一件好事呢。”果然，那马不久自己跑回来，还带回了一匹境外的骏马。邻人知道了，又来向塞翁道贺，塞翁也不以为然，他对邻人说：“这也算不得什么好事，有谁知道这马会不会给我带来祸事呢？”果然，不久塞翁的儿子骑着这匹马出去游玩，从马上摔下跌折了一条腿。这自然是一件祸事，但塞翁也不以为然。不久，境外少数民族大举进犯，边塞的青壮年都应征去打仗去了，大部分都战死在沙场，塞翁的儿子因为跌折了腿而不能去打仗和父亲一起保全了性命。</p>
<p>古人说：祸不虚至，福不徒来。塞翁失马，安知非福，道出了人世吉凶祸福的辩证。忧喜本是一家，吉凶本同一根。乱生于治，危生于安，井以其甘冽清纯而易竭，李以其苦涩难尝而可存。美玉藏之深山，因其珍贵却免不了会遭斧凿锤击而破，兰生于幽谷，虽无人观赏却能葆有自己的芬芳。木秀于林，本可得雨露润溉之便，领阳光沐浴之先，但木秀于林，风必摧之。吉凶祸福，其实总是相互包容，福中有祸，祸中有福，或者总能相互转化，祸能至福，福可生祸。</p>
<p>虽然，幸福与灾祸没有定数，谁也无法掌握命运。但是，幸福却要经过努力创造才能得到，只要保持乐观的人生态度，拥有开阔的胸怀，便能具备谋取幸福的基础。衣食无忧时，依旧做到节俭，能够为人谦虚，做到礼让，不傲慢，这样灾祸自然会退避三舍。</p>
<p>过俭为鄙吝，过让为曲礼</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>俭，美德也，过则悭吝①，为鄙啬②，反伤雅道③；让，懿行④也，过则为足恭⑤，为曲谨⑥，多出机心⑦。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①悭（qiān）吝：吝啬。</p>
<p>②鄙啬：小气，斤斤计较。</p>
<p>③雅道：正道，忠厚之道。《荀子•荣辱》篇：“君子安雅集解：“雅，正也，正而有美德者谓之雅。”</p>
<p>④懿行：美好的行为。</p>
<p>⑤足恭：过分恭维来取悦于人。《论语•公冶长》：“巧言、令色、足恭，左丘明耻也，丘亦耻也。”</p>
<p>⑥曲谨：指把谨慎细心专用在微小地方，有假装谦恭的意思。宋王安石《王深父墓志铭》：“故不为小廉曲谨而投众人耳目，而取舍、进退、去就必度于仁义。”</p>
<p>⑦机心：狡猾诡诈的用心。《庄子•天地》篇：“吾闻之吾师，有机械者必有机事，有机事者必有机心。机心存于胸中，则纯白不备。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>节俭朴素本来是一种美德，但是太过分节俭了就是小气，就会沦为为富不仁、斤斤计较的守财奴，这样反而会伤害到朋友之间的交往。处事谦让本来也是一种高尚的行为，但是谦让过分了，就会显得卑躬屈膝、谨小慎微不够大方得体，这样反而会给人一种好用心机的感觉。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>什么事都不能过分，过分的事往往会弄巧成拙。</p>
<p>为人要有品行节操才能立足，如果谦让至伪，节俭到吝，那么节俭的目的何在，谦让的初衷为何？这实际上是一种小人俗人的表现。节俭为美德，太过则有伤大雅。礼让是美行，太过则有失常态。所以，君子处世无“过”与“不及”，只须恰到好处。处于动乱的社会，人心陷溺已久，只知争夺权利，忘掉道德义行，以致风俗日坏，道德沦亡。要想使人心恢复，重整道德风俗，只有从生活上着手。首先应当制止奢靡浮华的生活和改正虚伪不诚的风气，使人人生活节俭朴实，养成崇礼的德性，在物质生活上不要太吝啬，或是太奢侈，在精神生活上要宁奉之拙、勿失之巧。做到这样，才能够转移风俗，振作人心。</p>
<p>心宽舒福厚，念迫促泽短</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>仁人心地宽舒，便福厚①而庆长②，事事成个宽舒气象；鄙夫③念头迫促，便禄薄而泽④短，事事成个迫促规模。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①福厚：福禄丰厚。</p>
<p>②庆长：吉祥可祝贺的事情多。</p>
<p>③鄙夫：人品鄙陋、见识浅薄的人。</p>
<p>④泽：恩惠。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>心地善良的人，由于心胸宽广、仁慈博爱，所以能享受丰厚长久的福禄，每件事都有宽广的景象；见识浅薄、人品鄙陋的人，由于心胸狭窄、目光短浅，所以受享的福禄也微薄短暂，每件事都形成只顾眼前、没有长久谋划、遇事紧迫的局面。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>心地善良待人宽厚的人，享受的福禄也丰厚长久。对于一个家庭来说，家人之间相处，同样需要彼此之间以宽容相待。这样做，可以使家庭保持和睦，家庭和睦才能享受长久福寿。有三个和尚遇到一起，他们看着眼前的破庙，揣测着这庙荒废的原因。大和尚说大概是以前的和尚们不够虔诚，不虔诚则菩萨不灵，菩萨不灵这庙当然会荒。二和尚摇头，他认为大概是从前的和尚们不够勤快，不去整治管理，所以这庙荒了。小和尚不以为然，他认为是和尚们不去积极化缘讲经，才使庙中香火不旺，由此使庙变成荒庙。三个和尚各执己见，谁也不能把谁说服。最后他们达成一致意见，各自以自己的方式努力使这座荒庙恢复生机，由此来判别谁的观点正确。于是三个人开始努力，大和尚虔诚念经礼佛，二和尚辛勤管理庙中事务，小和尚出去化缘争取香客。经过三个和尚的努力，庙中香火渐渐旺盛，恢复了往日生机。这个时候三个和尚开始争执，各说各的功劳。一个说是因为自己虔诚礼佛，感动菩萨显灵。一个说是因为自己辛勤管理，另一个说是因为自己积极化缘，争取来众多香客。三个和尚争来争去，没日没夜，也不再管其他事情。就这样渐渐庙中香火又不旺盛，渐有荒废的趋势。这时候和尚们才发现原来庙宇荒废，最主要的原因是和尚们不和睦。和尚不和睦，导致庙宇荒废。家人之间不和睦，家庭生活不会幸福。</p>
<p>保持家庭和睦，需要彼此之间宽容谦让，以宽厚仁慈之心对待家人，不事事计较。遵循道德，敬畏天理。谨守礼法，坚守节操。以恭恭敬敬的态度处理事情，心情愉悦时和颜悦色办事情，心情不愉悦时也不使不快的心情影响自己处理事情。得意的时候，不得意忘形，不欺负陷害他人，不傲慢失礼；失意的时候，不自暴自弃，以积极乐观的态度应对生活。如果具有这些优良品质，家人之间相处定能保持和睦，享有长久幸福。</p>
<p>除热恼身清，遣穷愁心乐</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>热不必除，而热恼①须除，身常在清凉台上；穷不可遣，而穷愁要遣，心常居安乐窝②中。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①热恼：因为热产生的烦躁。</p>
<p>②安乐窝：宋朝时邵雍为自己的住宅取名为安乐窝，这里指舒适安逸的地方。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>必消除暑热，因暑热而产生的烦躁与苦恼则必须除掉，除掉因热产生的烦恼后，人就好像常在清凉台上一样拥有清凉的心境；贫穷不容易排除，因为穷而产生的忧愁则必须排除，排除穷愁之后，人的心就好像常在安乐窝中一样快乐。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>暑热与贫穷都不是那么容易改变的，当不能轻易改变某些现状时，那就改变自己的心情，使自己不被这些事情困扰。生活中往往有许多事情不尽如人意，我们尝试着改变，却不是一朝一夕就能使之发生变化。还有一些情况，我们根本就无力改变。暑热的天气，不可能因为我们怕暑热，天气就变得清凉。穷困的生活，不可能一下子就发生变化。在这样的情况下，就需要我们改变自己的心情，换一种角度去看问题，以极强的忍耐力对待生活。</p>
<p>蓝女士原本有幸福的家庭，但是突然有一天她唯一的儿子车祸身亡。这个打击对于蓝女士而言是致命的，她一蹶不振，沉溺于丧子之痛中不能自拔。家人虽然对她这种状态非常担忧，却想不出什么办法来消除她的痛苦。这样过了很长一段时间，有一天蓝女士在一个偶然的机会中认识了一个在园林局工作的人。和这个人接触过几次，蓝女士渐渐对园艺发生了兴趣。她在自己的家中种了许多花木，这使她的痛苦在一定程度上得以排遣。她常把自己种植的花木折下来带给儿子，有一天她突然有了一个想法，她来到自己儿子出车祸的地方，在旁边的山路上开垦了一小块土地，在这块土地上种植了许多花木。这样日积月累，这块地方聚集了不少花木，每当春暖花开的季节，一片花海在春风中流光溢彩，使得经过此地的人们都为之驻足。蓝女士想有这些花木陪伴着儿子，他应该不会寂寞了吧。蓝女士在培植花木的过程中，也使自己的痛苦减轻了许多。生活中有许多烦恼与痛苦无法消除，这时就需要我们学会想方设法排遣烦恼，为自己的生活减压。</p>
<p>少事之为福，多心之为祸</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>福莫福于少事①，祸莫祸于多心。惟省事者方知少事之为福；惟平心者始知多心②之为祸。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①少事：没有烦心的琐事。</p>
<p>②多心：猜忌。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人生没有比无忧心琐事可牵挂更为幸福的了，而最大的灾祸没有比疑神疑鬼更可怕的了。只有那些终日劳碌的人，会知道无事一身轻才是最大的幸福；只有那些经常心如止水安祥平和的人，才知道最大的灾祸源于多心猜疑。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生的最大幸福，并非功名富贵，而是一生平安。正所谓少惹无谓的祸端，以避无妄之灾难，灾难原是由多事招来的。</p>
<p>孔子说：“宁武子在国家安定时是一个智者，在国家动乱时是一个愚人。他智的一面，别人赶得上，那愚的一面，别人无法赶上。”郑板桥有一传世风行的条幅：“难得糊涂。”他还说：“聪明难，糊涂难，由聪明而变糊涂更难。”孔子说的“愚”和郑板桥的“糊涂”之所以难做到，是因要想真正做到，不仅要靠忠心和勇气，更需要忍辱负重，运智劳神，殚精竭力。一个有为的人应当达到“大智若愚，大巧似拙”的境界，这样就不会被琐事缠身，不会为闲言困扰。而一个平常人的生活，也应该是以一坐平安无事没有任何祸端为幸福的。所有祸端多半是由多事而招来，多事又源于多心，多心是招致灾祸的最大根源。</p>
<p>汉朝时曹参奉召入朝为相，一切事务都遵照萧何时期的旧规办理，日夜畅饮美酒，无所事事。每每宾客来拜访想要劝说他一番，都会被曹参以喝酒谢绝。宾客刚要张口说话，曹参就又敬上美酒，一直喝到他们酒醉为止，始终没有机会说话。</p>
<p>惠帝知道后，责怪曹参不管事，嘱咐曹参的儿子中大夫曹窑回家去问曹参这是什么意思？曹窑停职回家，劝谏曹参。曹参很生气，反而打了曹窑两百鞭。</p>
<p>惠帝责备曹参说：“这件事和曹窑有什么关系？是我要他去劝你的。”曹参脱下冠冕谢罪说：“陛下的圣明和高祖皇帝比较，自己觉得怎么样？”惠帝说：“我怎么比得上先帝？”</p>
<p>溪山泛艇图</p>
<p>曹参又说：“微臣的才能和萧何比较，怎么样？”惠帝说：“你好像不如他。”</p>
<p>曹参说：“陛下说得很对。高祖皇帝和萧何定天下，法令已经非常清明，如今陛下以无事治理天下，参等谨守职务，遵循前规，不是很好吗？”</p>
<p>富贵嗜欲猛，宜带清冷气</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>生长富贵丛中的，嗜欲①如猛火，权势似烈焰。若不带些清冷气味，其炎焰不至焚人，必将自焚。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①嗜欲：多指放纵自己对酒色财气的嗜好。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>长在豪富权贵之家的人，不良嗜好的危害有如烈火，专权弄势的脾气有如凶焰；假如不及早清醒，用清淡的观念缓和一下强烈的欲望，那猛烈的欲火虽然不至粉身碎骨，终将会让心火自焚自毁。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的欲望是无止境的，有了财富还希望有权力，有了权力还希望满足其他想法。如果没有一个良好的道德水准，没有一定的理智，那么就容易胡作非为，任性胡来。从这个意义来说，欲念好比是烈火，理智好比是凉水；凉水可以控制烈火，理智可以控制欲念。</p>
<p>一个生长在豪富权贵之家的人，丰富的物质享受，会令人养成各种不良嗜好和喜欢作威作福的个性，但不良的嗜好对人的危害有如烈火，专权弄势的脾气对心性的腐蚀有如凶焰，假如不及时给一点清凉冷淡的观念来缓和一下他强烈的欲望，那猛烈的欲火虽然不致使人粉身碎骨，终将会让心火自焚自毁。</p>
<p>钟会、邓艾以两路大军攻灭西蜀，而钟会心生反意，想要据险自守，做个刘备第二，进而兵临长安灭魏，再起兵灭吴，一并天下于自己一人之手，但是担心邓艾为敌与自己作对。怎么办呢？钟会想到告伪状的方法，几次密报司马昭，说邓艾心存反意。司马昭毕竟是谋略场中的老手，他虽然担心邓艾逆反，对钟会却也有疑惧之意。接到钟会的密报，他对钟会真正用意就了如指掌了。他写信告诉钟会说：“邓艾有可能据兵自守，所以我派贾充领兵一万入斜谷，屯兵城，前去援助你。我自己领兵十万在长安，随时准备接手。”司马昭另派新兵之意当然不是为了邓艾，而是为了钟会。钟会也不是呆子，他见司马昭信便知是司马昭对自己起了疑心，便仓促行事，拥兵而反，最后被杀身亡了。本想告假状陷害邓艾，使自己阴谋得逞，不想被司马昭察觉而自陷死地。这正如老子说：“祸莫大于不知足，咎莫大于欲得。”一个人的欲望好比是烈火，理智好比是凉水，凉水可以控制烈火，理智可以控制欲望。当火势与欲望达到一定程度时，物就会枯焦，人就会粉身碎骨，所以人必须加强道德修养，缓和自己的强烈欲望，使自己健康地行走在人生的大道上。</p>
<p>念虑差毫末，人品星渊别</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>积货财①之心积学问，以求功名之念求道德，以爱妻子之心爱父母，以保爵位之策保国家。出此入彼，念虑②只差毫末③，而超凡入圣④人品，且⑤判星渊⑥矣。人胡不⑦猛然转念哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①货财：货物，财物。《礼记•曲礼上》：“贫者不以货财为礼，老者不以筋力为礼。”</p>
<p>②念虑：思虑。《淮南子•说山训》：“念虑者不得卧。止念虑，则有为其所止矣。”</p>
<p>③毫末：毫毛的末端，比喻极其细微。《老子》：“合抱之木，生於毫末；九层之台，起於累土。”</p>
<p>④超凡入圣：超越凡俗，达于圣界。语本唐•吕岩《七言》诗：“举世若能知所寓，超凡入圣弗为难。”</p>
<p>⑤且：将近，几乎。《列子•汤问》：“年且九十。”</p>
<p>⑥星渊：天壤之别，比喻差别大。清•褚人获《坚瓠集•两大宰嚭》：“两太宰嚭何忠佞星渊哉！”</p>
<p>⑦胡不：何不。《诗•鄘风•相鼠》：“人而无礼，胡不遄死？”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>用积聚货物财产的心思积聚学问，用求取功绩名誉的意念追求道德，用爱护妻子儿女的心意敬爱父母，用保持爵号官位的策略保卫国家，走出这里进入那里，意念思虑只是差别毫毛末端，但是超脱凡俗进入圣界，人的品质几乎判若天壤之别了。人何不猛然转变念头呢！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>凡事要想成功，最关键的就是有一份责任心。若能把所有的事情都当作是自己性命攸关的事情，还会有什么事是做不成做不好的呢？积累学问是件艰苦的事情，但若能像积攒钱财那样处心积虑，就会知道自己该怎样具体去做才能积累更多的学问了。道德修行看起来空洞，但若能像求取功名那样目标明确，追求道的修行的行动就会有动力了；把对妻子儿女的那份爱心用来孝顺父母，用保持官位的那份策略之心来捍卫国家，还有什么是不能做到最好的呢！放弃私利的、个人的、渺小的，而致力于大事、公务，这些想法、打算，在人的内心也许只有微小的那么一点差别，但这一转念的事情对于人品来说却是天壤之别。</p>

<p>耳中常闻逆耳①之言，心中常有拂心②之事，才是进德修行的砥石③。若言言悦耳，事事快心，便把此生埋在鸩毒④中矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①逆耳：刺耳难听。</p>
<p>②拂心：不顺心。</p>
<p>③砥石：磨刀石。</p>
<p>④鸩毒：毒酒。鸩，传说中有毒的鸟。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>耳中常听一些不顺耳难听的话语，心中常想着一些不顺心的事情，这才是使人修养身心、培养良好德行的磨刀石。如果每句话都顺耳好听，每件事都能称心如意，那就是把自己的一辈子都浸泡在毒酒之中了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人们常说“忠言逆耳利于行，良药苦口利于病”，听起来不那么动听悦耳的话语，往往对于人们培养良好德行具有重要作用。相反一些甜言蜜语，听起来悦耳动听，对于人却没有实际作用，有时还会起到危害作用。假如人事事顺心如意，长此以往，便会习惯于这样。当遇到困难，遇到不如意的事情时，往往不知道如何应对。宝剑是越磨砺越锋利，长时间不磨就会生锈。人也是如此，本领都是由磨砺中得来。有意识地磨砺自己，长时间坚持下来，一定会有所收获。对于少年人来说，要想使他们将来有好的发展，在某一领域取得一定成绩，就需要给他们以磨砺。玉不琢不成器，要想成才必须从小雕琢磨砺。</p>
<p>有一位有名的书法家，他的字写得非常好。当他肯招收学生时，有很多家长争着把孩子送到他那里学习。其中有一个叫蓝冰的孩子，非常聪明，悟性很高。书法家的妻子问丈夫，蓝冰将来能不能成为一名出色的书法家。书法家回答说不太可能，因为蓝冰家有几亿家产，他是家中唯一男孩，父母宠爱如珍宝。舒适的生活环境，往往难以产生有为的青年。自古英雄多磨难，纨绔子弟少伟男。名将戚继光自小受到父母良好教育，父亲对他的要求十分严格，在戚继光很小的时候就教他读书识字，学习武艺。父亲常给他讲一些保家卫国与为人处世的道理。每天早晨，天刚一亮，父亲就把戚继光叫起来，让他练习武艺。每天跑步练剑，为了练臂力还要举石锁，这样一天下来，戚继光经常身体酸疼。父亲虽然心疼孩子，对他的要求却没有放松。练习武艺之外，父亲为他布置了学习任务，各种经书兵书，历史典籍，都是戚继光学习的内容。在父亲的严格要求下，戚继光自小就培养了良好品质，吃苦耐劳力求上进，成为一代名将。对少年人严格要求，那他们成年之后面对世界的各种艰难能够较从容面对。如果过于溺爱他们，不肯让他们吃点苦，那么将来社会是会让他们吃苦的。</p>
<p>天地有和气，人心有喜神</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>疾风怒雨，禽鸟戚戚①；霁②月光风，草木欣欣③。可见天地不可一日无和气，人心不可一日无喜神④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①戚戚：忧愁恐慌的样子。据《论语》：“君子坦荡荡，小人长戚戚。”</p>
<p>②霁：雨后天晴。</p>
<p>③欣欣：草木繁茂的样子。</p>
<p>④喜神：吉祥喜庆的神，这里指人心神愉悦的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>狂风暴雨中，各种飞禽鸟类都感到忧愁恐慌；风和日丽的好天气，草木欣欣向荣长势茂盛。由此可见天地之间没有一天可以没有和气，人心也没有一天可以没有喜气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《智囊》上有这样一个故事，说的是某地有一个姓尤的老翁，他家开了三个典当铺。有一年年底的一天，尤老翁听到自家门外传来一阵吵闹声。他就出去看外面发生什么事情。原来是一位邻居，与伙计们争执。柜台前的伙计告诉尤翁说：“这个人把衣服当了钱，今天空着手来，非要取衣服。不给他，他就破口骂人。竟然有这样不讲理的人！”那人仍然不肯善罢甘休，气势汹汹不认为自己有错。尤翁从容地和他说：“我知道你的意思，不过是年关难度。为了这些小事，也不值得争执。”尤老翁派店里伙计把这个人典当的东西拿出来，有几件衣服和蚊帐。尤老翁指着棉衣服说：“这件衣服现在正用得着。”又指着那件道袍说：“这件留给你过年拜年用，其他的东西你现在也不急着用，可以先留在这里。”那人拿到衣服，没说什么，转身走了。当天夜里，他死在了别人家里，他的亲属就与那家人打官司。</p>
<p>原来这个人借了很多债，无力偿还。那天他服了毒药，知道尤家富有，就想死在尤家，好敲一笔钱。结果尤老翁宽容大度，使得他无法继续闹事，就转移到另外一个人家去。有人问尤老翁，为什么能预先了解情况而容忍这个人的无理。尤老翁回答说：“凡是来无理取闹的人，大概都是有原因的。如果在小事上不让人，那么就有可能惹来大祸。”人们听了他的话很佩服他的见识。尤老翁的和气待人，使他免了一场祸事。我们想长久保持家庭和睦，生活安稳，就需要有宽容的度量，和气待人。自己家人之间，不过于计较一些小事情，与别人交往时，也不斤斤计较。天地之间少不得和气，何况于人呢！我们更需要时常保持和悦喜庆，这样才能保持一个和睦幸福的家庭。</p>
<p>清冷受享薄，和暖福泽厚</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天地之气①，暖则生，寒则杀。故性气②清冷③者，受享④亦凉薄⑤；惟气和心暖之人，其福亦厚，其泽亦长。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①气：节气。</p>
<p>②性气：性情气质。</p>
<p>③清冷：寂静没有生气。</p>
<p>④受享：所享有的福分。</p>
<p>⑤凉薄：淡薄。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>大自然四季的变化，春夏气候温暖，万物就获得生长，秋冬气候寒冷，万物就失去了生机。所以，一个性情高傲冷漠的人，他的表情毫无生气，就像秋冬的天气那样冷漠无情无人敢接近，因而他所能得到的福分自然就淡薄。只有那些个性温和而又热忱的人，他所获得的福分不但厚，他的利禄也能长久。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子周游列国，行至沧浪水边，听到一个小孩在那里唱歌。歌中唱道：“沧浪的水清啊，可以洗我的帽缨，沧浪的水浊啊，可以洗我的双脚。”孔子听了大为感慨。他对他的学生们说：“学生们听着，水清可以洗帽缨，水浊就只能用来洗脚，这都是由水本身决定的啊。”这话很有嚼头。水的去取用度，全由水本身的质量决定，人的得福与招祸，取誉与遭辱，也全都由人自己的处世为人所决定。从人的立身行事来看，积善成德也许并不一定大福大贵，但不义行恶，却没有不招致祸患的。</p>
<p>范仲淹出身贫寒，年轻时过着非常贫困的生活。后来做了宰相以后，他的生活方式还是保持着从前穷秀才的习性。不仅如此，他接济贫苦的人，用自己的收入救济那些穷苦的人，受过范仲淹帮助的人有百人之多，他的行为也由此受到老百姓的称赞。</p>
<p>古人说，多行不义必自毙，这是至理。俗语说：恶有恶报，善有善报，恶报降祸，善报赐福。明白人都知道，这报那报，最终还是人报。从世道的运行看，顺天随势，便可得福，逆天违时，便会招祸，即使暂时得福，最终福也会变成祸。这一点，明白人也都知道。譬如毁林开荒，围湖造田，也许可以收获更多一点的粮食。曾有人说，手中有粮，心里不慌，冷静想想，那是没到着慌的时候。从长远看，生态平衡被打破，气候恶劣，受罪的还是自己，这祸想逃大约也是逃不了的。</p>
<p>念头存宽厚，春风育万物</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>念头宽厚的，如春风煦育①，万物遭之而生；念头忌克的，如朔雪阴凝②，万物遭之而死。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①煦育：煦，温暖，育是化育，由此而万物生长。颜延之《陶征士诔》：“晨烟暮霭，春煦秋阴。”</p>
<p>②朔雪阴凝：北方的雪阴冷久积不化。朔，北方；阴凝，雪因阴冷久积不化。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个胸怀宽宏忠厚的人，好比温暖的春风化育万物，能给一切具有生命的东西带来生机；一个胸襟狭隘斤斤计较的人，好比寒冷凝固的冰雪，能给一切具有生命的东西带来杀气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子认为：宽是人的五德之一（恭、宽、信、敏、惠）。为人宽容，能得到众人爱戴，为政宽容，能使有才干的人各尽其力。如果没有宽宏的气度，不论为人或为政，都会受到影响。而宽容是一种美，深邃的天空容忍了雷电风暴一时的肆虐，才有风和日丽；辽阔的大海容纳了惊涛骇浪一时的猖獗，才有浩淼无垠；苍莽的森林忍耐了弱肉强食一时的规律，才有郁郁葱葱。泰山不辞杯土，方能成其高；江河不择细流，方能成其大。宽容是壁立千仞的泰山，是容纳百川的江河湖海。</p>
<p>班固</p>
<p>《汉书•班固传》说班同为人宽和容众，不以才能骄人，深得大家喜爱。一个领导者气度宽大，才能使众人归心，为之尽力。《吕氏春秋•爱士篇》有一个故事：秦穆公丟了一匹拉车的马。找到的时候正被人煮了在吃。秦穆公叹一口气说：吃骏马肉不喝酒是不好的。于是给每个吃马肉的人一大碗酒。一年之后，秦晋大战于韩原，穆公被枪刺投中，战马已被晋军抓住，眼看就要成为俘虏。这时那曾经吃了马肉的三百多人冲了出来，个个舍生尽力，在穆公车下与晋人作殊死搏斗，终于大败晋军并俘虏了晋惠公。可以说，秦穆公转危为安，反败为胜，靠的是宽大容物的德行。</p>
<p>美国大文豪霍桑成名之前是个海关的小职员，有一天他垂头丧气地回家对太太说他被炒鱿鱼了。他太太苏菲亚听了不但没有不满的表情，反而兴奋地叫了起来：“这样你就可以专心写书了。”“是呀！”霍桑一脸苦笑地答道，“我光写书不干活，我们靠什么吃饭呀？”这时苏菲亚打开抽屉，拿出一叠为数不少的钞票。“这钱从哪里来的？”霍桑张大了嘴，吃惊地问。“我一直相信你有写作的才华。”苏菲亚解释道，“我相信有一天你会写出一部名著，所以每个星期我都把家庭费用省一点下来，现在这些钱够我们活一年了。”有了太太在精神与经济上的支持，霍桑果真完成了美国文学史上的巨著《红字》。</p>
<p>寒灯敝裘下，不失本来真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>寒灯无焰，敝①裘无温，不失本来面目；心似死灰，身如槁②木，未免堕落顽空。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①敝：坏，破旧。《墨子•公输》：“邻有敝轝（yú）而欲窃之。”</p>
<p>②槁：草木枯干。刘向《九叹•远逝》：“草木摇落时槁悴兮。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一盏微弱的孤灯燃不起火焰，一件破旧的大衣穿在身上毫不温暖，这是造化在玩弄世人；衰败的身体像是干枯的树木，而空虚的心灵也犹如燃尽的死灰，这种人就像是行尸走肉，必然会陷入冥顽的空境当中。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>惠子和庄子有这样一次对话：</p>
<p>惠子说：“一个人一点情都没有，还能称得上人吗？”</p>
<p>庄子说：“道给了他容貌，上天赐予他形体，怎么能不称作人呢？”</p>
<p>惠子说：“既然已经称作了人，又怎么能够没有情？”</p>
<p>庄子回答说：“你所说的情并不是我所说的情感。我所说的无情，是说人不因善恶而伤害自身的本性，要常常顺其自然而不祈求增加生命。”</p>
<p>惠子说：“不增加生命，靠什么来保护自己呢？”</p>
<p>庄子回答说：“道给了人容貌，上天赐予人形体，可不要因外在的好恶而致伤害了自己的本性。如今你消耗着自己的神智，耗费你的精力，站起来就倚着树吟咏，坐下就靠着几案睡觉。上天选择了你的形体，你却抱着‘坚’、‘白’的无理言论而喋喋不休！”</p>
<p>佛家说“色即是空，空即是色”，荀子也在《非相》篇中说：“观察一个人的容貌、体态，不如研究他的思想，研究他的思想，不如看他选择的思想方法。”</p>
<p>历史上，西周时徐国君主徐偃王的眼睛可以看到自己的额头；孔子面如凶神恶煞；周公身如直立的枯木；舜时掌管刑法的皋陶面色青绿，好像刚被削去皮的瓜；西周大臣闳夭满脸胡须，看不见皮肤；殷王武丁的大臣傅说脸上没有胡须和眉毛；大禹瘸腿，汤王跛足，尧和舜的眼睛里重叠着两个瞳仁。人们没有记住他们的容貌，但是人们记住了尧舜的仁政，大禹的治水，秦始皇的统一中国；人们记住了孔孟的仁义道德，老庄的自然无为，六祖的佛学与禅理；人们记住了张衡的地动仪，蔡伦的造纸，黄道婆的纺织技术；人们记住了李杜的诗，苏东坡的词，曹雪芹的小说；人们记住了伯牙鼓琴，王羲之的书法，唐伯虎的绘画……至于他们的相貌无人知晓，他们的生平只能猜想，他们的生卒年月尚待考证。但后人却记住了他们的丰功伟绩、创造发明、思想意志、文采风流，从中吸取智慧的养料，力量的源泉，创造的勇气与魄力。再美的花也会凋谢，再美的容貌也会消逝。只有灵魂不朽，只有精神长存！</p>
<p>肯休当下休，觅了无了时</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人肯当下休，便当下了。若要寻个歇处，则婚嫁虽完，事亦不少。僧道虽好①，心亦不了。前人云：“如今休去便休去，若觅了时无了时。”见之卓矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①僧道虽好：僧，僧人；道，道士；好，美、善，此处指清静、没干扰。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人无论做什么事，想要罢手时，就要当机立断结束。如果犹疑不决，想要找个更好的时机，那就像男婚女嫁一样，虽然婚事办完了，以后的家务和夫妻儿女之间的琐事却会接踵而来。出家当和尚和道士虽然不被人打扰能获得暂时的清净，他们的七情六欲却未必能够全部清除。古人说得好：“现在能罢休就赶紧罢休，若想再找个机会罢休，恐怕就永远没了罢休的机会。”这真是极高明的见解啊！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>身在情场，若不能挥剑斩情丝，只怕是剪不断，理还乱；身在商场，若面对难得的商机还是左顾右盼，只怕是商机会稍纵即逝。身在官场，若是决策起来拖泥带水，只怕是贻误了一方的大好发展机遇，也贻误了自己的大好前程。人世间，许多人该做了断时不能罢手，而伟人和那些明达事理的人大都能够看透这一关，他们对于大事了悟以后，万事都可以罢休。</p>
<p>范蠡追随越王勾践二十多年，苦其心志，运筹谋划，终于灭了吴国，报了会稽之辱。勾践称霸诸侯后，范蠡也被封为将军。但范蠡深知勾践为人，只可同患难，不可共安乐，于是急流勇退，携妻将子，扬帆过海，秘密离开了越国。范蠡辗转到了齐国，改名换姓，自称为鸱夷子皮，在海边定居下来。从此，率子整治家业，开发经营。没多久，就在海边积累了数十万财产，富甲齐国。齐国人看他贤能，又善于理财，便请他出来为卿相。范蠡喟然长叹：“在家能积聚千金，外出能官至卿相，对于普通人这是再高兴不过的事了，但长久地享受这些尊荣和名声并不吉利啊！”于足，又辞了卿相，把大部财产分给亲朋好友和邻里乡党，只随身藏着些珍贵的珠宝，秘密离开齐国，到达宋国的都城陶。范蠡看到陶位于天下的中心，与诸侯各国四通八达，来往货物都在此交易，认为此地经营很容易致富，便在陶定居下来，自称陶朱公。从此，父子刻苦节俭，亲自耕种畜牧，兼营商业。由于他们对商品的屯积或脱手，善于看准行情，把握时机，在贩进卖出之中，获取十分之一的利润，没几年，又积累了上亿的家产，天下都知道陶朱公了。</p>
<p>热闹出冷言，寒微用热心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>从热闹场中出几句清冷言语，便扫除无限杀机；向寒①微路上用一点赤热心肠，自培植许多生意②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①寒：穷困。微：衰落，低下。</p>
<p>②生：生存，活着。意：流露出来的情态。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在喧闹争吵的场合说几句清醒冷静的话语，便可消除无限争斗杀伐之心；对贫穷困苦的人多用一点火热的心肠，必然能培植出许多生存下去的意念。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在复杂的场合中，说几句公道话，便能化解许多麻烦。对贫困和地位低下的人，用一点热心肠，就能焕发出他们的意志，也就因此能栽培许多有用的人。</p>
<p>这里重要的不是言语形态，而是一片忠厚心肠。这就是人们所热切期待的“该出手时就出手”，一种为广大民众认同的侠义精神。古代下层民众身受自然灾害肆虐、黑暗政治压制，常常无可奈何，处于卑微的弱势，本身的利益与社会强势群体所规定的社会秩序之间充满了矛盾。侠义精神是在社会控制中出现的逾矩力量，这种力量是本真的，在现实的环境中又总是单个的、无力的、被压制的。然而现实生活中的压抑需要排解，于是这种逾矩的力量就呼之欲出，这是现实生活的战斗号角，给人以鼓舞力量。</p>
<p>宋真宗时李沆任宰相，王旦为参知政事。因为西北方的战事，两人废寝忘食地工作，王旦感慨地对李沆说：“我们怎么样才能悠闲无事、坐享太平呢？”李沆说：“稍有一些忧虑勤苦，才能警戒人心。将来如果西方都平定了，朝廷未必便无事。有句话说：‘外宁必有内忧。’譬如人有疾病，常常发作，就知道忧虑而去诊治。我死后，你必当宰相。与敌人和亲是大势所趋，一旦疆场无事，恐怕君王会慢慢产生奢侈之心。”</p>
<p>王旦不以为然。李沆又每天呈上各地水旱灾、盗贼及不孝作恶的坏事报告给真宗知道。真宗听了往往惨然变色，很不高兴。王旦认为这种琐碎的事不值得让天子烦心，而且丞相常常禀奏一些不好的消息，拂逆了皇帝的心意。李沆说：“君主还年轻，应当让他知道各地艰难的情况，经常怀着忧虑警惕之心。不然，血气方刚的皇帝如不沉迷歌舞、美色、珍玩，就可能搞些土木、战争、祭神之类的事。我老了，来不及看见，而这些都将会是你未来的忧虑啊！”李沆死后，真宗认为契丹已经讲和，西夏也来纳款，于是在泰山封禅祭祀，在汾水立祠祭神，大建宫殿，搜集亡失的典籍，没有个空闲的日子。王旦亲眼看见王钦若、丁谓等人的所作所为，想规谏却已经变成同流，想辞官又觉得皇帝如此厚遇，此时才知道李沆见识的深远。叹口气说：“李文靖（沆）真是圣人，看事情那么远！”</p>
<p>无事常提防，有事须镇定</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>无事常如有事时提防，才可以弥①意外之变；有事常如无事时镇定，方可以消局中②意之危。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①弥：弥补，消除。</p>
<p>②局中：处于事情当中。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>没有事情的时候常常像有事情时那样小心提防，这样才可以消除意外的变故；遇到事情的时候要像没有事情时那样镇定，这样才可以消除事情的危险性。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>没有遇到事情的时候，也需要小心谨慎。古人说“生于忧患，死于安乐”，这对于一个家庭来说同样是如此。想得多，想得远，这样才不至于遇到事情的时候手忙脚乱，不知道如何应付。当遇到事情的时候，就需要我们保持镇定，俗话说“是福不是祸，是祸躲不过”，真正遇到事情，既然不能躲避那么不如勇敢镇定地应对。保持镇定自若，有时候处于危险的境地中也能化险为夷。古人成大事业的人，很多都具有临危不惧，随机应变的品质。</p>
<p>春秋时，齐国发生内乱，公子纠逃到鲁国，公子小白逃到莒国。不久齐国人杀死国君齐襄公，齐国无主。公子小白与纠争着回国，谁先回去谁就能当上国君。公子纠与小白在中途相遇。当时管仲辅佐公子纠，于是用箭射杀小白。这一箭射中小白衣服上的钩子，小白当时立即大喝一声，随后倒下一动不动。管仲以为自己射死了小白，于是告诉公子纠放心，说小白已经被我射死了。小白其实没有死，他快马加鞭赶回齐国，成为齐国之君，也就是历史上的齐桓公。小白的机智应变能力很高，因此才骗得过管仲，最终赢得齐国君主之位。</p>
<p>楚汉相争的时候，项羽和刘邦说：“如今天下纷扰不定，都是因为你我二人，我愿意和你一决胜负，也省得天下人跟着我们白白送命。”刘邦笑说：“我宁可和你斗智，不愿意和你斗力。”项羽与刘邦远远对话，刘邦罗列了项羽十条罪状，项羽大怒，拿过弓箭射了刘邦一箭。这一箭射中刘邦的胸部，刘邦当即大叫说：“射中我的脚了。”刘邦卧病在床，张良让他起来安定军心，以防项羽乘胜追击。刘邦强忍着剧痛，到军中安定人心。刚从军营中出来，就难以再支撑下去，立即快马加鞭飞奔到成皋。刘邦的临机应变能力非常高，以此才能成就百年基业。齐桓公小白与汉高祖刘邦遇到事情镇定自若的态度，非常值得我们学习借鉴。在处理家庭中的事情，也需要有这种遇事不慌张的能力。</p>
<p>少年抑躁心，老成振惰气</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>少年的人，不患其不奋迅①，常患以奋迅而成卤莽，故当抑其躁心；老成的人，不患其不持重，常患以持重而成退缩，故当振其惰气②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①奋迅：精神振奋，行动迅速。</p>
<p>②惰气：惰性、懒惰懈怠。鲁迅《书信集致姚克》：“北平原是帝都，只要有权者一提倡‘惰气’，一切就很容易趋于‘无聊’的，盖不独报纸为然也。”《汉书成帝纪》：“间者，民弥惰怠，乡本者少，趋末者众，将何以矫之？”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>对于年轻人来说，不担忧他们做事不振奋迅速，反而会常常怕他们因为太快速了导致鲁莽，所以应当抑制他们的急躁性情。对于成熟稳重的成年人，不担心他们做事不稳重，反而会常常怕他们太谨慎稳重了而造成畏缩不前的行为，所以应当振奋他们的精神，抛弃懒惰懈怠的习气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗话说，老要张狂少要稳，这是古人的处世哲学，也是对世人的劝诫。少年时没什么经验，对人心的阴险，做事的困难都不了解，办事情容易毛手毛脚，所以年轻人平时要注意培养稳健踏实的习性，走路脚步要沉着不要轻浮，举止要稳重不要毛躁，更重要的是思想言行不能偏激，要沉稳厚重，温仁宽让，这样才能成大器。对于成熟稳重的成年人，不担心他们做事不稳重，反而会常常怕他们太谨慎稳重了而造成畏缩不前的行为，这种情况下，成年人要放开一些，潇洒一点，激发生命的活力，生活才有意义。</p>
<p>李连杰出身贫寒，因此从小自强、自立。因为练武术，成绩优异，经常获得冠军，因此工资在当时一直涨到88元，超过了领导工资甚至达到了教授的水平。他不到16岁便出访了40多个国家，甚至美国总统尼克松也要求他担任保镖。然而，少年得志的李连杰强调，无论取得什么样的成绩，都一直谨记要谦虚做人，只有这样，才能不断地取得成功。1982年，他因出演《少林寺》一举成名，获得了300万元的报酬。当时一般大学毕业生的工资是56元，300万这个天文数字般的大笔报酬，李连杰却一分都没剩全部上缴了。一夜成名后的他，继续领着每天3元钱的补助。有人问这是为什么？李连杰说：“我是国家培养出来的，国家在我身上花了无数的心血。自然，这笔钱不管多少都应该给投资人。”就是拥有这种“少要稳”的精神，李连杰一步步走来，奠定了今日的成功。</p>
<p>如今，他已近天命，依旧活力四射像个顽童般谈吐诙谐。“壹基金”的成功，是否就是“老要张狂”的见证？</p>
<p>柔弱胜刚强，圆融胜偏执</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>舌存常见齿亡，刚强终不胜柔弱；户①朽未闻枢②蠹③，偏执岂能及圆融。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①户：单扇门。</p>
<p>②枢：门轴。</p>
<p>③蠹（dù）：蛀蚀。宋·罗大经《鹤林玉露补遗》：“是勤可以远淫辟地，户枢不蠹，流水不腐。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>永远都是柔软的舌头还在而坚硬的牙齿却已经脱落，可见刚强终究胜不过柔弱；往往门板腐烂了，而经常转动的门轴却从未被蛀蚀，如此看来偏颇固执怎么也及不上左右逢源、宛转圆通。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>刚，往往性脆，脆则易折断；柔，则有韧的一面，则相对长久。由此可见，一味执拗不知变通是无法长久的。这是道家老子“柔弱不争”思想的阐释，“柔弱不争”思想既来自于老子对事物发展规律的认识，也源于对社会人生的洞察和体悟，意在引导人们以柔克刚，以独特的取胜之道和全性保身的生存处世之道有效调节个人关系、个人与社会关系。</p>
<p>福来不必喜，祸来不必忧</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天欲祸人，必先以微福骄之①，所以福来不必喜，要看他会受；天欲福人，必先以微祸儆之②，所以祸来不必忧，要看他会救。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①骄之：使他起骄傲之心。</p>
<p>②儆之：使他警惕小心。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>上天要降灾祸在一个人身上时，一定会先给些许的福分滋长他的骄傲之心，所以福运来了不要高兴得太早，要看自身是否懂得接受。上天要降福运在一个人身上时，一定会先给些许的灾祸来使他警惕小心、稍做惩戒，所以灾祸来了也不要太过忧虑，要看自身是否会自救。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>老子云：“祸兮福之所倚，福兮祸之所伏。”正是揭示天道变化的常理。天道的变化总是祸福相依，祸事降临不必惊慌，要善于自救，得到福分不必得意，要善于承受。人生没有永久的福分，也没有永久的祸事，失意与得意总是交相而来的，有福时要居安思危，有祸时要摆脱厄运。</p>

<p>生活在非洲大草原奥兰伯河东岸的羚羊之所以强健是因为在它们附近生活着一个狼群，而西岸的羚羊之所以弱小，是因为缺少这么一群天敌。没有天敌的动物往往最先灭绝，有天敌的动物则会逐渐繁衍壮大。</p>
<p>自古以来，数不清的先贤事迹也在为今人树立危机意识。吴王夫差被胜利冲昏头脑，当骄奢淫逸成为他的生活方式，当“遍江南独我尊，气凌空将湖海吞”被当作他的骄傲，他已无暇接纳伍子胥的进谏直言，早把“居安思危”抛到九霄云外。相反，勾践的屈辱求和，卑身事吴方使其破釜沉舟，反败为胜。即便后来回到越国，勾践依旧撤下锦绣被，睡在柴垛上，每顿饭前都要尝一口悬在床头的苦胆，用以铭记曾经的亡国之痛、石室之辱。经过“十年生聚，十年教训”，他终于守得云开见月明。夫差、勾践的典故正是“天欲祸人，必先以微福骄之；天欲福人，必先以微祸儆之”真谛的诠释。</p>
<p>贫贱难用情，富贵难好礼</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>贫贱所难，不难在砥节①，而难在用情；富贵所难，不难在推恩②，而难在好礼③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①砥（dǐ）节：磨练节操。</p>
<p>②推恩：施恩惠给人。</p>
<p>③好礼：遵循礼法，按礼法行使事。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>身处贫贱时难以做到的事，不是难在磨砺自己的节操，而是难在施予感情；身处富贵时难以做到的事，不是难在广施恩德，而是难在按礼行事。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>处在贫贱地位的人，保持节操、磨炼气节固然不是一件容易的事情，可是更难的是如何调度自己的感情，如何表达自己。</p>
<p>正像宗白华先生所说的那样：“深于情者，不仅对宇宙人生体会到至深的无名的哀感，扩而充之，可以成为耶稣、释迦的悲天悯人；就是快乐的体验也是深入肺腑，惊心动魄；浅俗薄情的人，不仅不能深哀，且不知所谓真乐。”做到这一点需要阔达的气度。处贫贱不易，修炼这种气度更难。身为富贵的人及时向需要帮助的人伸出援手相对容易一些，比广施恩惠艰难的是怎么能够尊重施惠对象，这需要的也是一种气度，一种并不把自己的富贵当成可以炫耀资本的豁达气度。</p>
<p>晋国士鞅投奔秦国，秦伯问士鞅说：“晋大夫哪一家会先灭亡？”士鞅说：“大概是栾氏吧。”秦伯说：“因为他奢侈吗？”士鞅说：“是的。栾黡已经奢侈得太过分了，但一时还不会灭亡，灭亡应该会在他儿子栾盈手上吧！”秦伯问：“何以见得？”士鞅说：“栾黡的父亲栾书，生前对人民有恩泽，这就像当年召公有恩于人民，人民连他生前所种的甘棠树都爱护有加，何况是他的亲生儿子？所以尽管栾黡不成材，人民还不忍心背弃。等到栾黡一死，他的儿子栾盈不能施恩给人民，武子遗留下的恩泽又差不多消磨殆尽了，加上对栾黡的怨恨记忆犹新，所以我认为栾氏将在栾盈手中灭亡。”秦伯认为他的言论很有远见。</p>
<p>瑰奇多惹祸，寻常享民福</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>异宝奇琛①，倶是必争之器；瑰节琦行②，多冒不祥之名。总不若寻常历履，易简行藏③，可以完天地浑噩之真，享民物和平之福。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①琛：珍宝。</p>
<p>②瑰节琦行：珍奇宝贵的操守与德行。瑰，珍奇、次于玉的石头。琦，美玉、珍奇。</p>
<p>③易简行藏：平易简约的行止。行藏，据《论语•述而》：“子谓颜渊曰：‘用之则行，舍之则藏，唯吾与尔有是夫！’”因此行藏多指出处或行止。易简，平易简约。平易简约的行止。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>奇珍异宝，都是惹起人们纷争的器物；瑰奇不寻常的品行节操，多数会招来不好的名声。总比不上平常的经历与平和简单的行止，可以使人保全天地赋予的浑厚纯朴的本质，享受民物和平的福气。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>晋国想要攻打虞国，担心虢国会救虞国，如果攻打虢国的话，虞国又会去救虢国。晋献公为此烦恼，大夫献计说：“虞国的国君性情贪婪，酷爱宝物。您可以把好马与璧玉送给他，向他借路去攻打虢国。”晋国使者到虞国拜见虞君，献上宝物，阐明要借道的意思。宫之奇劝诫虞君说：“唇亡齿寒，虢国和虞国互相依赖，虢国灭亡了，我们也就会处于危险之中了。”虞国国君看到宝物十分喜爱，于是不听从宫之奇的劝诫。晋国消灭虢国之后，果然返回来攻打虞国，把虞国也消灭了。虞国国君把晋国送的宝马与璧玉都还给了晋国。虞国的国君因为贪图珍奇异宝，最终使自己的国家被消灭。</p>
<p>宋太宗拒绝州郡献奇禽异兽。他说：“国家之祥瑞在于宇内安宁，民风淳朴，珍奇异兽，何益于事。”他曾把管库所藏外国进贡之香料宝货，设公卖局出售民间。他甚至把大内藏库中金银器皿都令销熔以作他用。有人说：“其中有精巧者，可留作后用。”他说：“你等以奇巧为贵，我以慈俭为宝。”喜欢奇珍异宝容易为自己惹来争端，使自己的品行节操瑰奇怪异，很容易为自己招来祸患。所以与其惊奇喜异，不如保持纯朴平常更能使人享受长久的和平与福气。</p>
<p>眼前田地宽，身后惠泽长</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>面前的田地①要放得宽，使人无不平之叹②；身后的惠泽要流得长，使人有不匮之思③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①田地：心胸。</p>
<p>②不平之叹：对不平之事发出的感叹。</p>
<p>③不匮之思：比喻永恒的恩泽。匮，缺乏。《诗经•大雅》篇：“孝子不匮，永锡尔类。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人应该把眼前待人处事的态度放得宽厚些，只有如此才不会致使身边的人发出不平的牢骚；对于死后遗留给子孙与后人的恩泽，则应该把眼光放得长远些，这样才会使子孙后代永远怀念。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>“人死留名，豹死留皮”，然而人生于世，如幻如梦，如白驹过隙，不过是一场过眼烟云。为人，善人也好，恶人也罢，即便是贤者、患者，或长幼，或内外，都应心存一份包容之心，多做好事，这样才会遗爱人间为人永远怀念。</p>
<p>严公想在城中营建一座大宅，草图大致已规划完成，唯独隔邻的民宅有根梁柱突出，使得严公的新宅不够方正。隔壁民宅的主人是对卖酸酒的夫妇，这栋房子是他们世代的祖产。相府的工头曾出高价，请屋主出让屋舍，不料遭到屋主悍然拒绝。工头非常生气，将此事禀告严公。严公说：“不碍事，你先盖房子的其他三面。”</p>
<p>开工后，严公命府中每日所需的酸酒都向隔壁的主人购买，并且每次事先付款。这对夫妻平日生意清淡，生活拮据，每天的收入不足糊口，严公知道后，便为他们介绍买主，从此生意好转，不久就因人手不足而招募工人，生意愈做愈大，屋内到处堆放米大谷、豆类，石缸的数目也成倍数增加，屋内的空间自然益显狭窄。</p>
<p>这对夫妇感激严公的恩德，对自己当初悍然的拒绝感到惭愧，于是自动写下契据将屋舍献给严公，严公用城中其他的屋舍与他交换，由于屋主换得一间较大的屋舍，非常高兴，不多久就搬家了。</p>
<p>民宅的主人没有向令人生畏的权势屈服，唯独软化于恩德的施与，正是“使人无不平之叹，使人有不匮之思”的精妙之处啊！</p>
<p>富贵知贫贱，少壮念衰老</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>处富贵之地，要知贫贱的痛痒①；当少壮之时，须念衰老的辛酸。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①痛痒：比喻痛苦。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当处在富贵的环境中时，要知道贫贱的痛苦滋味；当年轻力壮的时候，要想到年老体衰时候的辛酸滋味。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>富贵和贫穷是相互转化的，拥有了富贵的人如果不能勤奋谨慎，也许很快就会失去富贵。年轻人朝气蓬勃，精力无限，似乎拥有很多时间。实际上每一个人拥有的时间与精力都是有限的，如果不能好好地加以利用，当年老体衰的时候就会后悔莫及。有不少人没有获得富贵的时候，谨慎小心、勤勤恳恳。一旦获得富贵，就把从前的苦难都抛在脑后，变得骄傲奢侈起来，这样很快又会失去富贵。</p>
<p>美国人比尔•盖茨非常有钱，他连续多年一直被评为世界首富。虽然非常有钱，盖茨在花钱的时候，却不是毫不计较。盖茨在为慈善事业捐款的时候，不吝惜钱。但是有的时候他也比较小气，有一次他和朋友去停车，贵宾车位贵，普通车位便宜。因为贵宾车位那里比较空，朋友建议停到那里。盖茨摇头，他嫌贵宾车位太贵，坚持把车停在了普通车位那边。拥有富贵要知道贫贱的滋味，这样能使人珍惜自己拥有的幸福，从而留住富贵。年轻力壮的时候，珍惜光阴。想到有一天自己会变老，能促使自己更珍惜时光，抓住时间做一些有价值的事情。等到年华老去的那一天，不至于为浪费大好时光而后悔。</p>
<p>爱重反为仇，薄极反成喜</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>千金难结一时之欢，一饭竟致终身之感①。盖爱重反为仇，薄极反成喜也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①一饭竟致终身之感：据《史记•淮阴侯列传》中记载，韩信年少之时，家中贫寒，钓于城下，有漂母见他饥饿，就给他饭吃。后来韩信成就一番事业，请来漂母，赠送她千金以示感谢。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>送他人千两黄金也难以讨他人一时的欢心，而请他人吃一顿饭竟然能够换来一辈子的感激。可见过分的宠爱反而会转化成仇恨，小恩惠反而能使他人欢喜。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人与人之间相处，有时候别人送他很贵重的礼物，收到礼物的人也不一定会觉得多么高兴；相反一点小小的恩惠他也许会牢牢记在心中。正如韩信，贫寒之时，漂母请他吃顿饭，他就一直牢牢记在心上。显贵之后，以千金报答漂母。而一些达官显贵，巴结他们的人送金银玉石、奇珍异宝给他们，收到巨额礼物的显贵们如何高兴姑且不论，但显而易见的是他们对这些送礼人未必会有多么深厚的感激之情，更不见得会把这些送礼人放在心上。正所谓“爱重反为仇，薄极反成喜也”，这样的现象在生活中很常见。</p>
<p>小林很喜欢种花，她家的阳台上摆了许多花。她有一盆昙花，就快开花了，请朋友小李去她家观赏昙花。小李一边等着昙花开放，一边欣赏其他的花。她注意到有一种如小星星一般的黄花，开得蓬蓬勃勃，每个花盆里都有。朋友问小林这是什么花，小林说她也不知道这花叫什么名。平时小林根本不在意它，可这小黄花热情无限，几乎什么时候都在开花，自生自灭还活得热热闹闹。小李感叹偶尔开花的如此受重视，一年四季常开不败的花反而不被珍惜。</p>
<p>这种现象在家人相处之间也常见到。家人之间，因为至亲，所以有时会理所当然接受对方付出，想不到珍惜，一点点瑕疵都不能容忍，而他人的一点关怀，出于意外，往往会放在心上。有一个女孩正处于青春期，常和母亲吵架。这一天，她又和母亲大吵一架，一怒之下，她转身离开家。她在街上漫无目的到处走，走累了肚子也感觉很饿。看到前面有一个小吃摊，她打算去买点东西吃。小吃摊的主人是一个中年妇女，看上去与女孩母亲的年龄差不多。女孩说：“来一碗牛肉面。”牛肉面端上来了，热气腾腾，里面有香菜，白萝卜与牛肉都切成非常薄的片，味道很好。吃过面条，女孩心情平静了许多。她问摊主：“多少钱？”打算结账走人。摊主说：“五块钱。”女孩一摸自己的衣兜，顿时呆住了。她出门时随便捞起一件外套穿，她的钱包放在另一件外套里。女孩很窘迫，不知道怎么和摊主说自己没带钱。摊主看出女孩的窘迫，就说：“不用找了，一碗面条就算了吧，算我请你吃的。”女孩感激得落泪，说：“我们不认识，你对我都这么好。我妈妈只会骂我。”摊主愣了下，随后笑着说：“我也有你这样大的一个女儿，大概她也觉得我经常骂她吧。我只不过请你吃一碗面，你就觉得我对你好。你想想你妈妈为你做过多少顿饭！”</p>
<p>耳不留是非，心不着物我</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>耳根①如风谷传声，过而不留，则是非倶谢；心境如月池浸色②，空而不着，则物我两忘。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①耳根：六根之一。佛家以眼、耳、鼻、舌、身、意为六根。</p>
<p>②月池浸色：月亮在水中的倒影所映出的月色。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>耳根假如像大风吹过山谷一样，经一阵呼啸之后什么也没有，这样所有的流言蜚语就不会起到作用；心灵假如能像月亮在水中的倒影所映出的月色那般，月亮不在水中，水中就没有月亮，当月亮被云彩遮掩，水仍是水，月还是月，人若能达到这种境界，心中自然也就能一片光明而无外物和自我之分了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>佛教所说的六根清净，不单是指耳不听恶声，也包括心不想恶事，眼、耳、鼻、舌、身、意六者都要不留任何印象才行。而物我两忘是使物我相对关系不复存在，这时绝对境界就自然可以出现。可见想要提高人生境界必须除去感官的诱惑，六根清净，四大皆空。按现代人的看法，绝对的境界即人的感官不可能一点不受外物的感染，否则何以判断是否反映外物了呢？但提高自身的修养，加强意志锻炼，控制住自己的种种欲望，排除私心杂念，建立高尚的精神境界却是完全可能的。</p>
<p>有一次，一位叫貉稽的仕者访问孟子。貉稽告诉孟子，自己总是被人说得很坏。孟子回答他说：“别管它就是了，世界上就是有人喜欢造谣中伤，到处散播谣言。《诗经》上说：‘忧心忡忡排遣不了，小人对我又恨又恼。’孔子就是这样的人。”又说：“‘不消除别人的怨恨，也不丧失自己的名声。’说的就是像文王这样的人。”</p>
<p>面对飞短流长，我们不该用别人的是非之论、口无遮拦来使自己烦恼。造谣者造谣生事不需要证据，要的只是谣言带来的影响和效果。而那些爱传流言道是非的人，本就是小人。小人终归是小人，无法堵住悠悠众口，那我们不如轻视谣言，不把谣言当回事，让谣言止于智者。</p>
<p>忧勤与淡泊，勿太苦与枯</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>忧勤①是美德，太古则无以适性怡情②；淡泊是高风③，太枯④则无以济人利物。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①忧勤：绞尽脑汁用体力去做事。</p>
<p>②适性怡情：使心情愉快精神爽朗。</p>
<p>③高风：高尚的情操或高风亮节。</p>
<p>④枯：已经丧失生机的树木，这里指不近人情的含意。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>用心尽力去做事本来是一种很好的品德，但是过于认真而使心力交瘁，使精神得不到调剂就会失去生活乐趣；把功名利禄看得很淡本来是一种高尚的情操，但是过分清心寡欲，对社会大众就不会做出什么贡献了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>所谓“明月清风不要钱”，人若能有这淡泊名利的思想，自然就会做到“富贵于我如浮云”，心境自然也就清凉，如此无忧无虑该是何等飘逸。不过什么事都不要走极端，假如过分轻视世间的功名利禄，就会被人误会缺乏匡世救人的精神，这时就会被社会大众所唾弃。佛家说：“菩提本无树，明镜亦非台，本来无一物，何处惹尘埃。”可见人虽然对于分内之事应全力以赴，但是对于与生俱来的本然之性也必须善加维持，假如遇事做得太苦就失去了生活乐趣。</p>
<p>儒家所说的“过犹不及”就是指此而言，儒家主张中庸之道，主张任何事物都要维持均衡状态。孔子说：中庸这种道德，是最高的境界。为人处世，不要过分，也不要不及，过分与不及，都会偏离目标，不能中的。</p>
<p>《礼记•中庸》说：国家天下可使达到人人均平富裕（智与能），高官厚禄可以断然辞让（仁），锋利的刀刃可以毅然相向（勇），智仁勇俱全，但要做到中庸，还是“不可能”。中庸是儒家心目中的妙境，是艺术，是至高至美的理想，是需要人时时警醒、不懈努力去追求的。</p>
<p>燥寡凝滞者，功业福祉难</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>燥性者火炽，遇物则焚；寡思者冰清，逢物必杀；凝滞固执①者，如死水腐木，生机已绝。倶难建功业而延福祉②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①凝滞固执：形容人顽固不化，非常固执古板。凝滞，停留不动。</p>
<p>②福祉：幸福，利益。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>性情急躁的人好比烈火一般炽热，和他接触的人都会被他的热情灼伤；刻薄寡恩无情无义的人如同冰雪一般冷酷，和他接触的人只要碰到他都会遭到残害；头脑顽固而呆板的人像一潭死水又像一棵朽木，了无生机。这些人都不是能够建大功、立大业，能为人类社会造福的人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>性情暴躁者，往往有勇无谋，行事匆匆，喜好逞强示勇，图一时痛快，总之是有血性无灵性。薄情寡义者，冷静有余，冷酷有加，却不善于爱惜人、信任人，久而久之终成孤家寡人。将人当做一块抹布，用完就甩，是薄情寡义者的主要性格特征。头脑僵化者，遇事不知灵活变通，不知与时倶进，在错误的方向上越走越远，却每每以有志者事竟成来聊以自慰。性格决定命运。这三种不良性格者，往往自毁而又毁人，当然难建功业而延福祉了。所以，每一种性格的人，都应该吸取相反性格的优点，这样才能使自己趋于完善。</p>
<p>有一对生活富有的夫妻，他们从来不和别人交往，为人又刻薄又吝啬。从来没有人从他们家成功借到过东西，就是对自己家里人也同样如此。家里唯一的儿子在外经商，由于管理不善，赔得血本无归。最后，只能选择回家缓缓失败的受伤心灵，等攒点钱后再接着出去闯荡。没成想到等他回到家里后，不仅没有得到父母的安慰，反而面对的是父母的冷若冰霜和冷嘲热讽。就连吃饭的时候，他们也是一边说一些伤他自尊心的话，一边不是摔碗碟就是摔筷子。实在没有办法在家里呆下去了，当天半夜，他背起行李离开了家。头出门，刚好碰到起夜的父亲，这位父亲不仅没有说挽留的话，就是让儿子天亮后再走的话都没有说。这以后，儿子和父母之间就断了一切联系。</p>
<p>山水扇面</p>
<p>出世篇</p>
<p>“人生一世，草木一秋。”匆匆忙忙的短暂，小草一般由青而黄。所有的人，上自帝王显贵，下至黎民苍生，都是这舞台的演员和看客。常言浮生若梦，过去把这话是当做消极的思想来批判的。其实，谁都明白，人生到底是一出悲剧。无论是天才还是愚人，到头来都摆脱不了一个毫无二致的结局。有了这样的洞察，人们就会在苍茫的悲凉中，获得某种顿悟。</p>
<p>具体看，人活着要谋生，要做事，不论是为自己，还是为社会，都来不得半点虚妄。太阳每日升起，每日落下，一个人的一生能看到几次日出日落的景致？因此要珍惜，绝不虚度光阴。春花秋月，赏心乐事；酷暑严冬，勤勉苦辛。每日都过得充实、有意义，益于人，也益于自己。把眼前做的每一件事，都看成盛大的庆典，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。不悲观，不厌世，步伐坚定地向前走。明知愈走愈接近那谁也无法逃避的终点，却始终是坚定地前行。</p>
<p>这样的人生，便是摆脱了大悲苦而拥有大欢喜的人生。</p>
<p>看个色身破，认个法身真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>古人闲适处，今人却忙过了一生；古人实受处，今人又虚度了一世。总是耽空逐妄①，看个色身不破②，认个法身不真③耳。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①耽空逐妄：追求虚妄，沉溺在空洞的不切实际当中。</p>
<p>②看个色身不破：看不破红尘俗世。色身，肉身。</p>
<p>③认个法身不真：看不真切佛之法身，指参不透佛理，成不了正果。法身，佛之真身为法身。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>古人闲适自在，现在的人却在忙忙碌碌中度过了一生；古人享受人生乐趣，现在的人却虚度了人生。人们总是追逐功名利禄等虚妄的东西，看不破肉身，参不透人生真谛。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>闲适人生是自我享受、自我陶醉的一种方式。闲适所追求的不过是人心理的一种彻底的放松，身心极度的和谐，生活舒服闲散。从这个意义讲，闲适是和紧张、压力、复杂和焦虑相对的。古人的闲适，正是陶渊明怡然自得的“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”，古人的实受，也正是关汉卿高唱的“南亩耕，东山卧。世态人情经历多。闲将往事思量过，贤的是他，愚的是我，争什么！”而看不开的现代人啊，却把古人看重、早就享受过的那些重要的东西置之度外，殚精竭虑地追名逐利。</p>
<p>闲适，不在天高地广。养一缸鱼，随意而观，看它们前后追逐，左右嬉戏，不由得心有所动，也是一种境界；品茶，酌酒，哼京调，搓麻将，猜谜语，下棋，养鸟，看戏，午睡，深呼吸，玩字画等等，无不充满着生活的情趣和快乐。</p>
<p>闲适不等于无聊或者没事找事，按照林语堂的说法，闲适是中国人性灵的一种表现。换句话说，真正的闲适人生来自于人心智的一种艺术活动，是一种人生品位。有了美的性灵，有了高雅的品位，才能在各种生活中找着风韵，体验到雅致、柔和和亲呢，才能享受闲适的快乐。</p>

<p>万物原一辙，万物本一体</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>万境一辙，原无地著个穷通①；万物一体，原无处分个彼我。世人迷真逐妄②，乃向坦途上自设一坷坎，从空洞中自筑一藩篱③。良足④慨哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①穷通：贫困与显达。</p>
<p>②迷真逐妄：对真理迷惑不清，对虚妄之说追逐执著。</p>
<p>③藩篱：篱笆墙。</p>
<p>④良足：很值得。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>天下各种境界都同出一辙，可是人们却要在本来没有贫困与显达的地方显示出贫困与显达来；世上各种事物皆浑然一体，可是人们却要在本来没有你我之分的地方分别出你与我来。世人迷失真理而追逐虚妄，实是在平坦的大道上为自己设下了一个坎坷，在空旷无遮拦的地方为自己筑起了一片篱笆，确实是令人感慨啊！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人怕没有自知之明，也怕自设藩篱。追求幸福原本无可厚非，殊不知，有多少人，有时候放着现成的福不知道去享，却费尽心力奔波劳顿，就好比是在原本平坦的大路上平白无故地设置了难以逾越的障碍物，这实在是令人感慨万端的事情。所以，在准备进行艰苦卓绝的奋斗的时候，一定要问问自己到底要的是什么，然后也别急着行动，不妨静下心来看一看，自己距离想要的到底有多远，然后再忙不迟。</p>
<p>有时候人们冲破了艰难险阻，经历了千辛万苦，终于把黑暗踩在脚下，迎来了光明的曙光，却因为极度得意忘形，又重新跌入黑暗的境地。得意忘形，使人丧失了最起码的谦虚，头脑发热，做事情往往没有逻辑，只凭一时的感觉。</p>
<p>有一个神话故事，父子俩被囚禁在一个山峰的高塔中，他们为了逃走，把鸟儿停驻高塔时所脱落的羽毛用蜡粘合在一起，做了两对巨大的翅膀，想借此飞出高塔。当他们飞出高塔的时候，儿子觉得在天空遨游的感觉太美了，十分得意，便不顾父亲的劝告，越飞越高，结果由于太接近太阳了，蜡开始融化，儿子因此跌入深渊。</p>
<p>人精爽通天，天威命寓人</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>福善不在杳冥①，即在食息起居处牖②其衷；祸淫③不在幽渺，即在动静语默④间夺其魄。可见人之精爽⑤常通于天，天之威命⑥即寓于人，天人岂相远哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①杳冥：遥远看不见的地方。</p>
<p>②牖（yǒu）：窗户，此处喻指显露、暴露。</p>
<p>③祸淫：祸害和邪恶。幽渺：阴暗渺茫的地方。</p>
<p>④动静语默：指人的行动、静止、言语、沉默四种行为。</p>
<p>⑤精爽：精神，灵魂。</p>
<p>⑥威命：尊严。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>上天赐给人的福气与善良，不在遥远而看不见的地方，就在日常的饮食起居的地方启迪人们的心灵，使其行善而得福；上天降给人的祸害与淫邪，不在阴暗渺茫的地方，就在平常的行动或休息、说话或沉默中间夺去人们的魂魄，使其走向淫邪而招祸。由此可见，只要人的精神常常与上天相通，上天的意旨便能寄寓在人们的心中，这样上天与人难道相去会遥远吗？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的祸福不是取决于“天”，而是取决于自身的行为举止，具体到日常的饮食起居。因而必须强调的是个人自身的道德审视，以及自身行为的量变质变规律。一个人在成名、成功的时候，如非平素具有“宠辱不惊”的真修养，一旦得意，便会欣喜若狂，甚至有所谓得意忘形者。</p>
<p>前清的时候，民间相传一则笑话。有一个老童生，每次考试不中，但年纪已经步入中年了，这一次正好与儿子同科应考。到了放榜的一天，儿子看榜回来，知道已经被录取，赶快回家报喜。他的父亲正好关在房里洗澡。儿子敲门大叫说：“父亲，我已考取了！”老子在房里一听，便大声呵斥说：“考取一个秀才，算得了什么，这样沉不住气，大呼小叫！”儿了一听，吓得不敢大叫，便轻轻地说：“父亲，你也考取了！”老子一听，便打开房门，一冲而出，大声呵斥说：“你为什么不先说。”他忘了自己光着身子，连衣裤都还没穿呢！这便是“宠为下，得之若惊，失之若惊”的一个写照。</p>
<p>一个人，当凭自己的努力、实干，靠自己的聪明才智获得了应得的荣誉、奖赏、爱戴、夸耀时，应该保持清醒的头脑，有自知之明，切莫受宠若惊，飘飘然，自觉豪光万道，所谓“给点光亮就灿烂”。而聪明的人对一切事物的态度是无可无不可，宠辱不惊，当如古人阮籍所说“布衣可终身，宠禄岂足赖”，一切都不过是过眼烟云，荣誉已成为过去时，不值得夸耀，更不足以留恋。“宠辱不惊”，那种欣喜愉悦的心境是发自肺腑的，淋漓尽致的，心灵是宁静安逸的；而“得之若惊，失之若惊”，“唯唯诺诺”的人其心境永远处于风雨飘摇之中。</p>

<p>作人无甚高远的事业，摆脱得俗情①便入名流；为学无甚增益②的工夫，减除得物累③，便臻圣境④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①俗情：世俗之人追逐利欲的意念。</p>
<p>②增益：增加，积累。</p>
<p>③物累：心遭受到外物等欲望的干扰。</p>
<p>④臻圣境（zhēn）：达到至高无上的境界。臻，达到。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>做人不一定非要成就一番大事业，只要能摆脱对世俗功名利禄的欲望，便可以跻身于名流；要想求到很高深的学问，也没有什么特别的秘诀，只要能排除外界的诱惑，保持恬淡寡欲的心智，便能够达到超凡入圣的境界了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>现代生活节奏越来越快，太多的诱惑，太多的欲望，产生了太多的压力，太多的痛苦，人人身心疲惫。就名利而言，能够得到而不去拼命争取，已经拥有而不看得过重，这是一种高雅的超脱。人的一生，名利也好，富贵也好，终生拼搏也好，逍遥自在也罢，都是一种对人生的抉择。但是需要把握住一定的衡量标准来解释究竟什么是自己满意的充实和幸福。人生百态，法无定法，理无定理，究竟什么叫高远，怎样是名流，大抵每个人都有自己的一套标准。但摆脱名利束缚能使人不拘于外物，不以物喜，不以物悲，进退升迁皆能安然处之，以清醒的心智和从容的步履走过岁月，这便是人生的至高境界。</p>
<p>君子居常好，不浓亦不枯</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>念头浓①者自待厚，待人亦厚，处处皆厚；念头淡②者自待薄，待人亦薄，事事皆保。故君子居常③嗜好，不可太浓艳④，亦不宜太枯寂⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①念头浓：心里的想法宽厚。念头，想法、动机。</p>
<p>②淡：薄、浅。</p>
<p>③居常：日常生活。</p>
<p>④浓艳：浓厚，这里指奢侈无度。</p>
<p>⑤枯寂：寂寞到极点，这里指吝啬。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个心里想法深厚的人，不但要求自己的生活富足，而且对待别人也要讲究丰足，因此他凡事都要讲究气派豪华；一个欲念淡薄的人，不但自己过着平淡的生活，对待别人也很淡薄，因此他凡事都表现得冷漠无情。所以一个真正有修养的人，日常生活的喜好，既不过分讲究气派、奢侈无度，也不能过分吝啬刻薄。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人贵知足，过与不及，都非立身之道。处世待人应该是辨证的。一个人在日常生活中，宽厚与淡泊之间必须拿准尺度，因为宽厚过度就流于奢侈，淡泊过度就流于吝啬。每个人都有七情六欲，现实中的是是非非需要我们去判断，待人一定要适中，做人也才合群受敬。浪费无度足以败身，刻薄寡恩必将负人，成为人们失败的两个因素。所以每个人都应当遵守的生活原则是，既不要太浓艳而奢侈，也不要太淡薄而寡恩。</p>
<p>人类对金鱼一贯的要求是美，而金鱼的捕食能力却被作为美的代价退化殆尽。人类把食物精工细制得可口至极，成为一种其无力抗拒的诱惑，于是不会摇头的金鱼吃啊吃，直到连同食物一起沉至水底。贪得无厌成为金鱼最常见的一种死因。</p>
<p>哀公曾问：“什么样的人是庸人呢？”孔子回答说：“所谓庸人，口里讲不出美好的语言，思想上不懂得谦虚知足，不懂得选取贤良善美的人作为自己的依靠，用来替自己解脱忧愁。行动时不知道追求的是什么，休息时不知道定准是什么，虽然整天对各种事物东挑西选，但不知道最重要的是什么，与物迁徙，随波逐流，不知道何处是自己的归宿，以眼耳鼻口身等的五官的享受为主宰，思想也随之变坏，如果是这样，就可以称之为庸人了。”</p>
<p>荀子在《儒效》中也曾说：人的等类是：思想上没有去掉私心杂念，却希望别人说他公正；行动上没有去掉龌龊卑鄙，却希望别人说他品德善良；愚昧无知，却希望别人说他知识渊博，这不过是一些芸芸众生罢了。思想上抑制私心杂念，然后才能一心为公；行动上抑制放纵的性情，然后才能使品德善良；有智慧而又好问，然后才能多才多艺。能够做到公正、善良又有一定的才干，就可以叫做小儒了。思想上习惯于公正，行动上习惯于善良，智慧能通晓各类事务的基本原则，这样，就可以叫做大儒了。</p>
<p>事来心始现，事去心随空</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>风来疏竹①，风过而竹不留声；雁渡寒潭，雁去而潭不留影②。故君子事来心始现③，事去而心随空④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①风来疏竹：风吹过竹丛，使竹叶分开。</p>
<p>②留影：雁飞过寒潭而影子仍在潭上。</p>
<p>③心始现：本心才显露出来。</p>
<p>④空：平静。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当轻风过吹吹过稀疏的竹林间，竹林里会发出沙沙的声音，可是当风吹过去之后，竹林中并不会留下声音而仍旧归于寂静；当大雁飞过，寒潭固然会倒映出雁影，但是大雁飞过后，清澈的水面依旧是一片晶莹并没有留下雁影。由此可见，一个有品德的君子，当事情来临时他的本性才会显现出来，事情结束后，他的本性也就恢复了原来的平静。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>苏东坡有诗云：人生到处知何似，应似飞鸿踏雪泥。雪上偶然留指爪，鸿飞哪复计东西。一个修养好的人，善于调节自己的心理状态，使自己的心理总是处于平衡的状态之中，这样才能够使一个人永远保持平静的心情。就像一阵轻风吹过稀疏的竹林间，竹林里会发出沙沙的声音，可是当风吹过去之后，竹林中并不会留下声音而仍旧归于寂静；当大雁飞过，寒潭固然会倒映出雁影，但是大雁飞过后，清澈的水面依旧是一片晶莹并没有留下雁影。意思是说虽然我们做了一些事情，但是当事情过去了以后，我们的心情也就随之空阔明净了，而不是对过去的事情念念不忘。</p>
<p>苏东坡</p>
<p>机里又藏机，智巧何足恃</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鱼网之设①，鸿②罹③其中；螳螂之贪，雀又乘其后④。机里藏机，变外生变，智巧何足恃哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①鱼网之设，鸿则罹其中：见《诗经•邶风•新台》篇。</p>
<p>②鸿：大雁。</p>
<p>③罹：遭，碰上。多指遭受不幸。</p>
<p>④螳螂之贪，雀又乘其后：见《说苑•正练》篇：“园中有树，其上有蝉，蝉高居悲鸣饮露，不知螳螂在其后也，螳螂委身曲欲取蝉，而不知黄雀在其傍也。”比喻人们只看到眼前利益忽略其后隐藏的灾祸。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>本来是为捕鱼设置的网，不料却使大雁落入网中；贪婪的螳螂只想吃掉前面的蝉，谁知道身后还有一只想要吃掉它的黄雀。天地之间机巧之中还有机巧，变化之外还有变化，人的智谋巧计又怎么能靠得住呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>天地之间，变化万端。人用尽聪明机巧，也比不过天地的机巧。对于人来说，不可预知与把握的事情非常多，很多时候费尽心思仍旧一无所得。有时候人们以为自己能够经过努力实现目标，却有可能像是“螳螂捕蝉，黄雀在后”那样，暗中隐藏的危险不知道什么时候就会到来。有些时候则有可能是“有心栽花花不开，无心插柳柳成荫”，苦苦追求的目标始终不能实现，无意中做的事情却带来意料之外的收获。</p>
<p>智巧何足恃，是说那些机巧算计不可取，没有否定人的主观能动性的发挥具有积极作用。人不会任由大自然摆布，人们能够探索大自然的奥秘，发现自然背后隐藏的规律。认识了世界中存在的各种规律，可以使人们更好地利用这些规律，使世界的发展朝着有利于人类社会的方向前进。智巧何足恃，说明使心机算计别人，用各种计谋聪明来为自己谋取非分利益，最终必然落得失败的下场。一个人再能算计，也算计不过天地。正所谓“机关算尽太聪明，反算了卿卿性命”。所以与其使用机巧计谋还不如踏踏实实，放弃那些聪明机巧，这样做人反而能获得幸福。</p>
<p>唐朝李林甫深得唐玄宗信任，李林甫生前获得无数赏赐。良田美宅、花园别墅、珍奇异宝，数不胜数。李林甫娶了很多老婆，子女众多。他非常怕有人害他，常常睡不安稳。等到李林甫死后不久，杨国忠说他生前曾与人勾结想谋反，使李林甫被追夺官爵，财产被没收，家属都被发配。李林甫的棺材被挖出劈开，他下葬时穿的紫衣被脱去，口中含玉被人掏出，被草草安置在一口薄棺中重新埋葬。李林甫生前显赫，善用心计，却也保不住家人，不能免除被人开棺之祸。可见人之机巧，实在胜不过天地。所以与其使尽心机，不如顺其自然，保持自己的质朴本性。</p>
<p>知心体莹然，不失人本来</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>夸逞①功业，炫耀文章，皆是靠外物做人。不知心体莹然②，本来不失，即无寸功只字，亦自有堂堂正正做人处。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①夸逞：夸是自我吹嘘，言过其实，逞是强行显露。</p>
<p>②莹然：莹是指玉的颜色，洁白纯净。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>夸张自己的功劳业绩，炫耀自己的文章美妙，这都是靠外物来增加自身光彩博取他人赞美。却不知人人内心都有一块洁白晶莹的美玉，所以一个人只要不丧失人类原有的纯朴善良的本性，即使在一生之中没留下半点功勋伟业，没留下片纸只字的著作文章，也算是一个堂堂正正的人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子表扬学生子路说：穿一身破旧的棉袍子，和穿着华贵的裘皮的人站在一起，而丝毫不自惭形秽的，恐怕只有子路一个人吧！与此相反，那些立志很高而又为自己吃穿害羞的人，就不值一谈了。孟子说：“说大人则藐之。”曹植说：“左顾右盼，谓若无人，岂非君子之志哉！”而左思的诗说得更好：“贵者虽自贵，视之若尘埃；贱者不自贱，重之若千钧。”这告诉我们无论在什么人面前，要有礼，但不要自卑、胆怯。要对自己有信心，自己尊重自己，重视自己与别人平等的人格。这样，不仅能不自贱自羞，而且能对人不嫉妒、不巴结，堂堂正正地立于天地人群之间。</p>
<p>据说子路是“卞之野人”，从小在乡间长大。乡人只要不饥不寒，就不会因非分之想而弄出种种丑态来，加上在孔门所受的教育陶养，使他形成了自重自强的人格，这一点，对今天的我们，仍然具有很大的启示。</p>
<p>会得个中趣，破得眼前机</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>会①得个中趣，五湖②之烟月③，尽入寸里④；破得眼前机⑤，千古之英雄，尽归掌握⑥。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①会：领悟。</p>
<p>②五湖：古代关于五湖范围有多种说法，这里是泛指。</p>
<p>③烟月：大自然中的山川景色。</p>
<p>④寸里：心里。</p>
<p>⑤机：机运。</p>
<p>⑥掌握：指挥、控制，这里指交往、效法。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>现实世界中不论何事，只要能领悟其中的乐趣，那么五湖四海的山川美景，就等于全都纳入我的心中一样任我尽情享受；现实世界中不论任何道理，只要能看穿眼前的机运事理，那么所有古往今来的英雄豪杰就都会成为我的朋友，由我尽情交往任意效法。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>五湖极富烟霞风月景观，自古就是骚人墨客游赏的胜地。风景名胜必须具有风雅兴味的人才能领会其中真趣，而对俗不可耐的市井之辈就有如焚琴煮鹤。诗人杜甫游览名胜之后吟出“昔闻洞庭水，今上岳阳楼，吴楚东南坼，乾坤日月浮”的名句，孟浩然在欣赏完山光湖色之后咏出“八月湖水平，涵空混太清；气蒸云梦泽，波撼岳阳城”一诗。</p>
<p>不过，诗人要领会山水间的趣味，也不一定非要亲身到那个地方，亲眼看见那个地方的景色，在斗室之中也可以把天下的名胜大观，自由自在地赏玩观览。正所谓“俗人看景，山便是山，水便是水，与我了无关系。虽游尽三山五岳，一切仍在身外，略无所得。诗人看景，山便是我，我便是山，心气相沟通，情感相交汇。见松柏而自然生凛然之气，见杨柳则多妩媚之情。所有的山水都印在他的心灵上，闪烁在他的眼眸里，流露在他的谈吐中。这种人虽足不出户，而尽得山水之灵秀。”</p>
<p>哀公曾问什么样的人是圣人，孔子回答说：“所谓圣人，他的智慧通晓大道，顺应事物的变化而不会受到困窘，对各种事物的性情分辨得清清楚楚。所谓大道，就是一切事物变化形成的根本道理，所谓性情，就是判断是非决定取舍的内在根据。所以，圣人做事像天地那样广大，了解事物像日月那样明亮，统率万物像风雨滋润万物一样美好而精纯；他办事普通人不能模仿，如同上天主宰万物一样；他办事普通人不能解悟，如同百姓浅薄无知对自己身边的事也不能认识一样。如果这样，就可以称之为圣人了。”</p>
<p>肃杀存生意，可见天地心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>草木才零落，便露萌蘖①于根底；时序虽凝寒②，终回阳气③于灰管④；肃杀之气，生意存焉，即是可以见天地之心⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①萌蘖：旁出的新芽。</p>
<p>②凝寒：寒冷到结冰的地步，形容天气非常寒冷。凝，结冰。</p>
<p>③阳气：春天的温和之气。</p>
<p>④灰管：古代测气候变化的玉管，因以葭莩灰放在律管中而得名。</p>
<p>⑤心：本源。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>草木的枝叶刚刚飘零枯黄，就已在根的底部露出了新的芽；虽然处在寒气凝集的冬季，而春天的温和之气已在灰管中等待复出。在肃杀萧瑟的气候中，存在着使万物生长发育的生机，由此可见天地生育万物的本心。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>冬天来了，春天还会远吗？这是雪莱在《西风颂》中的激情展望。冬去春回，上天尚有生生之意，人活世上，时乖命舛时岂只绝路一条？王维也诗云：遥爱云木秀，初疑路不同。安知清流转，偶与前山通。人生路上永不言败，绝路尽处必是通途。</p>
<p>常言道：“有生必有死，有死必有生”，天地万物就是如此生生不息，所以古圣先贤才赞美说“天地之大德曰生”。而邵康节的诗更有：“冬至子之半，天心无改移；一阳初动处，万物未生时。”可见万物虽然没诞生，然而生生之机已经孕育其内了。在凋落枯萎之中尚存有生生之机，我们研究生物之理就不该徒重外表形式，应再进一步探求其中的真实内涵，如此就能体会出“以吾人数十年必死的生命，立国家亿万年不朽之根基”之理。</p>
<p>“客亦知夫水与月乎？逝者如斯，而未尝往也；盈虚者如彼，而卒莫消长也。”苏东坡《前赤壁赋》中的这段话，道出了生生之德，永不息止。</p>
<p>世事如棋局，不着是高手</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>世事如祺局，不着①的才是高手；人生似瓦盆，打破了方见真空②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①着：下棋。</p>
<p>②真空：佛家称超出一切色相意识的真实境界为真空。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>世间之事，犹若一盘棋局，只要有争斗，就会有输赢胜败，只有不着一子，与世无争，才是造诣高深的人；人生在世，就好像生活在一个封闭的瓦盆之中，追名逐利，忙碌终生，只有冲破这个蒙蔽人的本性的瓦盆，才能悟解人生的真谛，达到超凡入圣的境界。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>凡生活中人，总是容易给自己套上名利枷锁，以致禁锢了活跃的心灵，只看身边幽暗的谷底，不看远方叠翠的青山，处处事事围绕近身的名利周旋，把期望值定得越来越高，导致失望越来越大，一旦角逐失利，难望东山再起，便心灰意冷，慨叹人生如梦。</p>
<p>人生旅途是漫长的，在人生的岁月里，一个人不可能总是一帆风顺，万事如意。由于智商、能力、经历和处境的诸多不同，人们之间必然有着起伏、顺逆、穷达等诸多差别，大可不必为在名气、地位、权力上不如某同乡、某同学、某同事乃至其他某某人而心生迷茫和怅惘。我们需要的是把自己从纷乱的名利堆中拔出来。</p>
<p>有的人为了求得荣华富贵，绞尽脑汁，费尽心机，甚至不惜铤而走险，以命相搏，却不知富贵本为身外之物，一朝失去，便如过眼云烟，虽然得到也是失去；人生在世，不过百岁光阴，如果终日庸庸碌碌，无所作为，未能真正享受到人生的乐趣，则形同虚度，纵使长命百岁，也同寿短早夭一般无二。</p>
<p>人们总是喜欢陶醉在花红柳绿的春天里，沉迷于笙箫歌舞的场所中，其实，这些都是天地间虚幻的景象，是人心躁动浮荡的结果。不过，若要做到淡泊名利，就无须刻意地去粉饰自己，恭维他人，巴结上司，笼络帮伙，也无须为蜗角功名、蝇头小利去煞费苦心，辛苦奔波，上蹿下跳，苟且钻营；淡泊名利，就不会无情无义，脸厚心黑，猥琐自私，因而也不会令亲人失望，使朋友厌恶，被世人唾弃；淡泊名利，就会热心去生活，出自己的力，流自己的汗，作自己应有的贡献，不与名利纠缠，只要心无所愧，一任他人评说；淡泊名利，就会心无挂碍，意无妄想，行无羁绊，从而赢得精神、热情、乐观、健康和一片坦荡的胸怀！</p>
<p>昂藏老鹤饥，饮啄态犹闲</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>昂藏①老鹤虽饥，饮啄犹闲，肯同鸡鹜之营营②而竞食？偃蹇③寒松纵老，丰标④自在，岂似桃李之灼灼⑤而争研！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①昂藏：神态轩昂。</p>
<p>②营营：往来盘旋的样子。</p>
<p>③偃蹇：弯曲。</p>
<p>④丰标：丰满优美的风貌神态。</p>
<p>⑤灼灼：色彩鲜艳的样子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>神态轩昂的老鹤虽然饥饿，但在饮水啄食时还悠闲自得，怎肯像鸡鸭那样奔来奔去地争相啄食呢？枝干弯曲的寒松虽然苍老，但风貌神采依然优美潇洒，怎肯像桃李那样色彩鲜丽，争奇斗艳呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>英雄有落魄之时，壮士有潦倒之遇，落魄的英雄和潦倒的壮士也许会在一时间如同乞丐、贫民，但他们曾经是英雄、壮士，即便是沦落，他们依然是英雄和壮士，气度犹在，英豪不减。就像身世高贵的老鹤，即便是饥饿，一饮一啄还是一副神定气闲的高贵举止，怎么会与鸡鸭挤在一起争抢食物？寒冬里枯病的松树即便是再老，曾经高耸直立的姿态还在，哪里像桃花梨花那样，争着显示鲜艳的色彩！</p>
<p>识造化幻境，觅人物根宗</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>吾人适志于花柳烂漫之时，得趣于笙歌腾沸之处，乃是造化①之幻境，人心之荡念②也。须从木落草枯之后，向声稀味淡之中，觅得一些消息③，才是乾坤的橐龠④，人物的根宗⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①造化：大自然。</p>
<p>②荡念：放纵的欲望。</p>
<p>③消息：一消一长，互为更替的道理。</p>
<p>④橐龠（tuó yuè）：古代冶炼时用以鼓风吹火的风箱，比喻动力源泉。橐，外面的箱子；龠，送风管。</p>
<p>⑤根宗：根源。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人们若是在花红柳绿、春光明媚的时候寄托自己的心志，在笙歌沸腾、歌舞并作的地方享受乐趣，这实是天地间的虚幻梦境，人心中的放荡邪念。所以人们必须在寒风凛冽、叶落草枯之后，从没有音乐、没有美食佳肴的处境中寻求一些做人的道理，这才是推动天地动转的动力源泉，人与事物生存的根源。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>心志情怀，以宁静平淡为上，勃郁跌宕次之，而艳丽花俏又次之。而一般人通常的次序偏偏是倒过来。诸葛亮说：“静以修身，俭以养德。”让内心时时保持“静淡”，需要多大的功夫和毅力啊！其实，热闹，绚烂，只不过是瞬息而变的幻境，是人们心中放纵的念头。要想获知人生的真谛，那是必须向萧瑟之境、冷清之时去寻觅的。红花绿柳，轻歌曼舞，美则美矣，若沉溺其中，则为物累，反为俗情，非慕道君子所为。</p>
<p>东汉时期的姜岐，出生在一个富贵家庭，家里良田千顷，牛马成群。但是，在他很小的时候，父亲就因病去世了，他与哥哥姜岑生活在一起，共同侍奉寡母。姜岐不但聪慧有悟性，而且性情恬静，恪守礼教，对寡母尤其孝敬，在家乡汉阳郡内享有很高名望。</p>
<p>延熹年间，梁国人桥玄任汉阳郡太守。桥玄初到任时，想找一位有影响的人帮助他治理汉阳郡。经人推荐，得知姜岐是有名的贤士，学问渊博，便派人请姜岐任功曹之职。姜岐则以有病为由，不肯应聘。桥玄很不高兴，他认为姜岐借口有病不愿应聘，实际是不愿与自己共事，于是就命督邮尹益亲自去姜岐住处，逼其赴任，如果姜岐不从就逼迫他的母亲改嫁，如果还是不肯赴任就杀掉他。</p>
<p>“大人，做不得呀，逼迫人家寡母改嫁，这本身就是违背伦理道德的事，再滥杀无辜，天理难容啊！身为朝廷命官，我可不能这样干！”尹益语重心长地劝谏道。“我见姜岐是个人才，才有意抬举于他。可他对本官的良苦用心却不屑一顾。你怕我是真要杀他不成，我只不过是想用此法胁迫他赴任罢了。”桥玄对尹益说出了心里话。“以小人之见，姜岐从小就以孝顺闻名，家乡人都很敬仰他，他的崇高品德，不仅在汉阳郡内，就是在全荆州也很有名。倒不如让他在家隐居，教化弟子，通过他的影响，使郡县的民风为之一新。这不是比担任功曹更好吗？望大人权衡轻重，三思而行！”</p>
<p>尹益的一番话，说得太守眉开眼笑，他挥了挥手说道：“你的话不无道理，那就照你的话去办吧！”</p>
<p>静处观人事，闲中玩物情</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>静处观人事，即伊吕①之勋庸②、夷齐③之节义，无非大海浮沤④；闲中玩物情⑤，虽木石之偏枯⑥、鹿豕之顽蠢，总是吾性真如⑦。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①伊吕：即伊尹与吕尚，并称伊吕泛指辅弼重臣。伊尹，名挚，佐汤伐夏桀，被尊为阿衡（宰相）。吕尚，姜姓，号太公望，周武王时尊为师尚父，辅佐武王灭印。宋•刘过《沁园春寿》词：“平章处，看人如伊吕，世似唐虞。”</p>
<p>②勋庸：功勋与业绩。任昉《文选•宣德皇后令》：“功隆赏薄，嘉庸莫畴。”</p>
<p>③夷齐：伯夷与叔齐，商末孤竹君的两个儿子。周武王伐纣，两人叩马谏阻，商亡后，两人耻食周粟，逃到首阳山，采薇而食，饿死山中。唐李白《梁园吟》：“持盐把酒但饮之，莫学夷齐事高洁。”</p>
<p>④浮沤：水面上的泡沫。因其易生易灭，常比喻变化无常的世事和短暂的生命。</p>
<p>⑤物情：事物的情态。</p>
<p>⑥偏枯：残缺枯槁。</p>
<p>⑦真如：永恒常在的实体或实性。佛家认为宇宙本体，即是一心，不生不灭，故名为真。此真心，无异无相，故名为如。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在安静的地方观察世上的人与事，即使是伊尹吕尚的功勋业绩，伯夷叔齐的节操与义气，都无一不是海上漂浮的泡沫；在清闲的时候玩味事物的情态，即使树木山石偏斜枯竭，鹿猪顽劣愚蠢，都无一例外是宇宙万物的本性。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在安静的地方观察世上的人与事，即使是伊尹吕尚的功勛业绩，伯夷叔齐的节操与义气，都无一不是海上漂浮的泡沫；在清闲的时候玩味事物的情态，即使树木山石偏斜枯竭，鹿猪顽劣愚蠢，都无一例外是宇宙万物的本性。也惟有这些事是永恒长久的。这番议论的消极气度自不待言，无非是劝人浇熄一腔追名逐利的热情。但是身处竞争激烈的时代，尚未有所建树就一切都要看开看淡，就显得不合时宜了；不过若是功利之心太盛，这样的议论还是值得深思的。</p>
<p>看破有尽身，悟入无怀境</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>看破有尽身躯，万境之尘缘①自息；悟入②无怀境界③，一轮之心月④独明。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①尘缘：与尘世的因缘。</p>
<p>②悟入：觉知并证入实相。语本《法华经方便品》：“欲令众生悟佛知见，故出现于世；欲令众生入佛知见，故出现于世。”</p>
<p>③无怀境界：淳朴的境界。无怀，无怀氏，一作亡怀氏，传说中的远古部落，部落内人人安居乐业，心无好恶，老死不相往来。</p>
<p>④心月：佛教语，谓明净如月的心性。语本《菩提心论》：“照见本心，湛然清净，犹如满月，光遍虚空，无所分别。”</p>
<p>译文</p>

<p>东晋时期的郭翻，家住临川，过着隐居的生活。他为人正直，敦厚善良，谦恭礼让，勤劳节俭，深受家乡人爱戴。咸康末年，征西大将军郭翻乘船回故乡武昌祭扫祖先坟墓。庾翼趁机来到郭翻船上拜访他。庾翼拜访郭翻的唯一目的，是想聘用郭翻辅佐自己，治理好荆州。对此，郭翻毫不掩饰地说道：“人各有志。按我的性格、特长，我不适宜做官，因此，您就不必勉强我了。我不是您需要的那种人才！”庾翼满面堆笑说：“先生的船太小了，不便于长谈。我已聊备薄酒，小菜数碟，还望先生能够赏脸！”郭翻不便推却，只好同意。在庾翼宽敞、华丽的官船上，奴仆和兵丁侍候着庾翼和郭翻饮酒交谈，庾翼想尽办法说服郭翻出来做官，但高官厚禄、荣华富贵都打动不了郭翻的心，更谈不上金钱美女了。郭翻始终都坚持不肯做官，他们谈了很久，终因话不投机而仓促结束。</p>
<p>郭翻在权贵面前从不巴结、不逢迎，不肯受人恩惠，其恬淡的人品备受世人称颂。生命的形式无论怎样美丽、精致，都将因时间化作虚幻或粗糙。在宇宙天地中，在如白驹过隙的人生之中，人生价值的体现，不外乎建功立业或求名逐利。穷尽一生精力去追求理想，在现实面前却终是有志难酬，种种努力与追寻终成空想，于是叹息：如果能看穿看透具有尽头的身躯，万境尘世使人产生欲望的因缘便会自然止息；充分了解了生命有限的道理，自然就不会陷入尘世的追求之中。如果能觉悟进入无怀氏那样淳朴的境界，内心当中有如一轮明月，心性自然就清明澄澈了。</p>
<p>人之有生也，如太仓粒米</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人之有生也，如太仓①之粒米，如灼目之电光，如悬崖之朽木，如逝海②之巨波。知此者如何不悲？如何不乐？如何看他不破而怀贪生之虑？如何看他不重而贻③虚生之羞？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①大仓：储存粮食的官仓。</p>
<p>②逝海：流向大海。</p>
<p>③贻：遗留。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人的生命，就好像大粮仓里的一粒米那般渺小，像耀眼的一道闪光那般短暂，像悬崖边上的朽木那般脆弱，像波涛汹涌大海里的波涛那般飘浮不定。明白这些道理的人，怎么能不悲哀？又怎么会不喜悦呢？为什么还要看不透人生的真谛而怀有贪恋生命的想法呢？又为什么不看重自己的生命而留下虚度光阴的羞耻呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>大江东去，浪淘尽，千古风流人物，平凡的，不平凡的，都曾站在我们脚下的地方生活，他们哭过，笑过，爱过，恨过……也曾立下惊世伟业，也曾一生碌碌无为，最终不过化作脚下一堆黄土。因此既然我们很幸运地活在这世上，为什么我们不曾好好把握这难得的一次生死轮回的机会，努力拼搏、奋斗，创立一番事业呢？</p>
<p>明代陈白沙曾写过《戒戏歌》告诫人们不要因游戏而虚度光阴：“锣鼓喧天上翠楼，男人扮作女人头。少年容易成衰老，快活何难变困愁。金榜题名空富贵，洞房花烛假风流。须知光阴如过隙，莫作等闲去浪游。”人的生命，就好像大粮仓里的一粒米那般渺小，像耀眼的一道闪光那般短暂，像悬崖边上的朽木那般脆弱，像波涛汹涌大海里的波涛那般飘浮不定。明白这些道理的人，怎么能不悲哀？又怎么会不喜悦呢？为什么还要看不透人生的真谛而怀有贪恋生命的想法呢？又为什么不看重自己的生命而留下虚度光阴的羞耻呢？</p>
<p>觑鹬蚌兔犬，令人猛气消</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鹬蚌相持①，兔犬共毙②，冷觑来令人猛气全消；鸥凫共浴，鹿豕同眠，闲观去使我机心顿息。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①鹬（yù）蚌相持：比喻双方争执不下，两败俱伤，让第三者得到了好处。《战国策•燕策》：赵且伐燕，苏代为燕谓惠王曰：“今者臣来，过易水，蚌方出曝，而鹬啄其肉，蚌合而莫过甘其喙。鹬曰：‘今日不雨，明日不雨，即有死蚌！’蚌亦谓鹬曰：‘今日不出，明日不出，即有死鹬！’两者不肯相舍。渔者得而并擒之。今赵且伐燕，燕赵久相支，以弊大众。臣恐强秦之为渔父也。故愿王熟计之也。”</p>
<p>②兔犬共毙：比喻事情成功以后，把出过大力的人杀掉。《史记•越王勾践世家》：“（范蠡）自齐遗大夫（文）种书曰：‘蜚鸟尽，良弓藏；狡兔死，走狗烹。’”后用以比喻事成被弃。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>鹬蚌相互争执不下，它们两个都被人擒获；狡兔死后，走狗也遭杀戮。它们都是彼此相互伤害，最终同归于尽。冷眼观看，真令人勇猛好斗之气完全消退。鸥与凫在同一个水塘中嬉戏，鹿与猪在同一个地方安睡，它们都是彼此互不伤害，所以都能相安无事，悠闲看去，便使人奸滑巧诈的心思顿时停息消散。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>汉高祖曾问群臣：“吾何以得天下？”群臣回答皆不得要领。刘邦遂说：“我之所以有今天，得力于三个人——运筹帷幄之中，决胜千里之外，吾不如张良；镇守国家，安抚百姓，不断供给军粮，吾不如萧何；率百万之众，战必胜，攻必取，吾不如韩信。三位皆人杰，吾能用之，此吾所以取天下者也。”就是这个人杰韩信功高震主，却毫无自我保护意识，终于在未央宫阴谋中死于吕后之手。</p>
<p>天下已定，英雄当烹，中外古今，概莫能外。丘吉尔在战争期间依靠民众浴血奋战，受到人民的爱戴。然而随着反法西斯战争胜利的接近，他骄傲武断与日俱增。他以为他有拯救英国的丰功伟绩，据此可以打败一切竞争对手，但在1945年英国大选中，他却落选。面对结果，丘吉尔呆若木鸡半晌无语后，叹道：“英国人民成熟了，他们不需要一个英雄领导他们重建家园。”</p>
<p>一位禅师说：“冷眼似灰，热情似火。”尽管心里充满了热情，可是眼睛却像火的灰烬，冷静地观照这个世界，就能到达处世的至高境界。</p>
<p>苦乐无二境，迷悟非两心</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>迷则乐境成苦海，如水凝为冰；悟则苦海为乐境，犹冰涣①作水。可见苦乐无二境，迷悟非两心，只在一转念间耳。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①涣：融解。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人如果执迷不悟，那么喜悦的境界也会变为痛苦的深渊，就像水凝结成冰一样；如果能清醒觉悟，那么即使身处痛苦的深渊也会变为快乐的境界，就像冰融化成水。由此可见，苦与乐本来就不是两种不同的境遇，迷与悟本来也不是两种不同的心境，其区别只在于念头转变的一瞬间。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有这样一段话：“避苦求乐是人性的自然，多苦少乐是人生的必然，能苦会乐是做人的坦然，化苦为乐是智者的超然，心态决定苦与乐，观念决定成与败。”这段话道出了人生苦与乐之间的真谛——要善待生活，善待自己，让生命在生活中追寻快乐。</p>

<p>周瑜发出过“既生瑜，何生亮”的感慨。将死之时周瑜竟还无法摆脱嫉妒的心理，如此英才因心胸狭窄而死，可见心态的重要性。有的人总是无法接受别人比自己强的事实，在妒忌中郁郁寡欢；而有的人看到别人比自己强，向别人学习，把别人作为自己的人生坐标，不断提高自己。所以，拥有良好的心态，可以有愉快的心境和前进的动力。</p>
<p>苏东坡一生仕途不顺，多次被发配荒夷之地，最后被发配到瘟疫横生的海南，跟着他去的仆人都因病死去了，只有苏东坡在逆境中活了下来，这和苏东坡乐观的心态和健康的心理不无关系。</p>
<p>同一种际遇和环境，往往有人乐观，有人悲观，其根本的原因就在于人的内心本质，即心态。人如果执迷不悟，那么喜悦的境界也会变为痛苦的深渊，就像水凝结成冰一样；如果能清醒觉悟，那么即使身处痛苦的深渊也会变为快乐的境界，就像冰融化成水。由此可见，苦与乐本来就不是两种不同的境遇，迷与悟本来也不是两种不同的心境，其区别只在于念头转变的一瞬间。</p>

<p>满室清风，满几①月，坐中物物见天心；一溪流水，一山云，行处时时观妙道②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①几：矮而小的桌子。</p>
<p>②妙道：自然界变化运转的规律。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>满室皆是清风，满桌皆是月光，坐定时所见到的每件东西都可以看出天赋的本性；一溪的流水，一山的行云，行走的地方随时都可以看到自然界变化运转的规律。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在动静有致的自然山水中寻找生活的乐趣，寄寓自己高洁淡雅的情怀，在淡泊的心态中领悟优雅情调的真趣。现实中，我们应给心灵一点空间，在对自然与人生的认知中，静静品味生活，感悟人生。</p>
<p>李调元是乾隆皇帝时的御史大夫，为人刚正清廉，颇受人推崇，一向爱才的乾隆皇帝也很满意这个尽忠职守的臣属。李调元的妻子冯氏，也出身于书香官宦世家，夫妻二人琴瑟相调，相敬如宾，是京官中难得的恩爱夫妻。</p>
<p>后来，李调元因仗义执言，上书直言和珅的不是，遭到和珅多方网罗捏造罪证的陷害，被判充军伊犁。在此期间，妻子冯氏因为和丈夫险些生离死别，痛苦万分。后来，李调元经多方营救，终于澄清事实，得赦回京。冯氏见丈夫平安归来，喜出望外。等李调元回到家中，她备下美味酒菜，为丈夫接风。在畅饮时，冯氏出一上联：“月圆月缺，月缺月圆，年年岁岁，暮暮朝朝，黑夜尽头方见日。”李调元听罢，颇有感触，想了想，然后对道：“花开花落，花落花开，夏夏秋秋，暑暑凉凉，严冬过后始逢春。”这一副叠字联，对得情深意切，离别分合之苦，重新相聚之乐尽在其中。夫妻二人相视而笑，陶醉在团聚的幸福之中。</p>
<p>人生总难免风浪波折，但是总不能因为前途的曲折坎坷，而就此止步不前，那么面对已经有过的苦难，要以轻松的笑容面对。用愉悦的方式来调解生活，才会使生活更为平和、生动、幸福。</p>
<p>扫地白云起，才著便起障</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>扫地白云起，才著功夫便起障碍；凿①池明月入，能空境界自生明。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①凿：挖凿。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>扫地时，若有一缕阳光照进来，便能够看到尘埃飞起，就像白云骤起，才下点工夫马上又产生了新障碍。在地上凿个水池，皓月当空时，便可以在池子里看到月亮。能保持境界的虚幻，自然会产生智慧。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>“扫地白云起”，意同无心插柳柳成荫。事物的发展都是相关联的，有因就有果，一旦有所行动，行动的对象和环境就会相应有所变化，无论采取怎样的动作，都会有相应的连锁反应，关键还是心态的反应，要想得通，看得透，怨天尤人是没有实际意义的。</p>
<p>“凿池明月入”，可以理解为水到渠成，不用故意强求目标，在诚心去“凿池”时，“明月”自然会来。世间事情本有因果之道，所以我们需要努力提升自己的修养和学问，有一颗正直的心，努力去把该做的事情做好，追求的目标自然就会实现。</p>
<p>唐朝中期著名女诗人薛涛，出身官宦世家，但是家道中落使得这位曾经养尊处优的贵族小姐，不得已为了讨生活，自入乐籍。薛涛曾经依附过成都的高官，有一次，她与这位高官一起出行前往松州。在路上薛涛以这位高官准夫人的身份接受了沿途小官吏们的谒见。薛涛只是一时贪玩，却万没想到这个曾经给了她校书职位，一直对她倍加欣赏的人，竟然大发雷霆，还险些将薛涛依法治罪，流配远方。总算在很多人的劝阻下，才放过薛涛。薛涛从此再不敢张扬，也终于认清了自己乐籍身份的悲哀。</p>
<p>松州之行使薛涛彻底认识到自己寄人篱下、卑微低贱的生活处境。回成都后不久，她便脱去乐籍，退居浣花溪畔。她在这里结庐而居，还在门前种满琵琶花，远远望去就像置身于绚丽如霞的花海中。在距离薛涛草庐不远的地方，就是通往长安的大道，那里车水马龙，行人往来不绝。</p>
<p>虽然薛涛脱去乐籍，但是她的才名文笔还是受人仰慕，她住的地方也成了许多文人倾慕之所。他们或登门拜访，或与这位才女以诗书相往还，这样平静的生活才使得薛涛觉得生活不再无所依托。</p>
<p>生活之所以乏味，是因为不懂得将乏味的生活调理得有声有色。也许就是一张小小的卡片，抑或是一只别致的杯子，那精致细微的趣味，慢慢累积起来就可以把生活填上各种各样的色彩，也在不知不觉间，改变了原有生活的味道。</p>

<p>①造化：天地、自然、命运。</p>
<p>②渠：他。《玉台新咏古诗为焦仲卿妻作》：“渠会永无缘。”</p>
<p>③丸：捏，抟。</p>
<p>④炉锤：锤炼。苏轼《次韵孙莘老见赠时》：“炉鎚一手赋形殊，造物无心敢忘渠。”</p>

<p>命运被人称作喜怒无常的孩子，千万不要被他戏弄；把天地捏成一个大土块，究竟该是什么样子，可以任我们锤炼。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>左思原为齐国临淄人，早年读过汉朝班固写的《两都赋》和张衡的《二京赋》两篇名作后，他对这两篇佳作都有自己的看法，认为有些描写流于虚幻、缺乏事实根据。他决心学习前人，超过前人，把三国时代的魏都邺城、吴都建业、蜀都成都合起来写篇《三都赋》。为了写好这篇赋，左思下了很大的工夫。他向在四川做过官的著作郎张望载了解成都的风貌；他找来了有关“三都”的图书典籍，认真考察。为了集中精力构思写作，他闭门谢客，专心致志。左思还在房间里、院落里甚至厕所里都挂上纸片，放上笔墨，一有灵感就随手记下。有的纸片上的文字，涂了又涂，一改再改。他的夫人为他送来饭菜，他也忘了吃。一次，他正在挥笔写作，忽然想到应该吃点东西了，待到把一口菜送到嘴里，感到不是滋味，吐出来一看：那菜黑糊糊的——原来他是把毛笔当做筷子夹菜了。</p>
<p>经过一番苦心写作，《三都赋》终于写成了。他为这篇文章，前后花了十年的时间，满以为会受到士子们的赞赏，没想到拿出去征求意见时，竟受到一伙人的嘲讽。原来，他要写《三都赋》的风声一传出去，就有人断定他这个山野之民难登大雅之堂。有位叫张华的人对他说，有位皇甫谧先生是当今文坛领袖，你可以请他评论一下再做计较。于是，左思把《三都赋》送呈皇甫谧。皇甫谧读后，击掌赞赏。为了奖掖新秀，皇甫谧亲笔为之作序，并请人为之作注解。顿时，《三都赋》成为洛阳百姓交口称赞的好文章。文学家陆机，原来看不起左思，还打算自己写篇《三都赋》，后来看到左思《三都赋》的抄本，自叹弗如，放弃了写《三都赋》的念头。</p>
<p>专心致志，是左思获得成功的重要原因之一。他全身心都投入到了写作之中，不受外界任何干扰，这是难能可贵的。命运常被人称作喜怒无常的孩子，千万不要被他戏弄；把天地捏成一个大土块，究竟该是什么样子，可以任我们锤炼。左思便是用自己的雄心壮志，锤炼了一片天地！</p>
<p>若非上上智，便无了了心</p>

<p>山河大地已属微尘，而况尘中之尘①；血肉身躯且归泡影，而况影外之影②。非上上智③，无了了④心。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①尘中之尘：比喻人及一切生物的渺小。</p>
<p>②影外之影：指身外的名利权位如镜中花水中月转眼即逝。</p>
<p>③上上智：最高的智慧。</p>
<p>④了：明白、明了。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>山河大地与无限的宇宙空间相比，不过是一粒尘埃，而地球上生存的小小生物和无边的宇宙一比，不过是微尘中的微尘。我们的躯体与漫长绵延无限的时间相比，不过是一朵短暂的浪花泡影，何况是那些比生命更短暂的功名富贵，不过是泡影外的泡影。所以，一个没有高深智慧的人，是不能具有彻悟真理之心的。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>《维摩经》说：“巍巍须弥山，可纳于一粒芥子中；四海之水，可容入一个毛孔里。”须弥山是世界的中心，它的四周都是海洋；就是这样的高山也可以装入芥子中，就是这样的巨海也可以放进毛发之中。苏东坡在《前赤壁赋》中说：“寄蜉蝣于天地，渺沧海之一粟；哀吾生之须臾，羡长江之无穷；挟飞仙以遨游，抱明月而长终；知不可乎骤得，托遗响于悲风。……天地之间，物各有主；苟非吾之所有，虽一毫而莫取。惟江上之清风，与山间之明月，耳得之而为声，目遇之而成色。取之无尽，用之不竭，是造物者无尽藏也，而吾与子之所共适也。”这是一种“万象皆空幻，达人须达观”的旷达胸怀！</p>

<p>④耽：倾，倾轧。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人只要有视富贵如浮云的节气，就不必隐居到深山洞穴当中去脱离俗世、修身养性；人只要没有沉溺山水风景到嗜狂成痴的地步，经常喝酒吟诗做对也是一番乐趣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>“清初三先生”之一的顾炎武从小喜欢读《孙子兵法》和《资治通鉴》、《史记》等书，十分关心历史。后来顾炎武参加科举，没有考中，就干脆下决心放弃科举，通读历代历史典籍，研究全国各地的地方志和历代名人奏章，开始编写一本重要的历史地理著作《天下郡国利病书》。</p>
<p>正当他用心治学的时候，明朝灭亡，清兵南下，江南各地人民都组织抗清斗争，顾炎武和他的两位好友也参加了保卫昆山的战斗。昆山军民跟清军激战21天后，因为兵力悬殊，最终失败。昆山城陷落的时候，顾炎武的生母被清兵斩断了右臂。抚养他成长的继母，听到清兵攻破常熟，就绝食自杀，临死时嘱咐顾炎武说：“我虽然是个女子，以身殉国也是理所应当的。希望你不要做其他国家的臣子，不要辜负世代的国恩，不要忘记先祖的遗训。”顾炎武痛哭一场，葬了继母，离开了家乡。他想渡海去投奔鲁王，还没有去成，鲁王政权已经覆灭了。顾炎武隐姓改名，在长江南北一带奔走，想组织一支抗清义军，但毕竟势孤力单，没能成功。后来，顾炎武离开了江南，决心到北方去游历。一来想考察各地的地理形势，风俗民情；二来也想找机会结交一些志同道合的朋友。他在长途跋涉的艰苦环境里，并没有放弃学术研究。一路上，他用两匹马、四匹骡子，驮着他的书箱。遇到关塞险要的地方，他就访问当地的退伍老兵，了解那里的风土人情，如果跟他在书本上读到的不一样，就拿出书本核对，这样他的知识就更丰富了。顾炎武从45岁起，用了20多年时间，在山东、山西、河北、江南来回奔走，每年差不多有一半时间住在客栈里。他还曾经和朋友一起，在雁北开垦荒地。到了晚年，才在陕西华阴定居下来。</p>
<p>在这个充满诱惑的纷繁世界里，“有浮云富贵之气，而不必岩栖穴处。”人只要有视富贵如浮云的节气，就不必隐居到深山洞穴当中去脱离俗世、修身养性，可以像顾炎武这样历经人生的曲折和坎坷，依旧能谈笑风生，心性归于宁静。</p>

<p>别人争名夺利与我无关，我也不必因为别人醉心名利就嫌弃疏远他；保持恬静淡泊的心性是为了顺应自己的个性，因此也不必向别人夸耀自己“世人皆醉我独醒”的清高。这就是佛祖所说的“既不被物欲所蒙蔽，也不被空虚寂寞所困扰，能做到这些，就是一个身自在而心悠然的人”。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>唐朝名臣陆贽，不但文武双全，更是清慎自守，对自己为官为人自律甚严。尽管他因才德很受德宗皇帝的器重，但是，他从未因此自骄自大，结党营私扩张自己势力，而是尽忠职守，兢兢业业。德宗曾一度在政务上完全离不开陆贽，君臣之间，食则同席，寝则同榻。甚至在寒冷的冬天，皇帝还将自己的衣裳亲手披在陆贽的身上。还有一次，君臣一起进山打猎，因为道路复杂，一时不慎走散了。德宗焦急万分，甚至悬赏一千两黄金来寻找陆贽的下落，直到陆贽回来，他才高兴起来，快乐的表情，使得上自太子下到群臣，都进言庆贺。可是，就是这么个德宗皇帝，却同样昏庸无能，偏听偏信，最后听信奸臣谗言，不辨真伪，不分好坏，差点杀掉忠心为君为国的陆贽。而他要置这个曾与他不分你我的近臣于死地的原因，却好笑得可怜。</p>
<p>奸臣攻击陆贽谢绝一切公私礼物，完全是为了“沽名钓誉”，虽然他表面上要“杜绝私交”，其实是为自己收买人心，而这样还会影响上下之间的关系。据说，德宗甚至专门下“密旨”给陆贽，怪罪他“清慎太过”，并要求陆贽要接受“细小物品”的礼物。但是对自己要求甚严的陆贽不能苟同德宗的这种观点，上疏陈述自己的看法，认为今天收了小礼物，明天就会接受大礼物，以至于没有尽头，欲望也会越来越大。陆贽的观点，正是防微杜渐的意思，是对个人修养的高标准。陆贽甚至还借机劝诫德宗不可以过于奢华，这恰恰一再触及了德宗的痛点，最后陆贽终因直言上书，被德宗治罪，差点连命都丟了。</p>
<p>最后，经过众大臣极力保荐，陆贽被流放远方。可怜陆贽一片忠心，最后竟因为自己清心无欲，为国为民，被流放荒蛮之地。陆贽尽管被流放，但是还是忠心于朝廷，为了免人口实，他在流放地既不著述亦不教学，一个人孤苦凄凉病死在流放地。</p>

<p>机闲一日遥，意宽斗室广</p>

<p>延促①由于一念，宽窄系之寸心。故机闲②者一日遥于千古，意宽③者斗室④广于两间。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①延促：长短。</p>
<p>②机闲：心机清闲。</p>
<p>③意宽：心境宽广空旷。</p>
<p>④斗室：极言房间之小。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>岁月的长短本来不在于岁月本身的变化，而在于人心的感觉，世界的宽窄原本也不在于世界本身的大小，而在于人心的体验。所以心机清闲的人看岁月，一天比千年还要漫长；心胸开阔的人看世界，一间斗室比天地还要宽广。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在战乱时代，荣华富贵多在一夜之间而来，尤其是对武将来说，建功沙场，然后论功领赏是很正当的。但是就有一些人心胸豁达，眼光长远，不计较一时得失，谦虚谨慎，反复推功，反而更加得到信任。徐世绩就是因为推功而获得了唐朝两代皇帝的信任和重用。</p>
<p>隋末天下大乱，徐世绩追随李密起义。李密被隋朝将领王世充打败，带领众人投靠了唐军。这时，徐世绩仍然坚守黎阳仓，他对长史郭孝恪说：“魏公（李密）已经归顺了大唐，现在这里的人口和土地是魏公所有的。我如果上表献给唐军，就是趁着主子战败，自己居功邀赏，这是让我感到耻辱的。现在最好是准备好州县和军队的人口册子，全部交给魏公，请魏公自己抉择，这就是魏公的功劳了。”于是便派使者去见李密并说明情况。其实，李密对徐世绩已经没有任何的管制，如果徐绩直接向唐献上表示降服，可以为己邀功而得到重赏。但徐世绩并没有这样做，而是让李密献上，推功于故主，表现了他的谦让和忠厚。</p>
<p>李渊知道这件事后，对他非常赞赏，高兴地说：“徐世绩感德推功，不忘旧主，实在是纯臣、忠臣啊。”于是下诏封他为黎阳总管，加封上柱国公、莱国公，后来又升其为武卫大将军，改封曹国公，赐姓李。唐太宗即位后，因为犯了唐太宗李世民的名讳，徐世绩将名字中的“世”去掉，故称徐绩。后来，徐绩随唐太宗征伐，多建功勋，得到恩宠，唐太宗曾对他说：“朕欲托孤，思来想去没有人比你更合适了。你以往能不负李密，现在怎么可能辜负朕呢？”太宗病危时，他果然被委以托孤重任。</p>
<p>为人心胸豁达，不计较鸡毛小利，于有意无意间表现自己忠厚的本性，必能打动人心，尤其若为领导者所识，必有回报。徐世绩推功并非惺惺作态，而是他一贯的豁达作风使然，这一作为使他失去了表功的机会，但却被明君欣赏、重用，达到了为人臣者的终极地位。</p>

<p>老庄提倡无为，所谓出世哲学；儒家主张进取，倡导入世哲学，二者构成中国古代士大夫一种处世哲学；进则求取功名兼济天下，退则隐居山林修身养性。所谓“隐者高明，省事平安”，对世俗而言则是“多一事不如少一事”，“多做多错，少做少错，不做不错”，对隐者而言本身是不求名，更无所谓虚名了。所以自古就有“君子盛德，容貌若愚”的说法，即人的才华不可外露，宜深明韬光养晦之道，才不会招致世俗小人的忌恨。</p>
<p>宋代谏议大夫刘安世在《元城先生语录》中有一段文字说：苏东坡被御史谢景温诬告乃至下狱。当时张安道在南京做官，就向皇帝上疏营救他。本想附在南京府的公文中递交皇上，府官不敢接受。于是张安道就命令他的儿子张恕到登闻鼓院将信投进去，张恕徘徊再三，终于未敢投书。不久，东坡出了狱，后来看见那封上疏的副本，不由得伸出舌头，脸色都变了。有人问他为何如此，东坡未回答。后来苏东坡的弟弟苏子由看了那副本，说：“我哥哥当然要吐舌头了！这件事全靠张恕之力。”仆人问：“为什么呢？”子由说：“难道你不知道汉代郑昌救宽饶的事吗？郑昌上书说：‘上无许史之属，下无金张之托，这话正激起汉宣帝的愤怒。而且宽饶有什么罪过呢？正是因为触犯了许史之辈而遭祸。再来上疏，就更添加了几分怒气。如今东坡也没有罪，只不过是名气太高，与朝廷争胜负。张安道的上疏说东坡实在是天下之奇才，难道不只有激起人主的愤怒吗？”仆人说：“那么当时要救东坡，应该怎么说呢？”子由说：“只说本朝还未曾杀过士大夫，如今就从陛下开始，后世子孙必然要援引陛下为例子。神宗好名而畏义，也许可以制止那件事。”</p>
<p>去留无所系，静躁不相干</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>孤云出岫①，去留一无所系；朗镜悬空，静躁两不相干。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①岫：山洞。张协《七命》：“临重岫而揽辔，顾石室而回轮。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>孤云从山谷中飘出来，它来去自由无牵无挂，无论是远去还是停留与别的事物都没有任何关系；明月高悬空中，人间的安静与喧闹都与它毫不相关。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>陶渊明的《归去来兮辞》说：“云无心而出岫，鸟倦飞而知还。”也就是说，万物现象都是往还来去一任自然的。一轮明月悬照在天空之中，它的皎洁光明，照耀着下界的静寂或是喧噪的各地方，没有一点厚此薄彼的分别。人的出处进退也应当像孤云无心出岫，人心的明朗更应当像悬在空中的明月一般。</p>
<p>荣启期是春秋战国时期有名的隐士，在动乱的年代里，这位老庄的信徒相信无为而治，在自然中寻求自己的安宁和满足。他隐居山林，自给自足。当儒士策士们为了自己的观念和名利积极争取入世，穿梭在各国之间时，荣启期安守清寒，自得其乐。一天，荣启期刚刚做完自己田地的工作，开心地在郊野中行走。他穿着粗糙的皮衣，腰里系着一根绳子，邋里邋遢的。他面目清瘦，肤色黝黑，一看就是终年辛苦劳作的人。可是他却愉快地一面弹琴，一面唱歌，无忧无虑。荣启期走到半路，遇见了这时一直游历各国的孔子，孔子看着他的行状，有些不理解，问道：“您这样贫穷却又如此快乐，这是为什么呢？”荣启期回答说：“我快乐的原因太多了。大自然孕育各种飞禽走兽、昆虫鱼虾，只有人最尊贵。我能够做人，这是第一快乐。人有男女之分，男的尊贵，女的卑贱。我生为男人，这是第二快乐。人生下来，有的没有看到日月便夭殇，有的还没有脱离母亲的怀抱便短命而亡，我却活到九十岁了，这是第三快乐。贫穷是人的一般情况，死亡是人的必然结果，人们害怕恐惧的不过是人生的一般情况和最终的结果罢了。我之所以可以如此安然地面对，也不过是安于一般情况，等待必然结果，还有什么忧虑呢？”</p>
<p>盖心无染着，欲境是仙都</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>山林是胜地，一营恋①便成市朝②；书画是雅事，一贪痴便成商贾③。盖心无染着，欲境是仙都；心有系牵，乐境成悲地。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①营恋：营，迷惑；恋，留恋。《孙膑兵法•威王门》：“营而离之，我并卒而击之。”</p>
<p>②市朝：这里喻指庸俗喧嚣。市，交易场所；朝，君臣谋划政事的地方。</p>
<p>③贾：商人。《盐铁论•轻重》：“笼天下盐铁诸利，以排富商大贾。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>风景秀丽的林泉本是名胜之地，可是一旦沾迷留恋，那么幽境胜景就会变成庸俗喧嚣的闹区；书法绘画本来是骚人墨客的一种高雅趣味，可是一旦产生贪求和痴恋，就会把风雅的事变得庸俗市侩。所以一个人只要心地纯真没有污染，即使身在人欲横流的环境中也如同在仙境一般；反之一旦内心迷恋声色物欲，即使置身山间的快乐仙境，也会使自己如置身苦海中一样痛苦。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>所谓俗与雅并不在于事物本身，而在于支配事物者的主观感受，所以《维摩经》中才有“心静则佛土也静”，意思是说俗雅完全出于心的反应。所谓苦与乐也不在于环境本身，而完全在于人对事物所产生的感受，因而《华严经》中才有“处于世间，一切事皆如虚空，如莲花之著水”，意思是劝人处世的秘诀是不要著相。</p>
<p>荀子说，大丈夫根据时势，需要屈就屈，需要伸就伸，可以屈就屈，可以伸就伸屈于当屈之时，智慧；伸于可伸之机，亦智慧。屈是保存力量，伸，是光大力量；屈，是隐匿自我，伸，是高扬自我；屈，是生之低谷，伸，是生之峰巅。有低谷，有峰巅，犬牙交错，波浪行进，这才构成完满而丰富的人生。荀子说，大丈夫推崇他人的德行，颂扬他人的美德，这不是出于阿谀奉承；公正地、坦率地指出他人的错误，这不是出于诽谤和挑剔；客观地、中肯地表白自己光明磊落，与舜禹相比拟，与天地相参合，这不叫虚夸狂妄。随时势能屈能伸，柔顺如同蒲席，可尽可张，这不是出于胆小怕事；刚强、勇敢而又坚毅，从不屈服于人，这不是出于骄傲暴戾。</p>
<p>其实在我们平日的心态中就有道，所以无门和尚诗说：“春有百花秋有月，夏有凉风冬有雪；若无闲事挂心头，便是人间好时节。”假如我们能做到这些，那么就永远生活在乐境中而不为物欲所苦，进而再以“醒时同交欢，醉后各分散；永结无情游，相期邈云汉”的胸襟来透视人生。</p>
<p>若静躁稍分，则昏明顿异</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>时当喧杂，则平日所记忆者皆漫然忘去；境在清宁，则夙昔①所遗忘者又恍尔②现前③。可见静躁稍分，昏明顿异。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①夙昔：以往，过去。杜甫《骢马行》：“夙昔传闻思一见。”</p>
<p>②恍尔：恍然，忽然。</p>
<p>③现前：出现在眼前。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>每当周遭环境喧嚣杂乱使心情浮躁时，平日所记住的事情都会慢慢忘掉；每当周遭环境安宁使心神平和时，以前所遗忘的事情又仿佛会呈现在眼前。由此可见，心神的浮躁和宁静稍有区分，昏暗与光明就会迥然不同。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>水清明月现，心静思自明。当我们用木杖去搅清静水，水混了泥沙都会浮起来，这时候水底的任何东西都看不清了，等水澄清了之后，泥沙沉到底下，这时候看便能看得一清二楚。所以，心常保持清静，对于外事外物自然能够了解得透彻。</p>
<p>战国时期，魏国的信陵君窃符救赵之后，魏王十分恼恨，嫌恶他竟敢偷走自己的兵符，假传命令杀死晋鄙。信陵君自己也知道这件事得罪了魏王，保全赵国之后，便派了一个将军率领晋鄙的军队回魏国去，他本人和门客却留在了赵国。赵孝成王感激信陵君率大军救赵国于危急之中，与平原君商议之后，决定把五个城封给他。信陵君听到这个消息，十分高兴。而他的一位门客知道后，对信陵君说：“有的事情不可忘，有的事情不可不忘。别人有恩于公子，公子绝对不可忘记；公子有恩于人，希望公子尽快忘了吧。再说，假传魏王命令，夺取晋鄙的军队来救赵，对赵国是有功，可对于魏国就算不忠不义了，并不是一件十分光彩的事情。公子却以这件事为有功而骄傲，我认为这是不可取的，公子不应该这样。”</p>
<p>信陵君</p>
<p>信陵君听了心里被触动了，立即开始责备自己，惭愧得无地自容。赵孝成王打算打扫庭前台阶，亲自迎接信陵君，从东阶而上，用当时的最高礼节来对他进行封赏。信陵君却连称自己有罪，有负于魏国，亦无功于赵国，好像把救赵之事完全忘了。赵王更加敬佩信陵君。后来魏王也时时挂念自己的这个兄弟，原谅了他的过错，屡次派人请他回国，但他内心非常惭愧，觉得没脸回去。几年之后，恢复了战争能力的秦国大举进攻蒸蒸日上的魏国，魏国处于下风，节节败退，形势十分不利。信陵君觉得机会到了，就带着自己的门客回到了祖国，被魏王封为上将军，抗击秦军。信陵君迸发了压抑了十年的报国激情，利用自己的影响，组成了五国合纵军，亲自率领这支军队大败秦军。</p>
<p>身常放闲处，不受荣辱遣</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>身常放在闲处，荣辱得失谁能差遣我？此心常安在静中，是非利害谁能瞒昧①我？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①瞒昧：隐瞒实情。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>只要经常把自己的身心放在安闲的环境中，世间所有的荣华富贵成败得失就都无法左右我；只要经常让自己的身心处在安宁清静的环境中，人间的功名利禄与是是非非就不能欺蒙我。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>庄子追索人生苦难的终极原因，发现一切灾难都根源于人类自身无穷无尽的欲望，因此人必须忘却世间一切相对的是非得失，从精神上打破时空封界，才能解开尘俗烦忧、苦痛缠绕的情结，摆脱功名利禄的藩篱。而庄子驰骋于“无何有之乡，广莫之野”的逍遥游思想，是一种绝对的精神自由，对后世产生了深远的影响。</p>
<p>有一次，信奉阴阳学说的景春对孟子说：“当今的公孙衍和张仪难道不是真正的大丈夫吗？他们一发怒，那些诸侯便都害怕得安静下来，天下便太平无战。”孟子不同意这说法，他说：这怎么称得上是大丈夫呢？一个人应居住于天下最宽广的位置，那就是“仁”，要站立在最正确的位置，那就是“礼”，该行走于最光明的大道，那就是“义”。得志，便与百姓循道而进，失意，也能独自坚持自己的原则。富贵不能乱我心，贫贱不能改我志，威武不能屈我节，这才叫做大丈夫。有节操者方可称丈夫。由此看来，节操也就是人的气节与操守。一腔正气，可贯长虹，不虚饰，不苟且，不贪恋荣华富贵，不惧怕权势强力，不以全身而偷生，不为五斗米而折腰，这就是气节。知正道而持行不怠，守本性而遗世独立，行仁仗义，依理遵道，这就是操守。人之节操，存于内则为仁德，化于外则为坚贞，执于行则成义礼，达于人则为典范，说到底，立命处世，节操是人之根本。</p>
<p>在日益膨胀的物欲面前，人的物化程度愈加严重，对金钱利益的注重代替了对固有理想价值的崇奉追求，物的价值和物对人的意义被不断放大，人对物的依赖日趋紧密，在这种情况下，“闲”和“静”要求人们不要成为庸俗尘世生活的奴隶，不要为名利所累，摆脱精神的羁绊和心灵的牢笼，寻求灵魂的恬静和心灵的逍遥自在。</p>
<p>我不希荣贵，何忧利禄饵</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>我不希①荣，何忧乎利禄之香饵②？我不竞进③，何畏乎仕宦之危机？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①希：希望，追求。</p>
<p>②香饵：诱惑人的东西。</p>
<p>③竞进：竞争，争进。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>我不追求荣华富贵，又怎么会担心别人用利禄作为诱饵来引诱我上钩呢？我不和别人竞争，又怎么会害怕官场中隐藏的危险呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>不追求荣华富贵，也就不会害怕荣华富贵的诱惑。不和别人争夺高低，也就不会害怕官场中隐藏的危险。心中没有私心欲念，也就不会瞻前顾后，唯恐落入他人圈套中。正所谓“海纳百川，有容乃大。壁立千仞，无欲则刚”。无欲无求，也就不会有恐慌畏惧。中国历史上有许多无欲无求，不贪求荣华富贵的高人隐士。</p>
<p>三国时有一位叫管宁的人，他不贪图荣华富贵，却积极为教化世人努力。管宁少年时就很有气节，他与华歆、邴原为同学。据说有一次华歆与管宁一同在菜园中劳作。华歆突然挖到一块金子，顿时十分高兴，把金子拿在手中乐不可支，连连赞叹。管宁照旧锄地，他完全没有像华歆那样看到金子惊叹不已。华歆感觉到惭愧，就把金子扔了。还有一次，两个人正坐在一起读书，突然听到外面传来鼓乐声，有一位显贵路过这里。华歆放下书跑出去看热闹，管宁把他们同坐的席子割成两半，与华歆划清界限，从此不再和华歆做朋友。当时战乱频繁，管宁和邴原为了避战乱，带着家眷同到辽东居住。管宁在辽东，开设学堂，教化当地人民。用中原的诗书礼仪教化当地人民。当地民风剽悍，乡民好争斗。有人在井边因为争着打水而打架，管宁知道了就自己出钱买了一些木桶。他让人用这些木桶打满水，放在井旁边供大家使用。乡民知道这件事后，感觉很惭愧，从此以后不再因争着打水而打架了。</p>
<p>曹丕当上皇帝之后，管宁年岁已大，想回故乡，于是就带着家人回到家乡。管宁走的时候把辽东首领送他的礼物，都原封不动地还了回去。回家乡后，有人请他做官，他一概拒绝。他布衣蔬食，亲自下地耕作，夏天用清澈的溪水浇灌菜园，浸泡双脚，怡然自若，自得其乐，活了八十四岁去世。管宁一生清高，不贪图荣华富贵，不攀附豪门权贵，甘于布衣粗食，不改变自己的气节。</p>
<p>多藏亡则厚，高步颠则疾</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>多藏厚亡①，故知富不如贫之无虑；高步疾颠②，故知贵不如贱之常安。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①多藏厚亡：藏得多，失去也就多。</p>
<p>②高步疾颠：步子迈得高，跌倒也就快。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人金银财物贮藏得越多，损失也就越重，由此可知，富足的人不如贫穷的人那样无忧无虑；一个人步子迈得越高，跌倒也就越快，由此可知，高贵的人不如卑贱的人那样逍遥自在。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>俗语所说“漫藏诲盗”、“多藏厚亡”、“怀璧其罪”，都是说明财富是招祸的根源，因为“财帛动人心”的缘故。常言有“爬得越高摔得越重”，一个身居高位的人，一旦从金字塔上跌下来就如掉进无底深渊。所以孔子才说：“鄙夫！可与事君也与哉？其未得之也，患得之。既得之，患失之。苟患失之，无所不至矣！”</p>
<p>富豪长者，一旦破产，多因债台高筑被逼而亡身，反而比贫穷的人痛苦。所以，有钱的人比不上贫穷的人无忧无虑。这并不是说富贵可厌而贫贱可爱，实在是因为世人多半知道富贵的利，而不知道其害。仅知道贫贱的苦而不知其乐，明白了贫富的利害得失，就知道富贵不足贪，贫贱亦不足厌。</p>
<p>一次，美国第32届总统富兰克林•罗斯福家中失盗，被盗贼偷去很多东两。他的朋友写信安慰他，罗斯福给朋友写了一封这样的回信：“亲爱的朋友，谢谢你来信安慰我，我现在很平安。感谢上帝。因为：第一，贼偷去的是我的东西，而没有伤害我的生命；第二，贼只偷去我部分东西，而不是全部；第三，最值得庆幸的是，做贼的是他，而不是我。”</p>
<p>知身不是我，烦恼更何侵</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>世人只缘①认得“我”字太真，故多种种嗜好，种种烦恼。前人云：“不复知有我，安知物为贵？”又云：“知身不是我，烦恼更何侵？”真破的②之言也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①缘：因。</p>
<p>②破的（dì）：本指箭射中目标，这里比喻话说得恰当。破，射中；的，射箭的靶子。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>只因世人把自我看得太重要了，才会产生那么多的嗜好和烦恼。古人说：“假如已经不再知道自我的存在，又如何能知道外物的可贵呢？”又说：“能明白连身体也在幻化中，一切都不是我所能掌握所能拥有，那么人世间还有什么烦恼能侵害我呢？”这真是一句切中要害的话呀。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古人的处世哲学，强调无我、无为的多，突出自我、自私的少。所谓耻于言利而突出义，就在于应当灭私欲而存大义。为人处世，太过自私难有朋友，难寻合作者，个人私欲太强，便会带来物欲的不满，带来无穷的烦恼。</p>
<p>晋代高官朱冲小时候家境贫寒，没钱上学读书，只好在家里放牛、种地。村里有一家爱占便宜的邻居，平时总是把牛故意赶到别人家的田里去吃庄稼。朱冲家的地与他家的地离得最近，所以地里的庄稼被吃得最多，啃得乱七八糟。朱冲看到以后不仅不生气，还在收工回家时顺便割些野草，连同那头爱吃庄稼的牛一起，给那家人送去，并且说：“你家人多地少，牲口没有草吃，我给你家送来些草，快喂喂吧！这点草要是不够用，我再去割些来。”那家人一听，真是无地自容，又是惭愧，又是感激，他们对朱冲说：“你待人太宽厚了！你放心，以后我们再也不让牛到别人家的地里吃庄稼了。”</p>
<p>朱冲看到别人家的牛吃自家的庄稼，他没有立即上去拦阻，反而给其割草，送给主人家，表示愿意帮助主人家用草养活牛，终于感动了这家自私霸道的村邻。为人厚道如此，还有什么忍不了，还有什么小事能够烦扰他呢？一身轻松，做事做人都坦然，为官也有好人缘。</p>
<p>猛兽易伏也，人心难降哉</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>眼看西晋之荆榛①，犹矜白②刃；身属北邙③之狐兔，尚惜黄金。语云：“猛兽易伏，人心难降。溪壑易填，人心难满。”信哉！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①荆榛：草木丛生。</p>
<p>②矜白：矜，自夸，白是兵器。</p>
<p>③北邙：洛阳以北有墓地曰北邙，由汉代起即是有名的墓地。《邙山》诗中曰：“北邙山上列坟茔，万古千秋对洛城。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>眼看着武功最盛的西晋，就要发生亡国大祸，变成杂草丛生的荒芜之地，可是一些高官贵族还在那里炫耀自己的武力；亲贵皇族，死后多半都葬在北邙山，身体已属于北邙山陵墓间狐鼠的食物，在世时还何必那样爱惜财富呢？俗谚说：“野兽虽然容易制伏，可是人心却难以降服；沟壑容易填平，人的欲望却难以满足。”这真是一句经验之谈呀！</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一提到“人心难制”，就只想到他人，殊不知最难制服的是自己的心，能自制者则能自胜、胜人，就是勇者。人常说，勇在敢为，勇在无畏。其实，并不是所有敢为与无畏都是真勇，都是可以作为人生依凭的大勇。</p>
<p>齐国有一个叫北宫黝的人就敢为。肌肤被刺，可以毫不颤动，眼睛被戮，都不眨一眨；即使受了一点点侮辱，不管对方是国君还是普通人，他都敢于回击。他把刺杀大国的君主看成是与鞭打卑贱的人一样容易的事。这种敢为之勇，就称不上大勇，而只是一种庸人之勇。这种勇，只要豁出去了，情急之中，傻子也能做到。常言说兔子急了能咬人，但兔子终归是兔子，如果不被逼急，这敢咬人的兔子见了老虎，大约还是要快快缩回它的洞穴里去的。再如孟施舍的无畏。他说：“我对待不能战胜的敌人，就跟对足以战胜的敌人一样。不管面对哪一种，我都勇往直前。假如先估量敌人的力量才前进，先顾虑胜败再交锋，那么，遇上数量众多的敌人就会害怕。所以，我不一定能打胜仗，只是无所畏惧罢了。”孟施舍的勇比北宫黝的勇要强些，但也只能被看作一种匹夫之勇。匹夫之勇能保持一股无所畏惧的盛气，但却常因有了这盛气变得莽撞而不明事理，勇则勇矣，但却无补于事，有时还会因之而坏了事情，残了自身。</p>

<p>③化育：大自然生成万物，这里指本性善良。《礼记•中庸》：“能尽物之性，可以赞天地之化育。”</p>

<p>译文</p>
<p>心中没有风涛波浪，到处都是青山绿树的宜人景象；本性善良宽厚，随时都感觉像鱼儿水中游、鸟儿空中飞那样自由自在。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>生活中我们可能会遇到这样或那样的骗子，每当遇到骗子时我们可能会非常痛恨可恶的骗子。有一位非常有名的运动员，某天赢得了一场比赛，获得了一笔数额可观的奖金。他开车到常去的那家倶乐部吃饭休息，在俱乐部停车场他遇到一个女人。这个女人向运动员诉苦，说她有一个孩子，孩子得了重病，可是她却无力支付昂贵的医疗费用。孩子病得很严重，可能活不了多久。运动员非常同情她，他把自己刚刚获得的那笔奖金送给了女人。几天之后，运动员与朋友在餐厅吃饭，遇到一位老朋友，老朋友和运动员说起遇到一个骗子的事情。他说在倶乐部停车场，他遇到一个女人，这个女子说自己有一个生重病的孩子，但是她却无力支付昂贵医疗费用，以此获得人们同情，收到了不少善心捐款。老朋友说这个女人是个骗子，她骗过了很多人，其实她没结过婚，更没有孩子。运动员听了之后很关心地问：“也就是说没有一个病得快要死去的小孩子？”老朋友回答说：“是的，没有。”运动员很高兴地说：“这真是一个好消息啊。”</p>
<p>心地善良、心胸宽厚的人，看待事情总是看好的一面，钱财乃是身外之物，人的生命才是最可贵的。这个故事中的运动员令人钦佩，当知道自己遇到骗子时，他关心的不是这个骗子如何可恶。他关注的是那个病得要死的小孩子是虚构出来的这件事，他因为不存在这样一个得重病的孩子而非常开心。这是非常善良，心胸宽厚的体现。本性善良的人，能在生活中看到许多宜人景象，即使是在丑陋的事物中，他们也能看出其有光彩的一面。如果心中杂念过多，那么即使遇到良辰美景，也不能静下心来去欣赏。生活中的美景不需要刻意去寻找，只要能使自己心无杂念，心地纯净，保持善良本性，那么自然能感受到生活中的美好。</p>
<p>当年歌舞地，今败砌荒台</p>

<p>狐狸作窝的残垣断壁，野兔奔跑的废亭荒台，这些都是当年歌舞升平的地方；遍地菊花在寒风中颤抖，一片荒草在烟雾中摇曳，这里曾是当年英雄争霸的战场。兴衰成败如此无常，而富贵强弱又在何方呢？每当想到这些，就会使人产生无限感伤而心灰意冷。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>无常歌唱得好：“叹无常，贪财宝，逞刚强，费尽心血命不长。谋财终有祸，逞气定遭殃；富豪英雄客，临危失主张。”</p>
<p>商代最后一位国君纣王，是历史上的暴虐国君中的典型，自以为当王，就可以为所欲为，孰不知，人生无常，天网恢恢，报应不爽。他整天酗酒玩乐，在朝歌修建离宫别馆，修建高大的鹿台和林苑等娱乐场所，搜集狗马奇物、各种鸟兽养在里面，又作“酒池肉林”，日夜和宠妃妲己及一些贵族幸臣在这些娱乐场所饮酒取乐。为了打猎游玩，他们将耕地荒废，让鸟兽自由生长，并想出各种刑罚处罚贵族、侯国首领和人民，榨取财物。为了镇压奴隶的反抗，特制了一种酷刑叫“炮烙之刑”。先用炭火把青铜柱烧得通红，然后叫人光着脚板在上面行走，站不住就掉入火中活活烧死。许多老臣面对纣王的荒淫无道，一再规劝纣王修善行仁，但都无济于事，最终被周武王发兵起义，夺了天下。</p>
<p>历史是无情的，纣王荒淫无道，也只能落个国灭身亡，遗臭万年的可耻下场。然而最能代表“人生无常”思想的，莫过于曹雪芹《红楼梦》中的“好了歌”：“陋室空堂，当年笏满床；衰草枯杨，曾为歌舞场。蛛丝几结满雕梁，绿纱今又（糊）在蓬窗上，说什么胭正浓粉正香，如何两鬃又成霜？昨日黄土陇中埋白骨，今宵红绡帐底卧鸳鸯，金满箱，银满箱，转眼乞丐人皆谤，正叹他人命不长，那知自己归来丧。训有方，保不定日后作强谤，正叹他人命不长，那知自己归来丧。训有方，保不定日后作强梁；择膏梁，谁承望流落在烟花巷；因嫌纱帽小，致使枷锁杠；昨怜破袄寒，今嫌此蟒长。乱烘烘，你方唱罢我登场，反认他乡是故乡；甚荒唐，到头来，都是为他人作嫁衣裳。”</p>

<p>飞蛾夜投火烛是自取灭亡，鸱食鼠是逐臭食腐。这都是为欲所迷，为欲所驱。</p>
<p>后梁末帝时，天下纷乱，出了个以掘墓闻名的节度使温韬。温韬本是京兆华原人，早年以盗墓为生，后来做了凤翔陇右节度使李茂贞的部将，投降后梁，又两度复叛。梁末帝时，他又做到了节度使。温韬为人，贪婪凶狠，目无法纪，在做节度使期间，唐代皇帝的陵寝凡是在他辖区内的，全都被他发掘盗窃遍了。昭陵是唐太宗李世民的陵墓，建筑十分坚固宏伟。温韬派遣军士费尽气力掘开了墓道，进入寝宫，看到里面宫室制作宏大华丽，如同人间的皇宫一样。墓室中间是正寝，东西厢布满了石床，床上石函中放着大铁箱，里面藏的是前世的秘籍图文、书法绘画珍品等等，特别是钟繇、王羲之的真迹，是唐太宗生前最喜爱之物，故嘱以随葬，由于保存恰当，此时纸墨还像新的一样。温韬知道这些都是稀世珍宝，于是就一件不留，全都掠为己有。就这样，唐代皇帝陵墓遭到肆无忌惮的破坏，随葬的大量金银玉器、奇珍异宝，全都被温韬洗劫一空。后唐庄宗灭梁，温韬求降，庄宗大臣郭崇韬就坚决反对接纳，说：“这是个盗掘陵墓的贼寇，罪不可赦！”</p>
<p>可见温韬挖掘皇帝陵寝，就像鸱鸮偏爱吃腐臭的老鼠那样，是多么为人所熟知而厌恶。俗话说：欲有尊卑贪无二致，说的就是像温韬这样的人。</p>
<p>冷观观世人，冷情当世事</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>权贵龙骧①，英雄虎战②，以冷眼视之，如蝇聚膻③，如蚁竞血；是非蜂起，得失猬兴，以冷情当之，如冶化金，如汤⑤消雪。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①龙骧：像龙那样腾飞跳跃。</p>
<p>②虎战：像虎一样激烈争斗。</p>
<p>③膻：膻腥味。</p>
<p>④猬兴：猬毛竖起，比喻事端纷起。猬：刺猬。</p>
<p>⑤汤：热水。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>有权势的达官贵人，像飞龙一般表现气概威武；英雄豪杰像猛虎一样征战，若以冷眼从旁观看他们，就像苍蝇聚集在腥膻上争抢，就如蚂蚁在血泊中争夺一样龌龊不堪；人间的是是非非就宛如群蜂飞舞一般纷乱，得失不断产生宛如刺猬竖起的毛一样密集，而以冷静的头脑去对待它们，就像洪炉熔化金属，又如同热水消融冰雪，化有为无。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古来权贵英雄的功勋伟业固然显赫一时，但以旁观者清的立场观之，他们也不过是如蚁聚膻，如蝇竞血。荣华易逝，好景不常，千百年后，不过也是“滚滚长江东逝水，浪花淘尽英雄，古今多少事，都付笑谈中”罢了。</p>
<p>清代著名画家郑板桥做过两任知县，其书画艺术闻名于世，在为官之时，他刚直和不附权势的品格与他的书画几乎同样出名。郑板桥为一方知县时，常常将爱民之心、为民之举和对老百姓的眷顾之情融入题画诗词之中，当然无不与竹休戚相关，如《潍县署中画竹呈年伯包大中丞括》云：“衙斋卧听萧萧竹，疑是民间疾苦声。些小吾曹州县吏，一枝一叶总关情。”郑板桥做官以民为重，把关心民生疾苦作为己任，常用诗画抨击和揭露贪官酷吏对无辜百姓的无情压榨。因其坚定的为民之举与黑暗的时代格格不入，而得罪了上司和乡绅，无奈之余他愤然辞官回乡。在与百姓临别之际他画竹题诗表明心意：“乌纱掷去不为官，囊橐萧萧两袖寒。写取一枝清瘦竹，秋风江上作渔竿。”诗中将瘦竹的贫寒清高与自己处境心志相连，比喻贴切恰当，更有一番依依不舍的离别之情，情真意切，句句动心，感人至深。郑板桥自此弃官为民，他带走了两袖清风，留下的却是一身正气和百世英明。</p>
<p>今人看来，郑板桥绝不仅仅是一代才人，更是后世为民之官的楷模，为了百姓利益，郑板桥毫不顾忌自己乌纱的存留。现在赏阅郑板桥的竹之诗画，那纤纤素竹，枝劲叶密，不朽诗篇，字正腔圆，足以为其“拳拳为民之举，殷殷爱民之情”的艺术再现。</p>
<p>徇绝欲俱苦，听吾自修持</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>真空不空①，执②相非真，破相亦非真，问世尊③如何发付④？在世出世，徇⑤欲是苦，绝欲亦是苦，听吾侪善自修持。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①真空不空：佛家语。真空是不为任何事物所迷惑但留一纯真。即佛教认为达到涅槃境界时，就离开了一切迷情所见之象，故叫真空。而“不空”是涅槃境界，是超脱世间一切烦恼的清净境界，是对生死诸苦及其要源的彻底断灭。因为这个境界绝对真实，故称不空。</p>
<p>②执：执着。</p>
<p>③世尊：释迦牟尼佛。《佛说十号经》：“天、人、凡圣出世间，咸皆尊重，故曰世尊。”</p>
<p>④发付，发表意见。</p>
<p>⑤徇：追求。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>不受任何事物的迷惑保留一片纯真，心中却无示排除所有物象；执著于事物外在形相并不能看清事物的本质，同样地，破除事物外在形相也不能看清事物的本质，请问佛怎样解释这个道理？置身于世又想超脱世俗，拚命追求欲望是痛苦，断绝一切欲望也是痛苦，如何应付痛苦，就只能靠自己领悟修行了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>佛教说真空而妙有。《般若心经》说：“色即是空，空即是色。”天地万物各种形相所以历然显现，实在是因为各种因缘而显现的色相，原来根本没有实体。例如房屋是用土木竹石构成的，本来根本没有所谓“屋”的实体。我们人类的身体也如此，人生本来是由地火水风构成，地水火风一旦分散身体就立刻消亡，这不就是空迹象了吗？因此才有“色即是空”。但是从另一方面来看，屋和身虽然是空的，可是显现在眼前的却是屋和肉，又怎能说它是空而无有呢？所以才又说“空即是色”。</p>
<p>如此循环下去，万有都是空，空也就是万有。能了悟“色即是空，空即是色”之理，就不可不把这空和有很恰当地加以应用，但是空和有最容易偏于一端。所谓真空并非离开有的空，而是“色即是空”的空。执著于万物的形相，而认为有其实体的当然跟真理不相契合，但是如果破形相而坠入虚无的偏空，也是违背了真理。反之如果偏于空和有的任何一方，就都算是违背真理的邪见。然而世尊对这个问题持如何意见呢？问题的答案就是“在世而超世”，这乃是佛教中的最上乘教义。而放纵人欲固然是一种大苦恼，不过完全弃绝人欲也未尝不是苦恼。例如置身火焰之中就会被烧死，但是如果完全跟火焰隔绝也会被冻死，所以对火最好是不即不离善加运用。同理，假如从人欲陷入着相，那弃绝人欲就会堕入破相，两方都不免于苦恼，所以最好是不陷不弃不着不破，努力修持自己，由浅入深而悟得此真理。</p>
<p>春景山水图</p>
<p>好名利不殊，焦声思无异</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>烈士①让千乘②，贪夫争一文，人品星渊③也，而好名不殊好利；天子营家国，乞人号饔飧④，位分霄壤⑤也，而焦思何异焦⑥声？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①烈士：重视道义节操的人。</p>
<p>②千乘：古代的一车四马称为一乘。</p>
<p>③星渊：星星高拴在天空。渊，深潭，形容差别极大。</p>
<p>④饔飧（yōng sūn）：泛指食物。饔，早餐。飧，晚餐。《京本通俗小说•拗相公》：“况且民穷财尽，百姓饔飧不饱，没闲钱去养马骡。”</p>
<p>⑤霄壤：比喻相差极远。霄，天；壤，地。</p>
<p>⑥焦：苦。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个忠义的人，能把千乘兵车的大国拱手让人；一个贪得无厌的人，连一文钱也要争抢。人的品德真是有天壤之别，而喜欢沽名钓誉和一个贪得无厌的人在本质上并没什么不同。当皇帝治理的是国家，当乞丐为的是讨一日三餐，身份地位确实天壤之别，但是当皇帝的焦思苦虑和当乞弓的哀声乞讨，其痛苦情形又有什么不同呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>贫富有差距，但忙碌却是一样的。富商邑贾痛苦，所愁的是资金怎样周转，所担心的是公司的兴衰；穷人痛苦，所愁的是一日三餐的有无，两者苦的性质与程度在意义上却是完全相同的。同理好名之人跟好利之人，表面观之似乎好名之人品质较高，其实两者本质完全相同。孟子说：“好名之人，能让千乘之国；苟非其人，箪食豆羹见于色。”人各有痛苦，追求有追求的失落，富贵有富贵的难处，安贫有安贫的烦恼。去掉私心杂念，保持平衡宁静，确非易事。</p>
<p>人生在世，都面对着一个共同的生存问题，大家在求生存的大前提之下，从事的行业固然各有不同，出发点则是一致的。因此，人不应有贵贱之分，谁也没有资格轻视任何人的职业不够光鲜，谁也不用为别人轻视的眼光而有低人一等的感觉。</p>
<p>性天须澄澈，心地勿沉迷</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>性天①澄澈，即饥餐渴饮，无非康济②身心；心地沉迷，纵谈禅演偈③，总是播弄④精魄。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①性天：天性、本性。</p>
<p>②康济：本指安民济众，此处作调剂身心讲，据《书经.蔡仲之命》：“康济小民。”</p>
<p>③谈禅演偈：谈论禅理，推敲佛偈。偈，佛家所唱词句。</p>
<p>④播弄：颠倒翻弄。《元曲•梧桐雨》中有：“如今明皇已昏盹，杨国忠、李林甫拔弄朝政。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个本性纯真的人饿了就吃渴了就喝，本性纯真的人，饿了吃渴了喝，无非是为了调剂身心。一个心地沉迷物欲的人，即使整天讨论佛经，谈论禅理，不过是在白白耗费自己的精力而已。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一个真正信佛的人不一定要落发为僧，出家修行的人也不一定是好和尚，所以凡事不要拘泥于形式而应讲求实质。例如颜渊“一箪食，一瓢饮，居陋巷，人不堪其忧，回也不改其乐”的安贫乐道精神，就是表面生活虽然很清苦，实际精神却极为快乐。又如梁武帝萧衍虽然平日吃斋念佛，而且三舍其身于同泰寺出家，可是由于他沉迷于权力和声色物欲太深，最后遭侯景之乱而饿死台城。所以说，如果做什么事都只求形式而不讲实质不看结果，是很难见到成效的。</p>
<p>《列子•汤问》篇中，列子说：“可以出生便出生，这是自然的福佑；可以死亡便死亡，这也是自然的福佑。可以出生却不出生，这是自然的处罚；可以死亡却不死亡，这也是自然的处罚。可以出生，可以死亡，得着出生，得着死亡，是有的；但是不可以出生，不可以死亡，有的出生，有的死亡，也是有的。出生的出生，死亡的死亡，不是外物使它这样，也不是自己要这样，都是命运，人的聪明才力对这毫无办法。所以说，杳然没有边际，是自然之道，自己在聚会；漠然没有界限，是自然之道，自身在运动。天地纵大，对它不能触犯；圣人智者虽然有才有力，对它不能干涉；鬼魅无形而似乎有势，不能对它欺哄。只有自然不声不响使它成功，使它平静而安宁，使它得到欢迎。”</p>
<p>列子的话，旨在告诉人一个可循的门径，不可痴迷于形式。一个人只要能悟得真理，便能自见天机。反之，物欲不能扫除，心中始终为世相所迷，欲参任何圣贤哲理，也不过是自欺欺人罢了。</p>
<p>人心有真境，忘虑得以游</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人心有真境①，非丝非竹②，而自恬愉③，不烟不茗④，而自清芬⑤。须念净境虚空，虑忘形释⑥，才得以游衍⑦其中。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①真境：真实的境界，觉悟的妙境。</p>
<p>②丝竹：乐器。</p>
<p>③恬愉：恬淡愉快。</p>
<p>④茗：茶。</p>
<p>⑤清芬：清香。</p>
<p>⑥形释：躯体的解说。释，解脱。</p>
<p>⑦游衍：逍遥游乐。衍：漫延，扩展。《后汉书•桓帝纪》：“流衍四方。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人的心中有一个真实美妙的境界，没有音乐来调剂生活也会感到舒适愉快，不需要焚香烹茶也能使满室散着清香。只要能使心中有真实感受，而且思想纯洁意境空灵，就会忘掉一切烦恼身无束缚，如此才能使自己逍遥游乐在这样的美妙境界当中。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人心是本乎天道的，应该心无阻碍，优游自得。老庄所谓的清净无为，古人所谓的放浪形骸，都是悠游这一妙境的法门。任何人在参禅悟道的第一步，断绝名利及物欲，然后才能得以现出真如之性。</p>
<p>一天，孟子和梁惠王在一个池塘边观景。梁惠王环顾着周围的鸿雁麋鹿，面呈得意之色，对孟子说：“有道德的人也享受这种快乐吗？”孟子回答说：“只有有道德的人才能够享受这一种快乐，没有道德的人，即使有这种快乐，他也享受不了。”——有德者方能有乐。人生的快乐有多种，但归根到底，真正的能使人感到充实的快乐，应该是那种无所挂碍的精神的舒展，是那种了无愧怍的心灵的放松，是那种胸怀坦荡的乐天知命。</p>
<p>俗眼观世异，道眼观世常</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天地中万物，人伦中万情，世界中万事，以俗眼①观，纷纷各异；以道眼②观，种种是常，何须分别，何须取舍！</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①俗眼：一般人的眼光。</p>
<p>②道眼：超越世俗的眼光。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>天地间的一切事物，人世间的一切错综复杂的情感，以及世界上不断发生的种种事情，如果用世俗眼光去观察，是千差万别各不相同的；如果用超越世俗的眼光去观察，就会发现事物的本质都是一样的，没有什么区别，又何必要有分别？何必要有取舍呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一般人看人都是要分个三六九等的，而佛家说众生平等。一般人难舍爱恨情仇，佛家却教我们淡看爱恨。世间万物平等，不需区分，何来取舍。</p>
<p>《吕氏春秋•贵公》说：阴阳气候，甘露时雨，不择物而变，不私物而降，这才是公的气象。《汉书•张良传》上说：刘邦夺得天下之后，先封了二十多个大功臣，其他的人日夜争功，很不安宁。有一天，刘邦在洛阳南宫看见下面的人，三个一团，五个一伙，在那里窃窃私议。刘邦把张良找来，问那些人在干什么，张良说他们正在谋反。刘邦大惊，急问为什么。张良说：陛下您一介布衣与他们一起南征北战，今天得了天下，您自己贵为天子，所封的都是萧何、曹参等与您亲近的人，而所杀的又都是您平时不喜欢的，所以他们既担心自己能否得封，又担心哪一点逆忤了您被杀，人心不安，才有反意。刘邦很担忧地要张良出主意，张良教刘邦把自己最不喜欢的人找出来，论功行赏，让群臣看到所有封赏都是无偏私的，都是秉公持正的。于是刘邦封赏自己最讨厌的雍齿。群臣见雍齿被封，原来的担心自然消解，就都一心一意拥护刘邦做了皇帝。</p>
<p>汉初人心、政治的安定局面，就是这样由一个“公”字奠定，看来众臣也不过是俗人而已。</p>
<p>缠脱在自心，心了见真境</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>缠脱①只在自心，心了②则屠肆③糟糠④居然净土。不然纵一琴一鹤，一花一竹，嗜好虽清，魔障终在。语云：“能休尘境为真境，未了僧家是俗家。”</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①缠脱：摆脱束缚。缠，缠缚；脱，解脱。</p>
<p>②心了：心中了悟。</p>
<p>③屠肆：杀牲卖肉的店铺。肆，店铺。《后汉书•王充传》：“家贫无书，常游洛阳市肆，阅所卖书。”</p>
<p>④糟糠：酒店，本意酒糟，谷皮。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>想解脱世俗的纠缠，关键是看自己的内心，如果心性清净了悟，即使屠宰铺子与酿酒家也是洁净的极乐世界。要不然，即使终日与琴鹤相伴，种花草竹木为乐，喜好虽然清净淡泊，但束缚身心，妨碍得道的魔障仍然存在。古人说：“能休尘境为真境，未了僧家走俗家”，此言之意为只要能断除一切烦恼邪念，则不论身处何处，皆是真理存在的境界。要是不能了悟红尘是非，即使出家深修，仍止于俗人的境界。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人心的执念，决定了一个人是否能自尘俗诸苦中解脱，而觉得永恒祥和。只要能满心而发，真诚了悟，则不论外在环境为何，终可心静思澄。</p>
<p>隋唐时期，王绩很小便跟随兄长，常读《论语》、《周易》、《老子》、《庄子》等经典文著，结交天下有志之士。据传，王绩喝酒，五斗不醉。凡请他喝酒的人，不管其身份高低，只要他合意的，他都有请必到，从不拒绝。他对人品不好的人，并不贪杯，拒绝同饮。为了弄清酿酒的历史和酿制的方法，王绩居然走南闯北，收集了夏朝以来各种酒，尤其是杜康酒的配方和工艺流程，写成一部关于酿酒史的书籍。</p>
<p>纵观王绩的一生，他两度出仕，两度归隐，做过隋炀帝的六合县县丞、唐太宗的太乐丞，唐高祖也曾召他到门下省等候任命。身在官场，心在醉乡，可见王绩极其厌烦封建礼教，不喜欢受礼节的束缚，所以他虽然当官数次，却是每次都以各种理由辞官归隐，追求得精神上的解脱。</p>

<p>以我转物者，大地尽逍遥</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>以我转①物者，得固不喜，失亦不忧，大地尽属逍遥②；以物役③我者，逆固生憎，顺亦生爱，一毫便生缠缚④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①转：支配。</p>
<p>②逍遥：徜徉自适。诗经：“河上乎逍遥”。</p>
<p>③役：役使，奴役。陶渊明《归去来兮辞》：“既自以心为形役，奚惆怅而独悲。”</p>
<p>④缠缚：困扰、束缚。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>以我为中心支配一切事物的人，成功了固然不觉得高兴，失败了也不至于忧愁，这样没有羁伴和挂牵地做人真是逍遥自在；以物为中心而受物欲奴役的人，遭遇逆境时心中产生怨恨，处于顺境时产生欢喜之心，一点细微的事就能把自己束缚住。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>六祖慧能禅师说“心迷法华转，心悟转法华”，以自我为中心万物都为我所用，失了一物可另取一物，败了一事可另创一事，尽可海阔天空而无忧无虑。反之以物为中心的人就患得患失，做任何事胸襟都不够开朗，结果才会弄得事事局促。</p>
<p>齐襄公无道，公子小白、公子纠逃亡在外。后小白抢在前头回去做了国君，便兴兵逼死公子纠，夺了齐国君位，即历史上的齐桓公。管仲作为公子纠的师傅和臣子，在公子纠死后没有自杀殉主，相反投靠了公子纠的对手小白，做了桓公的宰相，把齐国治理得井井有条。</p>
<p>孔子极尊崇管仲这种富国利民，以身守节的气度，称这才是大道、大仁。连准备在费地谋反的公山拂扰招孔子去帮忙，孔子觉得可能在那里推行周文公、周武王的治国之道，于是便起身去了。孟子称孔子为圣之时者，说他一切根据客观实际而定，为坚持和贯彻自己的理想，可以仕则仕，可以止则止，可以久则久，可以速则速。这便是“以我转物者，得固不喜，失亦不忧，大地尽属逍遥”的境界吧！</p>
<p>思生前死后，超物游象先</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>试思未生之前有何象貌，又思既死之后有何景色①，则万念灰冷，一性②寂然③，自可超物外而游象先④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①景色：景况形色。</p>
<p>②一性：一心，全心。</p>
<p>③寂然：宁静。易经：“寂然不动。”</p>
<p>④象先：超越各种形象。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>试想一下，人在还没有出生之前有什么样的相貌，再想一想人死之后又成为怎样的模样，想到这些，原先的各种念头就都会像冷灰那样熄灭。内心只要保持纯真、宁静，就可以既超脱现存的事物，又能遨游于天地之间。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>寒山说：欲识生死譬，且将冰水比。水结即成冰，冰消返成水。已死心应生，出生还复死。冰水不相伤，生死还双美。我从哪里来？要到哪里去？种种对生与死反反复复的苦苦叩问，不由得让红尘中人迷惘的心一阵战栗。</p>
<p>张良是汉初开国元勋，尽管如此，他十分了解刘邦多疑好忌、冷酷无情的另一面：在关系到自身安危时他毫无怜悯之心，为维护个人权力也会六亲不认。所以，在消灭了项羽、稳定了汉王朝之后，张良自动退出政治舞台。</p>
<p>刘邦定都长安后，张良也在长安建立了府第，任太子少傅。平时张良总称自己身体有病，很少参加朝中活动，对国家大事也不发表意见，有的时候甚至一年多都不外出活动，整日闭门待在家里，谢绝一切客人，苦学“导引”之术，炼服丹药，不吃食物，修炼气功。实际上，张良是以学习神仙的道术，即将脱离凡尘进入仙境为借口以摆脱政务，过着自由自在的隐居生活；他的辟谷导引，也不过是健身术而已。这种既在朝中有职务而又不过问政治的处世方式被称为“朝隐”。</p>
<p>权势不一定给人带来幸福。汉王朝的江山虽然已经打下，但统治集团内部明争暗斗，你倾我轧仍然十分激烈，稍有不慎，就会卷入残酷的政治斗争中，轻则落得身败名裂，重则殃及家人的性命。张良不仅在处理各种复杂问题上，表现出过人的智慧，而且在功成名就时不贪功争利，以谦退保全功名的高尚品质，难能可贵，是明智之举。因此，常怀一颗平常心，拿得起便能放得下。</p>

<p>注释</p>
<p>①优人：伶人，戏子。</p>
<p>②妍：美丽、美好。</p>
<p>③毫端：毫笔之端。</p>
<p>④雌雄：胜败。《史记•项羽本纪》：“愿与汉王挑战决雄雄。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>演戏的伶人在脸上搽胭脂涂口红，一切的美丑都靠笔端化妆来修饰，可是转眼之间歌舞完毕曲终人散，方才的美丑又都到哪里去了呢？下棋的人在棋盘上激烈竞争，你争我夺，靠棋子的着落一决胜负，可是转眼间棋局完了子收人散，刚才的胜败又到哪里去了呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古人有云：世事如棋，起手当思好结局；人生若戏，开场须要美团圆。其实心驻青风明月，即是好结局，即是美团圆。人不过棋局一盘，掌上千秋史，世上风云人，喜怒哀乐悲欢离合，尔虞我诈你争我夺，好比演戏一个个粉墨登场。</p>
<p>战国中期，秦强赵弱。当秦昭王听说赵王得到著名的和氏璧后，就向赵王表示要用十五座城市交换和氏璧。赵国君臣都明白这是秦国的诡计，但又不敢正面拒绝。蔺相如自告奋勇带着和氏璧到秦国去，并表示一定要完璧归赵。秦昭王见了和氏璧后，根本不谈用城池交换之事，蔺相如就假称和氏璧有斑点，从昭王手中要回了和氏璧并要求昭王斋戒五日后，再隆重地接受和氏璧，暗地里却安排人带着和氏璧，偷偷地回赵国去了。五天过后，蔺相如面对秦王君臣慷慨陈词，历数秦代各君主不守信义，坦白承认和氏璧已让人带回国了，秦王假若是真心，就请先将十五座城池划归赵国，否则自己就只能以死来维护赵国的尊严。秦王君臣见和氏璧已不在相如手中，又考虑到现在还不宜与赵国破裂，于是就以隆重的礼节招待蔺相如，然后让他回归赵国。</p>

<p>解读</p>
<p>人无私心，才能让万物依其本性生发，而以“民胞物与”的胸怀，视天地为大家的天地，江山为众人的江山，于是才能就有限之身达到彻底了悟的境界。</p>
<p>伊尹是商汤时期的一个贤人。起先，他居住在莘国郊外的荒野中自耕自食，以尧、舜之道为乐，专心于修养身心，如果不合道义的，纵使以天下的财富为他的俸禄，都不能使他动心。商汤曾几次派人带着礼物去聘请他，他都平静地拒绝了。</p>
<p>不久，他却完全改变了态度。他说：我居住在这荒野之中，以尧舜之道作为我个人的快乐，为什么我不可以使现在的君子做尧舜一样的君子呢？为什么我不可以使现在的百姓成为尧舜时代一样的百姓呢？为什么不可以凭我的努力使尧舜盛世在今天再现呢？上天生育了人民，就是要使先知先觉者来使后知后觉者有所觉悟，而我，正是百姓中的先知先觉者，我就得用尧舜之道去使现在的百姓有所觉悟。我不去使他们觉悟，还有谁能担此重任呢？在这时的伊尹看来，普天下的百姓中如果有一个人没有沾上尧舜之道的润泽，便有如是自己把他们推入深渊一样。于是，他把匡救天下的重任担挑在肩上，主动来到汤的宫中，辅佐汤讨伐夏桀，拯救百姓。</p>

<p>人生是傀儡，要把柄在手</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人生原是傀儡①，只要把柄②在手，一线不乱，卷舒自由，行止在我，一毫不受他人提掇③，便超此场中矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①傀儡：木偶戏中的木头人，用在此处比喻人受操纵没有自由。</p>
<p>②把柄：器物上的柄。</p>
<p>③提掇：提拉，操纵。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人生原本是受控制的傀儡，只要掌握住提拉傀儡的把柄，一线不乱，卷起展开自由，行动停止都由我决定，丝毫不受别人控制，这样就能超脱俗世了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人们都渴望自由，匈牙利爱国诗人裴多菲有一首诗引发很多人的共鸣，“生命诚可贵，爱情价更高，若为自由故，两者皆可抛。”更有人喊出了“不自由，毋宁死”的口号。虽然人们渴望自由，但是在现实生活中却时常感觉到不自由。人生没有绝对的自由，自由是在掌握各种规律，明白世间各种道理的情况下，对于人生的一种明智把握。人生来有很多东西都不能选择，比如人不能选择自己的出生地，也不能选择自己的性别等。但是这并不代表我们没有自由，在很多事情上我们同样拥有选择的权利。有人选择积极努力，追求功名利禄；有人选择追求道德完善；也有人选择探索求知、追求真理。</p>
<p>中国古代的读书人，有出仕为官的人。也有一些人读书只为爱好读书，一生不出仕为官，保持高洁，不贪恋荣华富贵与功名利禄，超脱世俗自由自在地生活。三国时候的田畴就是这样的人。田畴喜欢读书，擅长剑术。当时幽州牧刘虞，德高望重，袁绍想推刘虞当皇帝。刘虞拒绝后，想派人去长安向汉献帝表明自己忠心。这时有人向刘虞推荐田畴，田畴接受了这一任务，带了几个人历经艰辛，终于到达长安。汉献帝看到田畴非常感动，因为那时候朝廷衰微，知道还有人忠于朝廷，皇帝自是欢喜。他当即封田畴为官，要田畴留下来。田畴没有接受朝廷的封赏，他赶回幽州复命。幽州牧刘虞却已被公孙瓒所杀，田畴在刘虞墓前诵读皇帝回复的圣旨，大哭祭拜刘虞。公孙瓒把田畴关起来，后来又释放了他。田畴获得自由身后，带着家人与愿意跟随他的同乡族人，进入山区隐居。他带着大家耕种垦荒，几年的时间，吸引了众多百姓来此居住。当时战火连天，百姓苦不堪言。田畴隐居的地方就像是一片世外桃源，百姓安居乐业和睦相处。袁绍曾派人请田畴出去做官，田畴婉言拒绝。后来曹操出征乌丸，由于不熟悉地形，派人请田畴当向导。田畴答应为向导，同时为曹操出谋划策。有人不明白田畴为何同意，田畴解释乌丸是外族，如果听任其发展壮大，将来必然会产生危害，故此借曹操大军来消灭外敌。曹操大军击败乌丸主力，曹操论功行赏，封田畴为亭侯，田畴拒不接受。他继续回去耕作为生，直到病逝。</p>
<p>造化与人心，混合无间也</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>当雪夜月天，心境①便尔清澈；遇春风和气，意界②亦自冲融。造化③人心，浑合无间。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①心境：情绪心情。</p>
<p>②意界：心中意境。</p>
<p>③造化：创造培育，这里指自然。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在雪花飘落的夜晚与明月当空的时候，人的心情也会变得清澈明朗；沐浴着春风和气，人的情绪也跟着变得轻松起来，大自然与人的心灵浑然一体，紧密融合。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>自古以来，文人墨客多喜欢歌颂春天，为秋天伤感。在他们笔下，春天是美好的象征，春天代表了勃勃生机。秋天则是一片萧索，是可悲可伤的。将自己的心情带入季节中，虽然有浓厚的个人感情色彩，但自然界变化确实对人心情有影响。洒满月光的夜晚与雪花飘落大地披上银装的夜晚，往往能使人的心情也跟着清朗起来。有了雪，再加上那不畏寒冷的梅花，往往使诗人诗兴大发。就是不会吟诗作对的人，对此良辰美景，往往也变得诗情画意起来。有首雪梅诗这样写道：“梅雪争春未肯降，骚人搁笔费评章。梅须逊雪三分白，雪却输梅一段香。”雪花的洁白与梅花的幽香，格外受文人们推崇。乌云密布、草木摇落、飞沙走石的天气，往往能使人情绪低落。自然界的事物，影响人的性情，自然环境影响人的性格。因此道家与佛家修行，总是要找一个清幽的环境。</p>
<p>人与自然息息相通，紧密相关。老子说：“人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。”人的生存依赖于自然，人死后又回归于自然。人的气息与自然相通，一呼一吸离不开自然。人心与自然，本是浑合无间的，人顺应自然，可达天人合一，体悟自然之真意。我们在生活中，往往处于一个被钢筋水泥包围的世界中，所以很多时候我们希望能与大自然亲密接触，回到自然当中，洗刷身上的尘土。这也是由于人本身就是大自然的一部分，人天性中就有爱好自然的本质。人与自然本就是息息相通的。</p>
<p>山居胸次清，触物皆佳思</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>山居胸次①清洒，触物皆有佳思。见野鹤孤云②，而起超绝之想；遇清泉白石，而动澡雪③之思；抚老桧寒梅，而劲节与之挺立；侣沙鸥麋鹿④，而机心与之顿忘。若一入尘寰⑤，无论物不相关，即此身亦属旒赘⑥矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①次：中。</p>
<p>②野鹤孤云：自由自在不受束缚之物。刘长卿《关分外上人》诗有“孤云将野鹤，岂向人间伍。”</p>
<p>③澡雪：澡是沐浴，雪在此处当动词用，作洗涤解，澡雪是指除去一切杂念保持纯洁的心灵。《庄子•知北游》有：“澡雪而精神。”</p>
<p>④麋鹿：麋，大鹿，性温柔。《孟子•梁惠王上》：“顾鸿雁麋鹿”。</p>
<p>⑤寰：世界。</p>
<p>⑥旒：多而无用的意思。旒是旗下所垂之穗，引申为多余的装饰物。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>隐居在山间胸怀自然开朗洒脱，所接触的事物自然都能引起佳思；看见孤云野鹤，就会引起超尘脱俗的观念；遇到山谷溪间的流泉，就会引起洗洁一切世俗杂念的思想；抚摸耸立在风霜中的老桧寒梅，心中不由会涌起效法它们威武不屈的刚毅气节；终年与温和的沙鸥和麋鹿在一起，勾心斗角的邪念就会全消。假如再度走回烦嚣的都市，即使不跟各种声色环境接触，终会觉得自己就像旗帜的飘带而毫无用处。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>环境造人。在现代社会，回归自然的呼声很是强烈，因为在嘈杂喧嚣的都市生活久了，回到山清水秀的山野自会心旷神怡，气朗身轻，更何况修身养性的人了。在人际间争斗久了，即使反感也会染上些习气；在大自然中陶冶惯了，和自然万物天天在一起，自有一派仙风道骨的样子，而再回到尘嚣之中便会处处不适应。有一个好环境会对修省身心帮助不少。</p>
<p>不落世情窠，在世出世法</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>世态有炎凉，而我无嗔喜①；世味有浓淡，而我无欣厌。一毫不落世情窠臼②，便是在世出世法也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①嗔喜：喜怒。嗔，生气。</p>
<p>②窠臼：陈旧老套的格式。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人情世故中虽然有冷热，可是我的心中却没有愤怒与欢喜。人世滋味有浓淡，可是我的心中却没有高兴或厌烦。丝毫不落入人情世态的老套子中，这便是身在俗世红尘中却能超脱俗世的方法。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>面对世俗的争端，要保持一颗平静的心是难能可贵的。特别是在某些方面做出成绩的时候，很多的诱惑都会随之而来，如何坚持自己的德行和操守，拒绝诱惑便是困难之处。</p>
<p>郑板桥家境贫寒，可他人穷志不短，决心苦读百家书，将来有所成就。当时，盛行读“八股”、写“八股”、画“八股”、说“八股”的风气，而郑板桥却不人云亦云、追求形式。他无书不读，各取所长，在写作、作画、书法、篆刻等方面，逐渐形成一种清新活泼的风格。</p>
<p>考中秀才以后，郑板桥省吃俭用，接连参加了几次大考，却都名落孙山。这并非因为他才学不够，而是由于他没有靠山。郑板桥不得不挤出时间来作些书画，拿到市场上去卖，以维持生计和学业。但是，像他这样的无名小辈，作品很少有人问津，有时只能半卖半送，换几文钱聊以度日。在这样的逆境中，郑板桥深切感受到了人情淡薄，世态炎凉。</p>
<p>无论环境怎样艰苦，郑板桥对于自己的学业没有丝毫懈怠。他更加坚定了自己的志向，加倍勤奋，钻研诗词书画，终于创造出了别开生面、令人耳目一新的文风、诗风、画风和别具一格的书法、篆刻艺术。他的诗、画和书法，被人们称为“三绝”。</p>
<p>静中念澄澈，见心之真体</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>静中念虑澄澈①，见心之真体②；闹中气象③从容，识心之真机；淡中意趣冲夷④，得心之真味。观心证道⑤，无如此三者。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①澄澈，河水清澈见底。王献之《镜湖帖》：“镜湖澄澈，清流泻注。”</p>
<p>②真体：本体。</p>
<p>③气象：气度、气概。</p>
<p>④冲夷：谦虚和乐。冲，谦虚、淡泊；夷，和乐。</p>
<p>⑤证道：参证之道。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>安静的时候，人的心绪才会像秋水一般清澈，这时才能发现人性的真正本源，悠闲的时候，人的气概才会像晴空白云一般舒畅悠闲，这时才能发现人性的真正灵魂；平淡的时候，人的内心才会像平静无波的湖水一般谦虚和蔼，这时才能获得人生的真正乐趣。要想观察人生的真正道理，莫过于这三种方式了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>诸葛亮用“宁静以致远，淡泊以明志”两句话来作为他的座右铬，借以磨炼他淡泊明志的心胸和恢宏辽阔的气度。从古至今，许多有志之士修身养性同样尊奉这句名言。</p>
<p>东汉时，郭泰到汝南去拜访袁奉，相见后，连车子都未停稳，交谈一会儿就离开了。而去拜望黄宪，则是整日交谈乃至住了两晚。别人问郭泰这是为什么？郭泰讲：“袁奉的气质才学，就如同流水一样，虽然清澈却很容易酌取。而黄宪的气质才学，如同千顷碧波一样深广，平静安定时不会清亮透彻；搅乱鼓荡时又不浑浊，真是深不可测。”赞扬黄宪才学十分高深。朝廷也曾屡次以孝廉的名义征召黄宪做官，黄宪全都拒绝。太尉陈蕃、周举对黄宪的人品才学也十分钦佩，常常说：“一月之间不与黄宪交谈，浅俗的念头就会萌生。”</p>
<p>反观在物质文明发达的今天，人们竞相追求享受，汲汲于物欲，人与人之间的利害冲突愈来愈为尖锐，人心愈趋于卑靡，而物质已反客为主，大有统治人类之势。人类如欲免于物质的奴役，惟有返璞归真，有淡泊宁静的胸襟。</p>
<p>鱼得水忘水，识此超物累</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鱼得水逝①，而相忘乎水；鸟乘风飞，而不知有风。识此可以超物累，可以乐②天机。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①逝：行、游。</p>
<p>②乐：导受。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>鱼在水中优哉游哉地游着，但是它们本身并没有在水中的感觉，鸟借风力在空中自由自在地翱翔，但是它们却不知道自己置身风中。人若能认清这个道理，就可以超然置身于物欲的诱惑之外，享受人生的乐趣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>鱼在水中优哉游哉地游着，但是它们本身并没有在水中的感觉，鸟借风力在空中自由自在地翱翔，但是它们却不知道自己置身风中。宏智禅师曾说：“水清澈地鱼行迟，空阔透天鸟飞杳。”道一禅师也说：“鸟虽飞去飞回，但不忘其道路。”人如果能超脱物外不为外物所系累，就能如鸢飞鱼跃享受那天然妙机的乐趣了。</p>
<p>庄子看到鱼在水中游，很羡慕地说“乐哉鱼也”。鸟跟鱼能逍遥自在，是因为它们除了生理上的欲望要求之外，没有像人类那么多的情欲物欲。人生在世不只是为了活着，仅仅为了生存而来到人世就太可悲了。也正因为有知识，有理想，有追求，才会经常陷入苦恼。有人认为，要想控制欲望消灭苦恼，唯一的办法就是要能知足，能知足就可使精神愉快。知足是相对的，无止境的贪图是可怜的，但无条件的知足也变成虚妄，好比心静，静至只看到自己的内心，而看不到外部世界，自我封闭，孤陋寡闻，就谈不上真正的快乐。因此，人生最大的快乐，只有在心静自然中获得。</p>

<p>林间松韵①，石上泉声，静里听来，识天地自然鸣佩②；草际烟光③，水心云影，闲中观出，见乾坤最妙文章。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①松韵：风吹松林发出的响声。</p>
<p>②鸣佩：佩玉的响声。佩：系在衣带上作装饰用的玉。李白《感兴八首•其二》：“解佩欲西去。”</p>
<p>③烟光：迷蒙的景色。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>风掠过森林，使苍松发出象海涛般的乐章；泉水溅落在岩石上，使岩石发出阵阵冲击声，静静凝听，便可以认识自然界的和谐声音。江边的棵棵芦苇，原野尽头上升起的迷蒙烟雾，水中央倒映的白云美景，悠闲看去，便能领略到天地间最美妙的景色。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>所说的俗人，就是脑中充满物欲，一般所说的雅士，就是胸中充满恬淡，因而山川林泉，在俗人眼中了无趣味，然而在雅士看来，却到处充满了诗情画意。俗人仅知道琴瑟笙箫的乐器，却不知道松韵泉声全是乐章。俗人仅知道用笔墨写在纸上的是文字，却不知道烟光云影到处都是文章。如果能对起于草边上的霞光和照在水中的云月加以眺望，便能看到乾坤中最好的文章和最好的图画了。</p>
<p>在“王与马，共天下”的东晋时期，王氏是高级的士族。王导、王敦家族的子弟，都当上了大小的官员，他们大多数是庸庸碌碌的官僚，但在这些人当中也出了一个我国历史上有名的书法家，他就是王羲之。</p>
<p>王羲之从小喜爱写字。据说他平时走路的时候，也随时用手指比画着练字，日子一久，连衣服都划破了。经过勤学苦练，王羲之的书法达到很高的水平。因为出身士族，加上才华出众，朝廷中的公卿大臣都推荐王羲之做官。他做过刺史，也当过右军将军（人们也称他王右军），后来又在会稽郡做官。他不爱住在繁华的京城，见到会稽的风景秀丽，非常喜爱，一有空就和朋友们一起游览山水。有一次，王義之和他的朋友在会稽郡山阴的兰亭举行宴会。大家一面喝酒，一面写诗。最后由王羲之当场挥笔，写了一篇文章纪念这次宴会，这就是有名的《兰亭集序》。那幅由王羲之亲笔书写的《兰亭集序》，历来被认为是我国书法艺术的珍品。</p>

<p>解读</p>
<p>生活中并不缺乏美，只是缺少发现美的眼睛。就如同，生活中并不缺少情趣，只是欠缺体会情趣的心灵。这就如同江河的水一直不停地流动，但是两岸的人却听不到流水的声音，这样反而能发现闹中取静的真趣；山峰虽然很高，却不妨碍白云的流动，这种景观可使人悟出从有我进入无我境界中的玄机。</p>
<p>汉代大文学家蔡邕不仅在汉赋史传上有很高的成就，音乐的造诣也十分高超，尤其是他对琴的演奏和感悟能力更是超群。乐器史上十分有名的“焦尾琴”，就是在蔡邕手中诞生，这和他超绝的辨音能力密不可分。</p>
<p>有一次，蔡邕在家乡陈留闲居，邻人准备了酒食招待久未还乡的蔡邕，还说要和他一起探讨琴艺。可是蔡邕被事情缠住，等他到了邻居家里，酒宴已经开始，大家喝得十分欢畅，这时还有个喜好弹琴的客人在屏风后面弹起了琴，以助酒兴。蔡邕走到门外，听见琴声，就习惯性地停下来听琴。可是，他越听越觉得这琴音中暗藏着极浓的杀意。于是连门都没进，转身回去了。</p>
<p>门口的仆人看到蔡邕刚到就转身回府，赶快跑进去把这件事告诉主人。主人一听，赶紧亲自来到蔡邕家里，问明缘故。蔡邕就把刚才听琴的事情说了。主人觉得很不可思议，就叫来刚才弹琴的客人，问他怎么会在琴声中藏有杀机，那个人说：“哎呀，这可是蔡先生误会了。只是刚才我弹琴的时候，看见一只螳螂正想捕杀一只蝉，那蝉并不知危机四伏，还悠然挥动翅膀，像是要飞走又不飞走的样子。那只螳螂就看着蝉欲飞不飞的状态时进时退。我当时心中很是紧张，唯恐螳螂错失良机捕不到那蝉。这难道也成了杀心，在我弹奏的音乐上表现出来了吗？”蔡邕微微一笑说：“这已经足可以说明问题了。”</p>
<p>固浓不胜淡，俗不如雅也</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>衮冕①行中，著一个山人藜杖②，便增一段高风；渔樵路上，来一个朝士③华衣，便添许多俗气。固知浓不胜淡，俗不如雅也。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①衮冕：古代皇帝及上公的礼这里指代官位。《仪礼•觐礼》：“天子衮冕，负斧依。”</p>
<p>②藜杖：手杖。</p>
<p>③朝士：在朝做官的人。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在衣着华丽的高官显贵之中，如果出现一位手持拐杖身穿粗布衣衫的隐士，自然能增加无限高雅的风韵；在渔夫樵夫中，如果有一位穿着华丽朝服的达官显贵，反而大煞风景增加很多俗气。所以说，荣华富贵并不如清淡宁静，庸俗比不上高雅。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在衣着华丽的高官显贵之中，为什么要增加一段高尚的风雅呢？因为山人是居处在山野乡村的，能够掺杂到朝官贵人当中，必定别具一番超众出群的高风亮节，受朝官贵人尊敬崇仰。</p>
<p>褚伯玉18岁时，新婚那天，新娘子从前门刚进入褚家，他就从后门逃跑了。他一口气逃到剡县，到瀑布山去寻找一位慕名已久的隐士。经过艰苦的跋涉，他终于打听到了那位隐士的去向：隐士云游泰山去了，何时归来，谁也不知。无奈之中，他只好在瀑布山找了一处背风向阳的山坡，自己动手搭了草屋住下来。</p>
<p>褚伯玉如回归大自然的小鸟一般，快乐地生活在大自然中。他在山林间开垦了一片园地，亲手种植了稻米、蔬菜，与山林为友，与松柏、岩石做伴，忍受着风吹雨打、酷暑严寒的考验，在山林里居住了三十年，几乎与尘世完全隔绝。吴郡太守王僧达听说褚伯玉的大名，带着丰厚的礼品，来到瀑布山褚伯玉的住处，苦苦相劝，劝褚伯玉出世。谁知褚伯玉在太守府只住了两宿，便提出要回瀑布山去。他说道：“我是个山林野人，隐居山林已有多年，出来做官非常不适应，更无心侍奉王侯，请太守放我归隐。”交谈中，王僧达得知他不愿娶妻，只把松柏、岩石当朋友，谈及他在山里吃的香草，穿的藤蔓所制的衣服，山林中的烟霞和流泉时，他都兴奋异常，视隐居之地为仙境宝地。深知苦劝无益，王僧达只好让他回山里去了。</p>

<p>荀子说：认识了道，不仅能明察，而且还能实行，这才是真正体会了道。这就是说，对事物的认识和掌握，不能仅仅停留在思想认识上，更重要的在于去实行，并在实行中更深刻地体会事物所隐藏的道理。荀子还讲，行之，明也，也就是说，人的知识和能力只有在实行中才能真正表现出来，也只在实行中才能真正弄懂事物的道理。唐代画家戴嵩，以善画牛著名，与韩干画马并称“韩马戴牛”，即使如此，由于他观察不细致，也不免有疏忽的地方。蜀中有姓杜的隐士，好书画，收藏有许多珍品。他特别喜爱戴嵩一幅《牛》图，锦囊玉轴，随身携带，不时品玩。一天，隐士将收藏品拿出来晾晒，一牧童见到这幅《牛》画，不觉抚掌大笑。隐士问其原因，牧童答道：“此画为斗牛，斗牛时力在角，尾搐入两股之间；而这牛竟翘尾而斗，大错了。”隐士听罢觉得有理，也跟着笑了。</p>
<p>释氏之随缘，吾儒之素位</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>释氏之“随缘①”，吾儒之“素位②”，四字是渡海的浮囊。盖世路茫茫，一念求全，则万绪纷起。惟随遇而安，斯无入而不自得矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①随缘：佛家语，指顺其自然不加勉强。</p>
<p>②素位：指现在所处的地位，做自己应做的事情，不羡慕身外的事情。据《礼记•中庸》：“君子素其位而行，不愿乎其外。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>佛家讲的凡事都顺其自然、不必勉强，儒家讲的要做好自己的分内之事，不要去羡慕自己的身外之事。“随缘”和“素位”这四个字对于人们的作用，就像人们渡海时候使用的浮囊一样重要。因为人生路漫长渺茫，如果凡事都想做得完美，那么会惹起许多烦恼。只有随遇而安，才能处处都体会到怡然自得的乐趣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>佛家说万事随缘，不可以强求。儒家讲要做好自己的分内之事，对于身外之事不必羡慕不已，也不必过于强求，一切顺其自然就好。佛家的“随缘”与儒家的“素位”，其实都是要人们遇到事情不强求，顺应事物自然变化，尽自己的努力把自己能做的事情做好，对于自己能力范围以外的事情听任其自然发展就好。因为生活在人世间，确实有许多事情是人们无法控制的，在这个时候如果求全责备，往往不能如意，只是为自己惹来无穷无尽的烦恼而已。佛家说的“随缘”和儒家讲的“素位”，如果我们照此为人处世，那么确实可以省却许多烦恼，省去许多迷惘。只是这四个字虽然说起来容易理解，也能使人产生深深赞同之感，但是在实际生活中却没有多少人能真正做到。所谓看得破，忍不过就是这个意思。《红楼梦》中有一首《好了歌》曰：“世人都晓神仙好，唯有功名忘不了；古今将相在何方？荒冢一堆草没了。世人都晓神仙好，只有金银忘不了；终朝只恨聚无多，及到多时眼闭了。世人都晓神仙好，唯有娇妻忘不了；君生日日说恩情，君死又随人去了。世人都晓神仙好，只有儿孙忘不了；痴心父母古来多，孝顺儿孙谁见了！”飘然出世，如神仙般自在逍遥虽然好，只是人们却丢不下功名利禄、娇妻幼子。所以佛家说的“随缘”和儒家讲的“素位”，虽然是使人摆脱世俗烦恼的好办法，只不过达到这种境界却不容易，真正能达到这种境界的人也就可以称为达人了。</p>
<p>任幻形凋谢，识本性真如</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>发秃齿疏①，任幻形②之凋谢；鸟吟花笑，识本性之真如③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①疏：稀疏，这里形容人牙齿脱落，所剩不多的样子。</p>
<p>②幻形：佛家语，佛家认为人的躯体是幻形。据《圆沉经》：“幻身灭故幻心亦灭。”</p>
<p>③真如：佛家语，指真理。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>头发脱落、牙齿稀疏，这是人到老年后自然的生理现象。人们大可任其自然不必为此伤心。从小鸟的歌声中与盛开的鲜花中，认识人类本性中的永恒真理。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的生命有限，生老病死是每一个人都不能避开的自然规律。每一个人都要从少年变成老年，茂密的头发会变得稀疏，坚固的牙齿会逐渐脱落，精力会渐渐衰弱。认识到衰老是每一个人必然要经历的自然过程，也就不必为此过于伤心。身体虽然会渐渐老去，不老的精神却会代代相传。每一个人的生命都是有限与无限的结合，单个人的生命是有限的，对于世界的认识也是有限的，整个人类社会却是无限的，人类对于世界的认识也是无限发展的。</p>
<p>创造不朽价值的人，有崇高精神的人，这些人的生命是无限的，因为他们的精神会被人们不断继承发展下去。身体可以老化消逝，宝贵的精神却能长存。</p>
<p>人身体的消亡，使人转化为自然的一部分，与自然真正融为一体。也许会转化为花鸟鱼虫，生命重新开始。世界万物处于不断相互转化之中，消亡的同时新的生命产生，想到这些人们畏惧衰老死亡的心情会缓和许多。知道人生有限，会促使人们更珍惜生命，使生命变得更有价值。知道人的身体会衰老消亡，精神却能长存，可以使我们保持积极心态。一个人的真正衰老，其实不是仅仅指身体的老化，而且也指人的心理衰老。与身体相比，心理上的衰老更为严重。正所谓“哀莫大于心死”，一个人的心变得颓废没有活力，那么这个人的人生也会变得颓废没有活力。古今中外有许多这样的人，他们保持年轻心态，人到老年却创造了辉煌成就。肯德基的创始人山德士上校，在成功建立几百家连锁店的时候，他已经是一位六十多岁的老人。现代社会中，有许多职业是越老越有价值。随着年龄的增长，岁月的累积，使这些人具有丰富的工作经验因而更受欢迎。医生、律师、教师、书画家、作家等许多职业都是如此，经验越丰富越受欢迎。保持健康的生活方式，保持不断学习的精神，保持年轻的心态，在面对衰老时能够更加从容。</p>
<p>养生篇</p>
<p>“养生”这个古老的话题，日久而弥新，在新的时代焕发出新的生命力。养生的观念逐渐渗透进人们的日常饮食及行为活动中，如何养生的话题为人们所津津乐道。其实，对于人生的思考，对于生命的尊重，早在先秦时期，人们就开始提出了自己的见解并展开了讨论。一些思想家也把自己的思索诉诸文字，形成了自己的人生哲学和养生观。</p>
<p>明代朱元璋的第十七子宁王（朱权）说，古代高明的医生善于调整人的心理，预先不使人患病，可是现在的医生只懂得治疗人生理上的疾病，却不知如何调整人的心理，这真是舍本逐末呢。他们不知道疾病是由人的心理不健康引起的，罪恶都是人自己的行为所造。佛家说一切因果都是从心而造，看来确实不错呀。七情六欲从心而生，自己又无法控制，使人的意识颠倒，导致大病缠身，这不是只靠药物能够治疗的。因为药物只能治疗有形之躯所患的生理疾病，却无法调节人在情志上的偏差；能治疗因不良情绪所导致的气血失调，却无法约束“七情”的忽生忽灭，变化无常的状况。所以朱权又说，医生不治执掌刑罚之人的病，药物也无法医治不仁不义之人的疾病。</p>
<p>从这段话，我们可以看到古人对治心为上的重视。《菜根谭》虽没有专门谈及养生之道，然而这本书所讲的又是最高级的养生之道。字里行间的养生之道，是哲学思想和生活领悟的体现。顺应自然，为外物所滞，人的生存不在于形体是否残缺，关键在于精神的完整。就如薪之于火，薪尽而火传之不尽。</p>
<p>爽口味五分，快心事五分</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>爽口①之味，皆烂肠腐骨②之药，五分便无殃③；快心之事，多损身败德之媒，五分便无悔。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①爽口：美味，可口。</p>
<p>②烂肠腐骨：指美味吃得过多会损伤肠胃。</p>
<p>③无殃：没有损害。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>美味佳肴吃多了，就会损伤肠胃，只要控制自己，吃半饱就不会损伤身体；愉悦身心的事情，大多是损害人德行的媒介，所以愉悦身心的事情不可以做过多，适量即可，这样就不会使人将来后悔。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的欲望是无穷无尽的，如果对于自己的欲望不加以控制，而是一味满足自己的欲望，那么不仅不会给自己带来幸福，相反会招来祸患。美味佳肴虽好，吃多了会损伤肠胃；使身心快乐的事情虽好，沉溺于其中，往往会损害德行，严重时甚至使人身败名裂。人不能完全压制自己的欲望，也不能完全放纵自己的欲望，控制在一定范围内，那么就能收到良好效果。既不会使自己因为放纵欲望而招来祸患，也不会使自己因为过分压制欲望而产生异常扭曲心理。根据道德原则来做事情，在一定的条件下，可以尽量使自己欲望得到满足。时时压制自己的欲望不可取，因为欲望如果不能得到及时疏导，而总是压制，那么也许会在某一时刻以一种不可控制的方式发作，从而带来一系列危害。当条件不允许的时候，就需要控制自己的欲望，采用某种方式疏导欲望。</p>

<p>有句成语“过犹不及”，说的就是凡事恰好最妙，如果一件事情做过头了，反而会给自己带来损害。也就是说凡事都需要掌握一定尺度，超过一定的尺度，好事变坏事，美味佳肴变成伤身毒药。世界上万事万物都是如此，把握在一定尺度内，我们能够利用许多事物为我们服务，超过一定尺度这些事物就会给我们带来危害。无论如何美妙的音乐，如果让我们每天从早到晚不停地听，美妙的音乐也会变成噪音。某个选秀活动中，有一位评委老师，她说自己在没有当评委以前很喜欢一首歌。当时参加选秀活动的许多女孩都选这首歌作为参赛曲目，最开始这位评委老师很开心，因为她能听到很多人唱自己喜欢的歌。过了几天之后，她说一听到这首歌就有些烦。再后来，一听到这首歌的旋律响起，她就觉得十分痛苦。万事万物都处于不断变化发展以及相互转化之中，因此我们做事情需要把握一定尺度。</p>
<p>知有生之乐，怀虚生之忧</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>天地有万古①，此身不再得；人生只百年，此日最易过。幸生其间者，不可不知有生之乐，亦不可不怀虚生②之忧。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①万古：永恒不变，形容天地之长久。</p>
<p>②虚生：虚度人生没有成就。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>天与地的运动变化是永恒的，可是人的生命却只有一次；人一辈子活到一百岁已经是高寿，每一天的时间过得都非常快。我们有幸生长在天地之间，不可以不了解生活中的快乐，可是也需要有这样的忧虑，不抓紧时间创造人生价值就会虚度人生毫无成就。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生在世，时间过得非常快，几十年的时间就会使青春少年变成白发老人。有诗曰：“年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同。”花落了春天还会再开，人的生命却只有一次，百年之后不能复生。所以人生在世既需要体会人生的乐趣，更需要有所作为，创造自己的生命价值，这样才不会虚度光阴、浪费生命。</p>
<p>我国汉朝时的大史学家司马迁，从小受到自己父亲的影响喜欢看书。他熟读各种经书，熟悉各种古文。他不仅读万卷书，还行万里路。他年轻时，走遍大江南北，观赏名胜古迹，熟悉各地风土人情，了解各地地理物产。他还搜寻前人的逸闻趣事，以及各种典故。当他当上太史令之后，他更有机会博览群书，看到各种典籍档案。司马迁继承父亲遗志，准备编辑一部出色的史书，为此他做了精心准备。正当他努力编写的时候，发生了一件不幸的事情。李陵是司马迁的朋友，李陵投降匈奴，令汉武帝非常恼怒。朝廷上下，没有人替李陵说话。司马迁只为李陵辩解几句，惹得汉武帝大怒，下令把司马迁抓起来处以宫刑。受到这样刑罚，对于司马迁而言简直是奇耻大辱。但是司马迁忍耐了下来，他在给朋友的信中说：“人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛，用之所趋异也。”他忍受了奇耻大辱，却坚持活了下来，是因为他还有撰写史书的愿望没有完成。现在死去，生命毫无价值。他忍辱苟活，是要效法先人，写出一部伟大的史书，才能够弥补他受到的耻辱。周文王被囚禁在羑里，写就了天下奇书《周易》；孔子被困写出《春秋》，屈原被放逐写下《离骚》，左丘明失明后完成《国语》，孙膑被削掉膝盖骨后编著了《兵法》，吕不韦被贬到蜀地才有《吕氏春秋》，韩非子被囚禁于秦才写出《说难》、《孤愤》。司马迁学习这些先人，在受到宫刑之后，更加奋发图强，写出了光耀史册的宏大史书《史记》，创造了不朽的生命价值。</p>
<p>悉利害之情，绝利害之虑</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>议事者身在事外，宜悉①利害之情；任事②者身居事中，当绝利害之虑③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①悉：了解，明白。</p>
<p>②任事：负责某件事情。</p>
<p>③虑：顾虑。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>评议某件事情的时候，自己没有参与这件事情，应当详细了解这件事情中的利害得失。负责某件事情的人，自己参与到事情当中，应当消除顾虑，把这件事情中的利害得失都放到一边。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有这样一个故事，说的是从前有一个小伙子，有一天到城里去看热闹。他们的国王只有一个女儿，国王非常宠爱这个独生女，发誓要给公主找一个好丈夫。国王是一国之君，什么都拥有，所以对于未来女婿的出身门第等都没有要求。他只有一个条件，如果能满足这个条件，任何年轻健康的小伙子都可以娶公主为妻。看热闹的小伙子就是到城里去看国王招女婿的热闹事。他跟着大家来到一个很大的池子边，发现池子中有许多游来游去的鳄鱼，据说这些鳄鱼都饿了好几天了。国王的条件就是谁能从池子中穿过去，谁就有资格娶公主。国王认为真正肯为公主奋不顾身的人才配得上公主。国王在上面宣布：“年轻人，你们谁有胆量穿过这个鳄鱼池，谁就能成为我的女婿。”公主虽然美丽，成为国王的女婿虽然有很多好处，但是水池中饥饿的鳄鱼实在太可怕，因此大家迟迟不肯行动。就在大家你看我、我看你的时候，突然有一位勇士纵身一跃，跳入水池中。这位勇士身手不凡，奋力往前游，在饥饿的鳄鱼群中，竟然逃脱了性命。当勇士从水池中爬出来的时候，想起了一片欢呼声，大家都为这位青年的勇敢鼓掌。国王也很髙兴，打算将女儿嫁给这位勇士，但是在宣布婚事之前，国王觉得有必要和这位勇士谈几句。他问勇士说：“是什么使得你奋不顾身地跳入水中？”这位勇士也就是来看热闹的那位青年，他哭丧着脸说：“是哪个混蛋把我推下去的？”</p>
<p>没有人敢跳到水池中，是因为大家都害怕饥饿的鳄鱼，权衡利害得失，一边是美丽的公主，另一边却是生命安全。在反复权衡利害得失中，大家都变得犹豫不决，因此没有人敢跳下水池。看热闹的小伙子在没有防备的情况下，被人推入水池中，这个时候已经来不及考虑利害得失。惟有全力以赴、竭尽全力地向前游，集中精神躲开饥饿的鳄鱼，这样才能保住性命。也就是说我们处理事情的时候，如果能够集中精神，全部精神都放在自己要做的事情上，不过多考虑利害得失，这样往往能够收到非常好的效果。</p>
<p>只和气浑然，是居身之宝</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>标①节义者，必以节义受谤②；榜道学者，常因道学③招尤。故君子不近恶事，亦不立善名，只要和气浑然④，才是居身之宝。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①标：标榜，标明。</p>
<p>②谤：毁谤，责备。</p>
<p>③道学：宋儒研究学问主要研究义理，这种学问被称为理学，理学也就是道学。此处道学泛称一切学问道德。</p>
<p>④和气浑然：温和纯朴。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个爱好标榜节义的人，到头来必然因为节义受到批评诋毁；一个标榜道学的人，经常由于道学而招致人们的挟击。因此一个君子平日既不接近坏人做坏事，也不标新立异建立声誉，只是一股纯厚、和蔼的气象，这才是立身处世的无价之宝。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人们讨厌假道学伪君子，因为做人要平实无欺，不可自我标榜吹嘘。真理不是巧言，仁义更非口说。换言之，学问道德并非吹嘘而来，是从艰苦修养中累积而成。有的人好虚名，披上道德外衣，实质上是在骗取人们信任，满足私欲需求，与为非作歹固然有别但却具有更大的欺骗性。一个人居身立世确立正确的原则，不是为了给别人看，而是为磨炼自己的心性，使自己有一个健全的心态，完美的人格。</p>
<p>有学问的人往往被无学问的人耻笑，有道德的人往往被险诈的小人排斥，有道行修养的宗教家往往被欺世的假慈善家诽谤。世间往往是认假而不认真。但是真正达到学问渊博、道行高深的学问家、宗教家们，他们绝不说一句骂人的话，看起来也绝不受他人的注意，这是和气不露头角，居身处世的最好办法。</p>
<p>荀子《荣辱》中说：人的资质秉性，知识和能力，君子与小人一样。爱好荣誉、厌恶耻辱；爱好利欲，厌恶祸害，君子与小人一样。但是求得荣誉和利欲，避免耻辱和祸害，君子与小人所采取的方法就不同了。小人拼命做荒诞不经的事，还想要别人相信自己；拼命干欺诈的事，还想要别人亲近自己；行为如禽兽，还想别人用善意对待自己；心术叵测、行动诡诈，所持的论点难以站住脚，结果必然得不到荣誉与利益，也必然遭受耻辱与祸害。至于君子对别人诚实，也想别人对自己诚实；自己忠厚待人，也想别人用善意对待自己；襟怀坦白，行为安稳，所持的论点易于成立，结果必然得到荣誉和利益，也必然不会遭耻辱和祸害。</p>
<p>忙里要偷闲，闲中要取静</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>忙里要偷闲，须先向闲中讨个把柄①；闹中要取静，须先从静处立个主宰②。不然未有不因境而迁、随事而靡③者。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①把柄：这里用来比喻做事要把握要点。</p>
<p>②主宰：主见。</p>
<p>③随事而靡：随着事物的发展盲目地跟随。靡，散败。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>即使在很繁忙的时候，也要设法抽出一点空闲时间，用以调节紧张的身心，必须在无事时把要做的事先做下调整，养成这种习惯，才会有调剂身心的工夫。要想在喧嚣的环境中保持冷静的头脑，就必须在心情平静时事先对事情做个计划。否则，一旦遇到事情就会手忙脚乱，不知所措，弄得一团糟。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古人有言：闲字要从勤中得来，勤字要从闲中做出。在事务繁忙的时候，要想忙里偷闲，就得先在闲暇的时候找一个机会，也就是说，在平常无事的时候，要把心安置好，有寄托的地方，然后，在忙里才能不乱方寸而有悠闲时间。</p>
<p>古时，孔子周游列国与国君重臣打交道，后来专门教书，也极受尊重，学生们把他比作日月。但孔子自己，并不自以为了不得，他说：“有十户人家的小村镇，就有像我孔丘这样的人，只是他们不像我这样好学罢了。”又说：“有人说我是圣人和仁者，孔丘岂敢当，我不过是一个学而不厌、诲人不倦的教书匠。”正因为这样，他和学生们在一起，也开点玩笑。有一次，刚到了他学生子游做县长的武城，就听到一片弹琴唱诗之声，孔子微微一笑，说：“哈，宰鸡，用得着牛刀吗？”言下之意，似是治理这个小地方，用不着进行礼乐教育。子游当时正接待老师，说：“您以前不是讲过，做官的受了教育，就有了仁爱之心；老百姓受了教育，就比较容易领导吗？”孔子说：“是啊，我刚才只是同你们开开玩笑呢！”孔子爱开玩笑，也是一种奔波中求静的方法，人能在劳顿中保持一点幽默，学会求静，不失君子风范。</p>
<p>雨余观山色，夜静听钟声</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>雨余观山色，景象便觉新妍；夜静听钟声，音响尤为清越①。登高使人心旷，临流使人意远；读书于雨雪之夜，使人神清；舒啸②于丘阜③之巅，使人兴迈④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①清越：声音清脆悠扬。</p>
<p>②舒啸：发出心中闷气。舒，伸展；啸，吹而发声。</p>
<p>③丘阜：小山冈。</p>
<p>④迈：奋发，豪爽。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在雨后观赏山川景色，就会觉得另有一番清新气象；当夜深人静聆听庭院钟声，就会觉得声音特别清脆悠扬。登上高山放眼远看，就会使人感到心胸开阔；面对流水凝思，就会让人意境悠远。在雨雪之夜读书，就会使人感到心旷神怡；爬上小山朗声而啸，就会使人感到意气豪爽。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>智者的恬静并不是由于“静是好的”才学会恬静，而是他的智慧使他明白了世事，世上没有一样东西能骚扰他的心境，因此自然而然地归于平静安宁。水平静了不仅可以照面影，也可以作木匠“定平”的水平仪。俗话说：“心平似镜”，人的心境如果平静了，也能鉴照天地的精微，甚至还可以明察万物的奥妙。这表明对待事物要懂得找出变后面的不变来。</p>
<p>东坡居士游览庐山时与兴龙寺住持常聪和尚言谈甚为投机，夜深了还在烛前论“无情说法”，即山水等无情之物也会说法。黎明之际，苏轼豁然解悟，呈上一诗偈：“溪声便是广长舌，山色岂非清净身？夜来八万四千偈，他日如何举似人？”谷溪之声便是佛尊绝妙的说法，山光水色即是佛的清净真身。今夜无数偈文的真意，今后我怎样才能告诉他人呢？道元也说过：“山色谷响悉皆释尊的声姿。”雪堂寺的行脚和尚看过东坡的诗偈后，认为“便是”、“岂非”、“夜来”、“他日”八字多余，宜删削之。白隐禅师的师父正受老人更有过之：“广长舌、清净身都是多笔，仅溪声、山色就可以了。”白隐有一首著名的歌偈：“坐林中古寺，听拂晓雪声”，其旨意皆与东坡居士同。</p>
<p>渔家傲</p>
<p>而范仲淹在岳阳楼上把酒临风，心旷神怡，发出了“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”的感叹。荀子说，我曾经踮起脚跟向远方眺望，但远不及登上高山见到的广阔无垠；我曾经站在高处伸手招呼，手臂并没有加长，但远处的人却看得清楚；我曾经顺风呼喊，声音并没有加大，但远方的人却听得清晰。孟子也曾说过这样的话：“孔子登东山而小鲁，登泰山而小天下。”这种圣人登山的胸怀，并不是天生的，而是道德修养情操陶冶的结果，德高望重者，胸怀家国，高瞻远瞩，预见未来！什么东西能“使人意远”、“使人神清”、“使人兴迈”呢？唯向自己心内求，向书中求。</p>
<p>昼闲听鸟语，夜静看云舒</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>昼闲人寂，听数声鸟语悠扬，不觉耳根尽彻①；夜静天高，看一片云光舒卷，顿令眼界俱空。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①彻：通达。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>闲暇的白天，人声寂静，听到几声悠扬清脆的鸟鸣声，不禁让人感到耳边格外清净透彻；宁静的夜晚，天空晴朗，看见一片白云在夜色中缓缓飘动，顿时令人觉得眼前特别空灵。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>生活的真相永远是苍白底色的平淡，能够给这平淡生活涂抹色彩，才能拥有多彩、富有情趣的人生。当你觉得自己的生活开始像没有滋味的白开水一样苍白无力的时候，别去寻找更多的理由，那不过是生活还原了它本真的面目，因为自己没有力量去维护它的色彩和味道。首先丰富自己的生命，让自己成为一个多姿多彩的人，那么生动鲜活的生活肯定会围绕在周围，哪怕是在旁人看来再微小无趣的事情，也可以魔术般地赋予它无限的情趣和雅致。就如同：闲暇的白天，人声寂静，听到几声悠扬清脆的鸟鸣声，能让人感到耳边格外清净透彻；宁静的夜晚，天空晴朗，看见一片白云在夜色中缓缓飘动，也能顿时令人觉得眼前特别空灵。</p>
<p>宋代女词人李清照和丈夫赵明诚每每吃过饭，回到房中准备煮茶来喝的时候，赵明诚很喜欢做一种游戏来考考李清照。夫妻俩围着茶炉，坐在他们常年收集来的堆积如山的书卷前，然后互相提问，一个人先提出一个典故，另一个就要回答这个典故出自哪本书哪一卷哪一行。答对了才能喝茶，错了就只能乖乖受罚，为胜利者煮茶。赵明诚总想问倒妻子，可是博闻强识的李清照几乎是常胜将军，每每赵明诚发问，她都可以又快又准地回答出来。可是赵明诚就没那么幸运了，几个回合下来，他常常会被问得张口结舌，只好自认输家。看着丈夫窘迫无奈却又不服的表情，李清照端着丈夫递过的茶开怀大笑，以致将茶水都洒在自己的怀里，没办法喝了。</p>
<p>李清照和丈夫不但爱好相近，更懂得怎样在生活中涂抹自己生活的颜色，所以只不过是饭后的一杯茶，在他们夫妇看来也是可以充满乐趣的小小游戏。</p>
<p>醉倒落花前，天地为衾枕</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>兴来醉倒落花前，天地即为衾①枕；机息②坐忘③磐石上，古今尽属蜉蝣④。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①衾：被子。</p>
<p>②机息：追求名利得失的机心都停止消失。</p>
<p>③坐忘：平心静气，进入物我两忘的境界。</p>
<p>④蜉蝣：一种寿命很短的小虫。古人常用以比喻人生的短促，时间的短暂。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>兴趣到来的时候开怀畅饮醉倒在落花前，天地就是我的被子和枕头；心计停止的时候平心静气地坐在磐石上，古往今来都像蜉蝣的生命那样短暂。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生总难免风浪波折，但是总不能因为前途的曲折坎坷，而就此止步不前，那么面对已经有过的苦难，要以轻松的笑容面对。也正如加莱道雄的话：“有幸得到能领悟自然之最终奥秘的智慧，才赋予生命充分的意义！”</p>
<p>有人说，人生如一叶扁舟，航行在大化的海上，我们要用一生的精力渡到彼岸。的确，我们都为自己预设了一个停靠的码头，叫做理想。为了到达那码头，我们经风雨历霜雪，奋不顾身，死而后已。然而，有多少人能够顺利登上那预设的码头？又有多少人被风浪吞没？</p>
<p>航行的途中难免遭遇风浪，正如生命中无可避免的波折，需要我们从容面对，尽心尽力地应付。闯过了，我们便多了一分胜算，向目标又迈进了一步；失败了，葬身海底不复归，也不枉努力一场，亦无遗憾。预设的码头也许并非我们最终的归宿，出于种种原因，我们也许会停靠在另一个码头。那预设的码头也便成了心中的一道风景，只作为我们奋发向上，搏击风浪的精神支柱。</p>
<p>拂意事休言，会心处独赏</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>花开花谢春不管，拂意①事休对人言；水暖水寒鱼自知，会心处还期独赏。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①拂意：不如意。清张潮《〈快说续记〉小引》：“世有拂意者，于烦恼场中展读一过，不啻如醍醐之灌顶，甘露之洒心。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>花的开放与败落与春天没有关系，遇到不顺心意的事情不要对别人说；水的冷暖鱼儿自然知道，遇到心领神会的地方还望能独自赏玩。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有一只乌龟，因为天旱，找不到水喝而口渴得不能忍受。这时飞来了一只仙鹤，乌龟哀求仙鹤带它到远处的池塘去。仙鹤便用嘴衔着乌龟飞行。飞到一个城市的上空时，乌龟忍不住对仙鹤说：“这是什么地方？为什么不停下来看看呢？”仙鹤想回答乌龟的话，可刚一张嘴乌龟便从空中掉了下去，结果被人拣去宰杀煲了汤。</p>
<p>人的嘴巴有两种功能，一是吃饭，二是说话。世上愚笨的人就像这只乌龟一样，因为口舌不谨慎，常给自己招来灾祸。然而人的话也有两种，一种是该说的，另一种是不该说的。聪明人慎言，谨防祸从口出，言多必失。处理人际关系时要善于倾听，那么有没有人想过，要处理好人际关系最好是自己不要一碰到什么事情就急于倾诉。倾诉固然是对别人的信任，可也是给别人增加负担，占用了别人的时间不说，自己卸下的思想包袱，倒是让听你诉说的人扛起来。假如身处环境还不是那么祥和，“祸从口出”便成为必然。先定下神来自己想一想，品一品滋味，然后再决定该不该说吧。</p>

<p>土床石枕，家风虽然清贫，但睡着时梦里的灵魂也清爽；麦饭豆羹，滋味虽然清淡，但放下筷子时牙齿与腮颊仍留有余香。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>一切波澜过后都是一片平静，再起伏的人生都会归于平淡。平静的日子中难免会期盼波澜壮阔、激荡人心，可是平淡总伴随在人的左右。过惯平淡生活的人想走出平淡，经历风雨的人想归于平淡，人就是一个矛盾的主体，人生就是一个充满矛盾的过程。</p>
<p>有一对恩爱的夫妻，婚后两年，妻子却发现他们的关系已经变得平淡无味，再也没有了昔日的浪漫情调。丈夫是个非常实际的人，而妻子则生性多情。一天，她终于忍受不了这种平淡无味的生活，要求与他离婚。那天夜里，丈夫默默地躺在她的身边，问她，“我怎么能够改变你的想法？”她直视着他的眼睛，慢条斯理地说：“我想要一朵陡峭山崖上的花，可要得到它，你将献出生命，你愿意为我这样做吗？”“我明天给你答复。”他伤心地说。</p>
<p>第二天早上醒来，她发现丈夫不在了，只见饭桌上放着丈夫写的一张字迹潦草的字条，上面写着：“亲爱的：我不会为你采花，让我给你解释为什么。你使用计算机时，总是不时把程序搞乱，每当这时，你就坐在屏幕前哭泣。我不得不动手恢复那些搞乱的程序，并为你擦去眼泪。你总把钥匙忘在家里，我不得不跑回家为你开门。你一累总是痉挛，我不得不为你按摩，缓解你的疼痛。你呆在家里，我总会担心你会得孤独症。为了减轻你的无聊，我不得不不厌其烦地给你说笑话讲故事。当你老了的时候，我会在你身边为你剪指甲，拔白发。有我的陪伴，你永远不会感到孤独。所以，亲爱的，除非我确信有人比我更爱你，我是不会去悬崖为你采花的，那会将你一个人留下……”</p>
<p>她的眼泪落在字条上，弄污了上面的笔迹。</p>
<p>“……这就是我给你的答复。如果你认为我说的有道理，就请把门打开，因为我像每天一样，正拿着你喜欢的面包和新鲜牛奶站在外面。”</p>
<p>她急忙打开门，只见他手里拿着每天的面包和牛奶，期待地站在那里，一副急切的表情。她忘记了她想得到的悬崖之花，充满爱意地一下扑进丈夫的怀里。</p>
<p>看起来平淡的生活，却往往充满着不凡，要善于从生活中发现幸福，要善于从幸福中体味感动，那样，平淡的生活才会成为最享受的生活。平淡的生活才最真。</p>
<p>扫浓淡之见，灭欣厌之情</p>

<p>①纷华：繁华热闹。《史记•礼书》：“出见纷华盛丽而说，入闻夫子之道而乐。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>谈及繁华而讨厌的人，或许真见到繁华时反而会欢喜；说起淡泊而高兴的人，或许真处于淡泊时反而会厌烦。所以人们必须除去对繁华与淡泊的见解，灭掉高兴与厌烦的情绪，这样，才可以忘掉繁华而甘心淡泊。</p>

<p>古时，王莽篡夺西汉王朝的政权后，天水成纪人隗嚣自称上将军，起兵反对王莽。隗嚣感到麾下有才干的官员太少，尤其是真正能担当大任的帅才。为此，他常常忧心忡忡，坐卧不安。军师方望向其举荐韩顺。据说，韩顺注重培养道德品质，青少年时期就以清白节操而享誉乡里。</p>
<p>为了得到人才，隗嚣决定亲自出马。这天，他带上丰厚的礼品，翻山越岭前去拜见韩顺。韩顺见隗嚣到来，连忙以礼相待，献上清茶和水果。隗嚣说明来意后，韩顺对隗嚣说道：“上将军既是我的老乡，又是同窗十载的患难好友，按理我应出山助将军一臂之力。可是如今群雄割据，天下混沌，孰是孰非，难以评说。我劝将军倒不如早日解甲归田，以求清静。对于将军的美意，我只能心领，要我出山，万万不能。还望将军恕罪！”韩顺一番话，说得隗嚣无言以对。他本想劝韩顺出山辅助自己，谁知反倒被韩顺说了一顿，还竭力劝他早日解甲归田。他深知韩顺主意已定，难以更改，也就只好起身告辞了。临别时，隗嚣说道：“人各有志，先生既然不愿出山，我也就不再勉强了。然而所备薄礼，先生务必收下！”韩顺说：“这里山水秀丽，物产丰富，自给自足，心旷神怡。既不需荣华，也不需富贵。您的心意我心领了，但这贵重的东西实在不适合放在我的陋室里，您还是带走吧！”隗嚣推脱不过他，还是带着礼物下山了。一晃儿年过去了。东汉刘秀终将隗嚣打败，隗嚣忧愤而死。隗嚣部下的十三员大将、十万人马全都投降了刘秀。隗嚣所占西北方十六个州郡也被刘秀全部吞并。韩顺始终隐居不仕，过着清贫的生活，直到病逝。</p>
<p>韩顺有官不做跑到深山中隐居，面对自己同乡好友的邀请也不愿意出山，是因为看透了当时的风气，官员大多不能保全自己的名节。做官在任何时候都是一种诱惑，但是当乱世时期，会有很大的风险，对于注重自己名节的人来说，宁愿选择一种平淡的隐居生活也不做官，这是需要很大的勇气的。</p>

<p>富贵死负重，贫贱死释重</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>富贵的一世宠荣，到死时反增了一个“恋”字，如负重担；贫贱的一世清苦，到死时反脱了一个“厌”字，如释重枷①。人诚想念到此，当急回贪恋之首，而猛舒愁苦之眉矣。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①枷：枷锁。《隋书•刑法志》：凡死罪枷而拳，流罪枷而梏。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>富贵的人一生中受尽恩宠荣耀，临死时就会贪恋眼前的荣华富贵，到死时反而增加了一个“恋”字，有如肩负起千斤重担；贫贱的人一辈子受尽清贫困苦，临死时就不用再厌倦生前的贫困生活，到死时反而脱除了一个“厌”字，就像卸下了沉重枷锁。人们如果真能考虑到这些情形，应当赶快回转贪恋的头，急忙舒展愁苦的眉。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>世事维艰，富贵的人也好，贫穷的人也罢，都在千方百计地想要活着，并追求活得更好，这是人强烈的生存欲望在起作用。但是，上至帝王将相，下至平民百姓，惶惶然于生，戚戚然于死，大家其实都是平等的。</p>
<p>人平均每天要睡八个小时，至少在这人生三分之一的时间里，世界上所有的人都是平等的。睡着之后，皇帝和平民，明星和“粉丝”，老板和雇员，上司和下属，胜利者和失败者，几乎是完全平等的，呼噜是一样的响，睡眠是一样的甜，最多是做的梦不一样。面对疾病大家也基本是平等的。谁生病都会痛苦，谁打针都会疼，住在豪华病房里的呻吟声并不比躺在走廊内临时病床上的呻吟更动听。如果不幸患了不治之症，不论是谁，有再好的药，再高明的医生，结局都是一样的。</p>
<p>面对日常一般消费，不会因为谁特别有钱就格外能吃，比别人多长一个胃；也不会因为谁有超大豪宅，就一个人能睡几张床；坐飞机豪华舱固然神气，但并不比坐经济舱早到一分钟；“泰坦尼克号”撞上冰山，不论老板仆人，贵妇丫环，大家一起玩完，海难面前人人平等。据说慈禧太后一餐常要摆上一百个菜，但仅是看看而已，望菜兴叹，远不如《红楼梦》里进大观园的刘姥姥胃口好。</p>
<p>识疏狂足贵，知淡泊为真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>遍阅人情，始识疏狂之足贵；备尝世味，方知淡泊之为真。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>看遍人情世故，才能认识狂放不羁的宝贵；尝尽世间滋味，才能明白恬静寡欲的纯真。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有人能在风云变幻中依然泰然自若，气定神闲，因为他们有自己的心灵空间，始终与贪图享乐的种种诱惑保持距离；而另一些人却总是在与别人的攀比中心神不宁。他们渐渐发觉自己不适应社会生存环境，于是过火的欲望油然而生。在拜金主义、享乐主义心态的驱使下，不少人只有一个目标：为金钱而奋斗，为权势而奋斗。如何让躁动的心变得安静？关键在于开拓当中要有淡泊精神，脚踏实地，顺其自然，从容不迫地迎接每一天太阳的升起，收获属于自己的希望。</p>
<p>南北朝时，建安王刘休仁欲召傅昭为属官，傅昭看到宋朝的政局不稳，一盘散沙，贪官专权，官场你欺我诈，因此屡召而不应。南朝齐永明初年，傅昭长期任南郡王萧昭业的侍读。不久，萧昭业继承帝位，他旧时的属僚臣子纷纷来求个一官半职，唯有傅昭不求荣达，但求清静无为，明哲保身。他的好朋友说他真是个傻子，他笑着说：“世事无常啊！”萧昭业仅当皇帝六个月便被废，许多当时得宠当官的人都遭到了迫害，傅昭因未卷入这场政治争斗而免祸。</p>
<p>在朝代更替的过程中，傅昭混迹于纷乱无序的官场，自身也遭受了许多挫折，却始终保持着自己的地位和名声，关键在于他有自己的立身之道。傅昭的父亲傅淡，在南朝宋时曾任竟陵王刘诞的属官。当时竟陵王刘诞谋反，傅淡也因此受到牵连被杀。父亲被杀时，傅昭年仅六岁，父亲的死使他受到了极大的震动，所以傅昭长大后养成了谨慎、淡泊明志的做人之道。</p>
<p>觉鹏程窄小，知鹤梦悠闲</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>地阔天高，尚觉鹏程之窄小；云深松老，方知鹤梦之悠闲。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>知道了地宽广，天高远，才感到大鹏展翅的距离是多么的狭小；知道云深厚，松柏苍老，才明白仙鹤的梦是多么的悠闲。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的欲望是没有止境的。可是为什么不想一想，即使所有的欲望都得到了满足，有了地位，有了金钱，有了美色，又能享用多少？生活再奢华，也不过一日三餐，日起夜宿。生老病死，谁又可以逃脱自然的法则？自然处世，淡然为人，超然物外，方能泰然自若，坦然无惧。</p>
<p>出身于官宦世家的王僧虔，亲身经历了宋齐间的改朝换代，所以他立身处世十分谨慎，沉稳有度。齐高帝萧道成死后，萧赜继位，即提升王僧虔为侍中、左光禄大夫，这在当时是很高的职位，位同三司。但当时，王僧虔的侄子王俭也在朝中任高官，王僧虔对侄子王俭说：“你在朝中官高任重，我如果再受任，则一门之内有二台司，树大招风，实在可畏。”于是，他便去求见皇帝萧赜，恳切地对萧赜说：“臣近年来体弱多病，平素又碌碌无能，长期以来身居高位，却尸位素餐，实在不可再接受陛下的隆恩了。而且我王家一门二司，长期下去也不是朝廷之福啊，请陛下三思，恩准我告老还乡，从新任命更有才能的人选吧。”面对王僧虔的坚决推辞，萧赜婉言相劝，但始终拗不过他。萧赜也没有其他的办法了，无可奈何只好取消了任命。</p>
<p>朝中有人对此很不理解，便问王僧虔为什么有高官反而辞去不做，王僧虔说道：“君子所担忧的是能不能立德，只有小人才担心会不被宠爱。我现在丰衣足食，高枕无忧，要什么有什么，荣位已经远远超过自己的能力和品德，因此常常为无能报国而惭愧，怎能再受高官，庸碌无为，被人耻笑呢！”那些人听后都有些惭愧，不但没有感到王僧虔无能，反而更加认为王僧虔是一个有德的尊者，更加崇敬他。</p>
<p>观翠红青白，得诗料禅机</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>阶下几点飞翠落红，收拾来无非诗料①；窗前一片浮青映白，悟人处尽是禅机②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①诗料：写诗的素材。</p>
<p>②禅机：悟得佛法的机缘。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>台阶下飘落的几片绿叶，几朵红花，收拾起来无非是作诗的素材；窗前飘过的一片青云，一阵白雾，都是能感悟人心、领会禅理的机缘。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>收拾起暮春深秋来写诗，与一般文人的伤春悲秋不同，春去秋来没有勾起别绪愁怀，而是由此悟出了禅机，或者是一种清闲如仙的感觉。如果对周围的一切都只是抱着欣赏的态度，而不存占有的欲念，那么，心中便只有对美的愉悦，就不会有欲求而不能的忧愁了。</p>
<p>有一名魔术师，能在20分钟内打开无论多么复杂，多么奇特的锁，条件只有两个：不准别人看到开锁的过程。穿特制的衣服开锁。</p>
<p>他在魔术界叱咤了20年，其间有无数人向他发出了挑战，但他从没失过手，他累计开了31868把锁，号称世界开锁大王，很多人专心研究过他，可没有一个人能战胜他。他曾开过一把24公斤的大锁和一把指甲壳大小的锁，这一直是他引以自豪的事。</p>
<p>这天有个老人向他发出了挑战。他把魔术师引到一间房里，房里有一把看似很复杂的锁，它有三个锁眼，内部似乎装有什么特别的机关。开锁前，老人很有礼貌地对他说：“先生，如果你饿了我已准备了可口的饭菜；累了可在床上歇歇……”魔术师瞟了一眼锁，又很自信地看了看老人，从容不迫地走到锁前，老人按规定退了出去。</p>
<p>十分，二十分，时间一分一秒过去了，魔术师在房里忙得大汗淋漓，他使出了浑身的解术，可就是打不开，很显然他已没有信心了。</p>
<p>三天过后，双眼布满血丝的魔术师出来了，他摇了摇头，对那个老人说：“你赢了！不过请你告诉我这把锁怎么开。”老人轻轻一拉，咔嚓，锁开了，原来，那锁根本没锁。啊！魔术师惊呆了。</p>
<p>人，能打开无数把锁，却惟独心灵的锁，难打开！</p>
<p>空拳握古今，握住当放手</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>两个空拳握古今，握住了还当放手；一条竹杖担风月，担到时也要息肩。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>两个空拳掌握古今之事，即使握住了还应当放一放手，不可偏激执念；一条竹杖挑起清风明月，即使挑到了也需要歇一歇，不能迷惑。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人生，宠辱不惊，去留无意，才能地宽天高。在坚持与放手之间，适当地放怀，才能享受闲适，生活的从容。</p>
<p>太多的坚持，产生太多的负累、疲惫，太多的舍不得、放不下，太多的功名利禄、爱恨情仇……蒙住了我们的眼睛染尘了我们的心灵，才错过了许多美景和感动。放弃，放弃一切不必坚持的东西，放弃一切不应有的苦苦挣扎，才能轻装上阵，从容地欣赏路上的万紫千红。</p>
<p>事业上，如果主观愿望和客观结果之间存在着差距，在付出巨大的努力和心血之后，却始终把握不住成功的契机，始终在原地与不远处徘徊，那不妨审视一下自己，看看是否是一厢情愿，过高地估计了自己的能力。如果是，那么放弃自己原有的目标，不再做无谓的坚持，重新调整自己的方向。此时，放弃是一种积极向上的人生态度，远比一条道走到黑更容易成功、更接近人生的真谛。</p>
<p>疑好事皆虚，信闲人是福</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>忽睹天际彩云，常疑好事皆虚事；再观山中古木①，方信闲人是福人。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①山中古木：比喻人生在世，材与不材皆受累，只有悠闲的人才不为物所支使。《庄子•山木》：“庄子行于山中，见大木，枝叶盛茂。伐木者止其旁而不取也。问其故，曰：‘无所可用。’庄子曰：‘此木以不材得终其天年。’”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>忽然看到天边的彩云，转眼间便飘然而去，由此常使人怀疑世上那些美好的事物都是虚幻的事物；再看山中的古树，因没有用处而得以保存下来，由此使人相信世上那些清闲的人才是有福的人。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>自得其乐并不容易，它是寻找生活乐趣的必要条件。做到自得其乐，第一，必须知足，俗话说，“知足者长乐”。第二，善比，要善于发现自己的优势，不能终日这山望着那山高。第三，有点儿幽默感，要能够用微笑迎接厄运，学会自我解嘲，在某种意义上说，阿Q的精神胜利法还是有用的。只有这样才能尽享生活的乐趣，不至于终日陷在没有止境的自寻烦恼中，悲伤自怜，难以见到生命的阳光。</p>
<p>世事勿扼腕，人生且舒眉</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>东海水，曾闻无定波，世事何须扼腕①？北邙山②，未省留闲地③，人生且自舒眉。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①扼腕：手握其腕，表示愤怒或惋惜等情绪。</p>
<p>②北邙山：此山位于河南省洛阳市东北。汉魏以来，历代王公贵族死后多葬于此。</p>
<p>③未省留闲地：坟茔密集，看不到空地。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>东海之中，波澜起伏，从来没有静止不动的波浪，人世的事情也同样有不平，那么对待人世的事情何必常感到愤怒或惋惜呢？北邙山上，坟墓密集，已看不到空闲的地方，由此可知人生都不免一死，那么对待人生应该舒展眉头，乐观超脱。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>蒋琬是三国时蜀国的大臣，处事得体，为人宽厚豁达，很得刘备和诸葛亮的器重。诸葛亮临终前密表后主刘禅：“后事宜以付琬。”诸葛亮死后，蒋琬任尚书令，领益州刺史，升为大将军，不久又加为大司马。</p>
<p>蒋琬执政12年，主要的工作是稳定蜀国内部局势，并积极备战。诸葛亮执政期间，一直奉行休养生息与出兵北伐相结合的战略，量力而行，力尽则止。到蒋琬执政时，不仅是量力而行，同时也是量才而为，蒋琬知道自己的才能和诸葛亮有差距，便不肯冒险出兵。所以说，诸葛亮选蒋琬做继承人，是正确的。</p>
<p>《三国志•蒋琬传》记录了他大度容下的两个小故事，读来耐人寻味。一个是：下属杨戏素来性格简略，蒋琬跟他说话，他经常不应不答。有人在蒋琬面前说：“公与杨戏说话，他都不答。杨戏轻慢上司，不也太过分了吗？”蒋琬说：“人心不同，各如其面。面从后言，古人之所诫也。杨戏要是赞同我，表示肯定的话，那就违反了他的本意；要是反对我的意见，那就显扬了我的缺点。所以默然，这正是杨戏的耿直之处。”另一个故事是：负责督察农务的杨敏曾诋毁蒋琬，说他“做事糊涂，确实赶不上以前的人”。主管官吏请求追究杨敏诋毁上司之罪。蒋琬说：“我实不如前人，没有什么可追究的。”主管官员又请允许他去责问杨敏所指糊涂的具体表现何在，蒋琬说：“苟其不如，则事不当理，事不当理，也就是糊涂了。还有什么可问的呢？”后来杨敏因罪被拘，众人担心他一定会被处死。蒋琬却不以个人亲疏恩怨决断，杨敏终于得免重罪。</p>
<p>大权在握的蒋琬很有自知之明与知人之智，不计个人恩怨，更不以别人对自己的态度来判断是非、定人罪责，而是宽厚待人，雅量容下，诚为可贵。</p>
<p>霜天闻鹤唳，雪夜听鸡鸣</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>霜天闻鹤唳，雪夜听鸡鸣，得乾坤清纯之气①；晴空看鸟飞，活水观鱼戏，识宇宙活泼之机。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①清纯之气：干净纯洁的气息。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在寒霜漫天的天气里听鹤唳，在大雪皑皑的夜间听鸡鸣，便能得到天地清净纯真的气息；在晴朗的天空下观看鸟儿飞翔，在流动的水中观赏鱼儿嬉戏，从而识得宇宙生动活泼的机趣。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>在雪飘霜飞之时，耳闻清唳高亢的鹤鸣，也许能让人想到屈原清醒时的激烈心志；在春风融融的暖日，眼见姿态闲逸的鸥眠，也许能让人想到陶潜醉酣的风流自足。</p>
<p>怀古之外，鹤的风姿很值得推崇，且看，高峻雄昂的老鹤虽然饥渴了，依然还是从容悠闲地饮水啄食，哪肯同家鸡野鸡一样忙忙碌碌地争抢食物？再看，鹤立鸡群之时，鹤的突出状态可说是无可比拟的，但接着与扶摇直上九万里的大海之鹏相比，鹤也就显得渺小了，又进一步与生活在天的极高处（九霄）的凤凰相比，鹤就更难以企及凤凰的巍峨雄伟的体貌了。</p>
<p>显然，类似的比较，能使人产生一种山外有山、天外有天、人外有人的启示。于是，深悟人生与自然的真谛者，只是保持着虚静淡泊的心态；德高望重者待人接物时，则无骄横傲慢的表现。</p>
<p>烹茗听瓶声，炉内识阴阳</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>闲烹山茗听瓶声①，炉内识阴阳之理②；漫③履④楸枰⑤观局戏，手中悟生杀之机。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①瓶声：瓶内水沸声。</p>
<p>②阴阳之理：宇宙间阴阳变化运转的道理。阴，指瓶中之水；阳，指炉内之火。</p>
<p>③漫：漫不经心。</p>
<p>④履：走，移动。</p>
<p>⑤楸枰：以楸木做的棋盘。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>安闲地煮山茶，听瓶中水沸之声，从水与火中认识到宇宙阴阳变化运转的道理；漫不经心地随着棋步的变化观看弈棋游戏，从下棋的手中感悟到世间生存与杀伐的动机。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>庄子曾做过一个梦，梦见自己变成了一只美丽的蝴蝶，他不敢相信地拍一拍自己的翅膀，果然飞起来了，他飘飘然，十分开心，这时候根本就忘了自己是庄周。他在山川林间、在树丛中、在花草上无拘无束地飞翔，欢天喜地，自由自在。他更喜欢自己变成蝴蝶的生活，一会儿站在花蕊上汲汲香喷喷的花蜜，向各色鲜花伸展翅膀微笑。一会儿向下飞，歇在草尖上采露水，露珠晶莹剔透，一颗一颗在草间滚，他就追赶着露珠快乐地嬉戏。累了就扑翅于树林绿叶间，歇歇脚，聆听清风吹拂林间发出的沙沙声。他完全沉醉在成为蝴蝶的梦境中，根本记不得自己姓甚名谁，身在何处。</p>
<p>过了不久，庄子醒过来了，他睁开眼，看到自己还是俗尘凡人，身在这人世间，并没有变做蝴蝶，长出翅膀。他方才醒觉刚才的一切只不过是一场梦。只是梦中的景象太真实，太美好，一切历历在目。在庄周看来，人与蝶没有分别，万物与我合一。也就是说，人生只是一场大梦，在梦中醒，在梦中睡，在梦中悲欢离合……若能观人生如梦，则是非、人我皆如梦中事，若能参破，视死生如梦，物我两忘，则必能物我合一，得到解脱。这正是庄子倡导的一种超脱、自由的精神境界，千百年来感动了无数人。即便在今天，也具有深远的意义。</p>
<p>伴随着社会节奏的加快和物质财富的增加，如何在浮躁的生活中寻找一种安宁，庄子也许可以为我们指一条路。</p>
<p>园圃看蜂忙，觑尘情世态</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>芳菲园林看蜂忙，觑破几般尘情世态；寂寞衡茅①观燕寝，引起一种冷趣幽思。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①衡茅：以横木为门，以茅草盖房，指简陋的房屋。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在花草芬芳的花园，只是观看忙碌采蜜的蜜蜂，也可以从中看破一些人情世态；在寂静冷清的茅屋，只是观看回巢栖息的燕子，也能让人产生一种清雅的情趣和深沉的幽思。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有一次，唐朝著名诗人王维看到一副题为《按乐图》的画，画的是乐队正在台上演奏乐曲。王维便仔细观察了许久，然后很有把握地对别人说：“这画中的乐队正在演奏《霓裳羽衣曲》的第三叠第一拍。”大家都不相信，以为王维瞎说。王维请来了乐工，让他们演奏《霓裳羽衣曲》，然后叫大家仔细观察。果然，当奏到第三叠第一拍时，合奏队员的姿态，手势，表情都和画面完全一样，甚至乐工们的手指，嘴唇在乐器上的位置也都和画中相吻合。大家这才相信王维的判断，称赞王维细致的观察力。画者也正是通过细致的观察，才能使作品人物描绘得维妙维肖。</p>
<p>可见，古人在进行艺术创作时是十分注意细致观察的。只有仔细观察才能准确地反映出千姿百态的自然面貌。同样，仔细观察，也一样能从生活中发现真理。一滴水，我们会发现它同样能折射出太阳的光辉；一粒种子，我们会发现它具有不屈不挠强烈的生命力。一棵花草，一棵幼苗，甚至是小蜜蜂的采蜜、燕子的还巢，都能揭示出人类生活的奥妙。</p>
<p>会心不在远，得趣不在多</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>会心不在远，得趣不在多。盆池拳石①间，便居然有万里山川之势；片言只语内，便宛然见千古圣贤之心，才是高士的眼界，达人的胸襟。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①盆池拳石：如盆之地，如拳之石，比喻空间狭小。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>善于领悟大自然情趣的话，不必跋山涉水去寻求，真正的生活乐趣也并不在多，只要有一个小小的池塘和几块形状各异的石头，就能像置身名山大川一般赏心悦目；片言只语之内，便仿佛见到了古代圣贤的思想精神，这才是高明之士的眼界，旷达之人的胸襟。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>善于领悟大自然情趣的话，不必跋山涉水去寻求，真正的生活乐趣也并不在多，只要有一个小小的池塘和几块形状各异的石头，就能像置身名山大川一般赏心悦目。这有点类似于禅宗的“顿悟”。</p>
<p>云门和尚手持禅杖对众弟子说：“我把这禅杖化成龙，把天地都吞没了。山河大地从何而得呢？”所谓禅杖化成龙，是代指有限归于无限，个体统一于全体。意同“一人发真归于源，十方虚空悉消陨”。杖化为龙，吞并大地，人归真返源时，十方虚空就全部消失了。可是呈现在我们眼前的、巍然不动的山河大地又从何而得呢？有限一旦归于无限，无限的整体反而通过有限的个体展现在面前，一个适当的契机点亮了智慧的明灯。禅宗主张的“悟”，是对人生进行深邃洞察反省，在对自然的思索中寻求心灵的安顿，安静地起居，且和所处的环境同化这是一种内在体验的无媒介的获得，是一种诉诸直观的理解方法。难怪乎禅宗修行，贵在修心。</p>
<p>心与竹俱空，是非不著脚</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心与竹俱空，问是非何处著脚？念同山共静，知忧喜无由上眉。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人心如果像竹子那样空虚而无杂念，请问是非能在何处落脚？思绪如同大山那样沉静安稳，可知忧虑与喜悦便不会在眉梢出现。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>竹远离是非，只要有土，高山密林、土丘高坎皆能随遇而安。难怪传统文人士大夫们爱把竹与松、梅一起并称为“岁寒三友”，以竹来形容君子的正直、谦虚美德。也难怪苏东坡要高吟“可使食无肉，不可使居无竹，无肉令人瘦，无竹令人俗”。</p>
<p>北宋名相吕端为人旷达宽厚，对升迁贬谪之事处之泰然，别人背后议论他的长短或者说他的坏话，他从不计较，也从不因此影响自己的情绪。当属“心与竹俱空，念同山共静”的君子典范。</p>
<p>吕端为人宽厚，喜爱说笑话，是个笑口常开的乐天派。进入朝廷为官以后，任成都府知府，为政清廉，生活简朴，虽然屡经升降，却从未因为这些得失而伤怀。宋太宗时，升为枢密直学士，不久拜参知政事。当时，赵普为中书，对吕端评价很高，说：“我看吕公奏事，受到嘉奖没有大喜过望，遇到挫折也没有丝毫畏惧，喜怒不形于色，真是台辅之器啊！”他从不与官位相当的人争名次，甘居他人之下。左谏议大夫寇准拜为参知政事，吕端奏请居于寇准之下，太宗却以吕端为右谏议大夫，位在寇准之上。后来，吕端代替吕蒙正为相，老成持重，识大体，以清简为务。因为他与寇准同列，却先居相位，唯恐寇准内心不平衡，就奏请皇上准许参知政事寇准与宰相分日值班，其谦让如此！太宗训喻：“自现在开始，中书事必须经过吕端详酌，然后再奏给朕。”从此后，吕端更加谦让。</p>
<p>一般人中多有笑口常开的乐天派，一旦掌权，便会变得整日忧心于外，谨慎小心，吕端身为宰相竟然能够保持“谦虚、喜怒不形于色”的本色，喜爱说笑，不计较一时得失，不虑风波之言，对升迁贬谪之事处之泰然，其修为着实令人佩服。</p>
<p>养志于清修，栖心于淡泊</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>趋炎虽暖，暖后更觉寒威；食蔗能甘，甘余便生苦趣。何似养志于清修，而炎凉不涉；栖心于淡泊，而甘苦俱忘。其自得为更多也。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>依附炎热虽能得到温暖，但得到温暖后更会感到寒冷的严厉；咬甘蔗虽能尝到甜味，但尝到甜味后便会产生苦涩的趣味。人们还不如在清静安闲中修养心志，而与炎热和寒冷都不相干，在恬静寡欲中安定心性，而将甘甜和苦涩皆忘掉。如能这样，人们自己从中得到的乐趣就更多了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>古今有许多关于心理学的论著，其中有一本名曰《心经》，《心经》中有这样一句话：“心中不可有挂碍，有挂碍者，患得患失，乃至心生恐惧，丧失心智，惶惶不可终日。”挂碍，是一种牵挂和障碍，这种诱惑和痴迷也许是名，是利，是财，是权，是色，是情。</p>
<p>追求名利、权势、情爱是很正常的事情，获得名利和钱财可以改善人的生活，可以使自己实现理想和价值，获得尊重和荣誉；得到情爱可以使人快乐幸福，这些追求都会给人们带来益处。而万事皆有度，“过犹不及”，过度地追求就变成了痴迷。痴迷于名利的人，争名夺利，不择手段；痴迷于权势的人，尔虞我诈，明争暗斗；痴迷于情色的人，深溺其中，不可自拔。为了这些挂碍而深陷其中的人，都会痴迷地追逐，如果没有得到，就不择手段地获取，得到了，还要更多，贪婪地永远无法满足。</p>
<p>随之，这些追求也就变成了心魔，变成了挂碍，这些挂碍有一种致命的诱惑，乃至于使人迷失了本性，丧失了理智，为心魔所奴役和驱使，使人痴迷地追逐“挂碍”而漠视和忽略了其它，贪婪地放纵和占有，最后的恶果却是在算计得失时，算来算去算到自己。</p>

<p>拥飞花落絮，坐锦绣团裀</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>席拥飞花落絮，坐林中锦绣团裀①；炉烹白雪清冰，熬天上玲珑液髓②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①团裀：圆形的坐褥。</p>
<p>②玲珑液髓：清澈的玉液。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>席上拥有纷飞飘落的花絮，坐在林中锦绣的圆褥上，能使人物我两忘；炉上煮着洁白的冰雪，锅里熬着天上晶莹清澈的玉液，能使人心性清静。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>东汉末年，杰出的医学家张仲景认为“养神畅志、立志修德”是精神养生之根本。他的一生清心寡欲，排除杂念，思想清静，节制私欲，并注意消除嫉妒心理。他不因当了大官，手中有权，就为个人为亲朋牟取私利；不因有势而高高在上，周旋于官场；更不因有钱而挥霍享受或沉醉于酒色之中。他两袖清风，不计较个人得失，把权、钱看得淡如清水，从不为身外之物而烦恼，从而使自己精神舒畅豁达，专心致志地攻读医书，行救死扶伤、治病救人之德行。他还经常利用空余时间为广大百姓治病，随叫随到。对就诊者不分亲疏，不分富贵贫贱，一视同仁，一概不收报酬。对无钱买药的贫苦患者，解囊相助。</p>
<p>那时，张仲景虽然当官，但并不热衷于官位。不久，他见朝政日非，叹息地对人说：“君主的疾病可以治愈，国家的病患难以根除啊！”于是辞官归去，来到了少室山，专门总结经验，致力于医学著作。</p>
<p>古人认为多做好事，本身就是幸福。这叫“外功内果”，即利人利物之善举，会给自己带来愉快，给生活带来无穷的乐趣，给自己所追求的事业提供充沛的精力和健壮的身躯。张仲景一生致力于医学事业，不为官卖命，而为民行善，他的一生过得充实，活得成功。</p>
<p>许多人总是把物质的多少、外表形象的好坏看得过于重要，用金钱、精力和时间换取所谓的优越生活，只图回报，不愿付出，渐渐地，他们会发现自己的内心在一天天枯萎。事实上，只有找到真实的自我，才能精神饱满，容光焕发。</p>
<p>想屈原激烈，会陶潜风流</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>鹤唳雪月霜天，想见屈大夫醒时之激烈；鸥眠春风暖日，会知陶处士醉里之风流。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在大雪纷飞、浓霜铺地的天气里听到仙鹤悲鸣，便会想到当年屈原在众人皆醉他独醒时的慷慨激烈；在春风荡漾、阳光普照的日子里见到海鸥安眠，便会领悟到当年陶渊明辞官归隐后沉醉时的风流超脱。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的精神世界是极其神秘的，且深不可测，历史上的文人们离我们已经很遥远，其情其境早已灰飞烟灭，那精神世界的博大精深我们不能妄自忖度。众多事例足以证明，个人的精神世界的豪气可以冲击浩大的宇宙和整个人类世界固有的且固守着的文明。</p>
<p>陶渊明，东晋这个不愿意在樊笼里的诗人，他归田园隐居，原因仅仅是性本爱丘山，当然也是猛志溢四海的壮志没有能够得以伸张，理想不能实现的逃避。但是他能够告别历史文人的进亦忧退亦忧的入世思想，真正地舍弃了居庙堂之高和退江湖之远的一切烦恼，把自己真正地放到自然里，以纯真的生活方式，追求幸福平等没有等级门第观念的生活，寄情于天地之逆旅。</p>
<p>而更早时期的屈原，拥有商鞅般的创新意识，可惜，每朝有每朝的腐朽，每代有每代的阻碍，那些挡在楚国兴盛途上的奸险小人也是在自我摧毁。悲哀的屈原把他的爱、恨全献给了《楚辞》的创作。他把现实的叙述和幻想交织起来，抒发自己强烈的爱国爱民激情和崇高纯洁的品质。长诗中屈原陈述自己的美政理想，及为实现这些理想所受到的种种阻碍与打击。在艰险的处境中，他依然对国家和人民遭受的苦难表示深切的忧愤与同情。“长太息以掩涕兮，哀民生之多艰。”为解救国家的危难和人民的疾苦，他表示：“亦余心之所善兮，虽九死其犹未悔。”在诗篇中，屈原者还幻想渡过沅水和湘水，到九嶷山去向古帝舜陈诉，以求得启示；离开舜帝后，诗人又驾起玉龙，坐上彩凤，乘着清风，向上天进发，当抵达一座神山时已是黄昏了，他不禁又感叹：“路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。”就在这富有浪漫主义色彩的意境中，凸现出了屈原对理想的执着和追求。就是最后的自投汨罗，也以一种难以形容的悲壮唤醒了一批人，又震撼了另一批人，即使是秦国也会为屈原的人格而屈服，那是超脱世俗的人格。那些排挤他、嫉妒他的人定会在内心觉得不安，楚王定会为失此良臣而懊悔。</p>
<p>黄鸟呼醉客，白云媚幽人</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>黄鸟情多，常向梦中呼醉客；白云意懒，偏来僻处媚幽人①。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①幽人：隐士。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>黄鸟情多，常在树上啼叫，唤醒梦中的醉客；白云意懒，随风飘浮，偏要到边远的地方来讨好幽居的隐士。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>段干木，是孔子弟子子夏的得意门生。求学期间，段干木对六国之间的不义之战深感厌恶。学业结束后，他弃官从商，并对老师子夏说：“用仁政德治是不切合实际的。现在天下无道，孔子的政见没有哪个君王肯接受，更不可能去实现。天下有道，孔子的政见自然就会实现了。”子夏见无法劝住段干木，也只好由他去了。</p>
<p>魏文侯早已闻知段干木的才名，求贤若渴的心情很迫切。一天，风和日丽，晴空万里，魏文侯很有兴致，决定亲自去拜访段干木，请他出来辅佐自己治理天下。当魏文侯一行来到段干木家时，侍从向段干木的家人说明了来意，请家人告知段干木，希望他同魏文侯一见。</p>
<p>段干木得知魏文侯来访，对他的礼贤下士，内心确实十分感激。但他看破了红尘，淡泊了名利，无意仕途，便叫家人转告魏文侯：“段干木已到外地购货去了，不在商铺。请大王不必久等。”</p>
<p>魏文侯没有见到段干木，只好扫兴而去。但是，段干木在魏文侯心目中的形象更加高大了，魏文侯更加敬重他了。</p>
<p>面对世俗的争端，要保持一颗平静的心是难能可贵的。特别是在某些方面做出成绩的时候，很多的诱惑都会随之而来，如何坚持自己的德行和操守、拒绝诱惑便是困难之处。段干木知道自己的理想是仁政，但是当时的环境不可能实现那样的理想，即便成为魏文侯的重臣，也无力改变“春秋无义战”的现实。所以，为了保持自己的德行和操守，段干木才会选择远离仕途的诱惑。</p>
<p>栖蓬神情旷，结翁意念真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>栖迟①蓬户，耳目虽拘，而神情自旷；结纳山翁，仪文②虽略，而意念常真。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①栖迟：隐居。</p>
<p>②仪文：礼节。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>隐居简陋的茅屋，耳目虽然受到局限，但神情自然开朗；结交山居的老翁，礼节虽然粗疏，但意念常常纯真。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>游戏于大千世界，漫步于人生禅机，追物而不为物所困，寻爱而不被爱所累，欲路勿染，俭以养德，这实在是人生的一大梦境。</p>
<p>一位富翁待人非常大方，乐善好施，人们都以为他的生活很奢华。有一天他带着佣人出去散步，看到地上有一根线，他弯腰拾起，告诉佣人说：“这根线好好的，还可以用。”然后放进口袋中。世人常以为待人刻薄才是节俭之道，其实不然，待人刻薄，只是吝啬。</p>
<p>隐居简陋的茅屋，耳目虽然受到局限，但神情自然开朗；结交山居的老翁，礼节虽然粗疏，但意念常常纯真。现代社会对现代人要求绝不能没有欲望。你可以去追求欢乐，你可以在适当的时候做些、说些昧着良心的事和话，但做人要有一个根，这个根就是原则。所谓的原则就是在做了违背某些道义的事后，灵魂要有一个着眼点。否则，得到之后是空虚，将永远背上包袱前行。所以说，人最重要的是一个根，在长辈面前是关怀的根，在朋友面前是友谊的根，在家人面前是信任的根。有了这些根，无论你在外面怎么折腾，多么风光，都能找到人与之真心分享。</p>
<p>曰尘世苦海，彼心自尘苦</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>世人为荣利①纷缠，动曰尘世苦海。不知云白山青，川行石立②，花迎鸟笑，渔唱樵歌，世亦不尘，海亦不苦，彼自尘苦③其心尔。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①荣利：荣华名利。</p>
<p>②川行石立：川水之流，溪石耸立。</p>
<p>③尘苦：尘世间的诸般烦恼。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>世间上的人都被虚荣心和利禄心所缠缚，因此动不动就说这个世界是个苦海。从来不知道这个世界有白云笼罩下的青山翠谷，屹立在奔流河水中的奇岩怪石、迎风招展的美丽花卉、呢喃歌唱的小鸟，以及樵夫一边砍柴一边唱歌时山鸣谷应之声。其实，这世界一点儿都不尘俗嚣扰，而苦也不如海般深广，只是人们使自己的心落入尘嚣堕入苦海罢了。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子说：“君子的心胸平坦宽阔，小人却经常局促忧愁。”子路问孔子：“君子也有忧愁吗？”孔子回答：“君子没有得到职位的时候，在修养心志中感到快乐；得到职位后，在办好政事中得到快乐。因此君子终身快乐，没有一天忧愁。相反，小人在没有得到职位的时候，就忧虑自己得不到；得到职位后，又生怕失去它，因此小人终身忧愁，没有一天快乐。”</p>
<p>难怪孔夫子会说：“君子坦荡荡，小人长戚戚。”但是山川依旧，景色依然。假如人不为物欲情欲所困扰，能看开名利，又怎能不见山川，不见美景呢？世间本来就没什么苦乐可言，一切皆由人心不足所产生。好名之人必为虚名所苦，重利之人必为贪利所困。好名重利是人性的一部分，也是人性中最脆弱的一环，世人不要太积极于名利，以免作茧自缚。所谓的苦海固然有物累，但人心不足贪图不止是堕入苦海的主要原因。生活的苦、条件之艰可以通过多方的努力来解决，但内心的苦，行动之艰却需要自己努力跳出物欲：少求名利才可以解脱。</p>
<p>高形逸神劳，下形劳神逸</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>贪得者身富而心贫，知足者身贫而心富；居高者形逸而神劳，处下者形劳而神逸。孰得孰失，孰幻孰真，达人当自辨之。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>贪求财物的人身体虽然富足，但内心空虚，自知满足的人身体虽然贫困，但内心充实；身居高位的人身体虽然安逸，但心神劳碌，处于微贱的人身体虽然劳碌，但心神安逸。谁得谁失？谁虚幻谁真实？通达事理的人自己应当辨别得出。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>辩证唯物主义告诉我们，物质决定精神、经济基础决定上层建筑，同时也告诉我们精神对物质、上层建筑对经济基础的反作用。其实物质的极大丰富与人们觉悟的极大提高是相辅相成的，人民的物质生活富裕，其精神生活才会更有质量。如果一个人的衣食短缺，他的精神生活一定更加单调。正如一个吃不上饭的人，是一定不会上网消遣的。因此人们首先关注的是自己的衣食住行，其次才是自己的精神文化生活，这是很简单的道理。</p>
<p>但是我们要知道对物质的追求是没有止境的，如果一个人的一生只关注对金钱的索取，那是一辈子也无法满足的。所以需要人们端正对物质和精神的关系，在实现温饱的基础上，不断充实自己的精神生活，使自己的一生更有意义。因为真正的幸福不在于物质享受，而是精神愉快。常言道，在龙床上夜不能寐的人一定没有在木板床上酣然入睡的人幸福。</p>

<p>奢者富不足，俭者贫有余</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>奢者富而不足，何如俭者贫而有余？能者劳而伏怨，何如拙者逸而全真？</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>奢侈的人虽然富有，但心里总是不满足，还不如节俭的人虽贫穷，但心里充实；有能力的人虽然劳累，但结下了怨仇，还不如愚笨的人安逸，能保全真心。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人活着必须清楚自己要的是什么。其实我们需要的很简单，我们要的只是幸福。</p>
<p>幸福是什么，它没有具体的概念，也许是一种感觉，也许是精神，也许是物质，而这两者都不可少，尤其在现在这个社会。但是，精神上的富有，显得更重要。精神的力量是无穷的，意念是神奇的，只有精神富有，才会有更高层次的追求。人要有物质追求，生活的质量才有保障，但不可以为物质所迷惑，物质的背后是对理想的执著。只有实现自己的理想，完成自己的使命，这一生才是有意义的。</p>
<p>做一个有修养有品位的人，活得洒脱点，人生时刻面临困境和挑战，敢于面对生活的波浪的人才是真正的强者。时刻准备着，为美好的生活而努力，为我们深爱的和深爱我们的人好好活着。不管是富有，还是贫穷，不管是知识丰富，还是身无长物，都要做个快乐的人，充实地活着。</p>
<p>无名位乐真，无饥寒忧甚</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>人知名位①为乐，不知无名无位之乐为最真；知饥寒为忧，不知不饥不寒之忧为更甚。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①名位：名利和地位。《史记•西门豹传》：“西门豹为邺令，名闻天下。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>只知道拥有名利地位是人生一大乐事，人们却不知道那种没有名声地位牵累的快乐才是最实在的人生乐趣；只知道挨饿受冻是最痛苦、最值得忧虑的事，人们却不知道那些虽无饥寒之苦，却因为种种欲望，弄得精神空虚忧愁才更加痛苦。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人的需求是有层次的，当生活温饱解决之后，精神上就产生了不同的层次需求。安贫乐道，消极等待是不对的，因为人们追求财富显贵而使生活过得更好些是很现实的，但并不能因此而忘却自身修养。</p>
<p>勿争长竞短，勿较雌论雄</p>

<p>石火光中①争长竞短，几何光阴？蜗牛角上②较雌论雄，许大③世界？</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①石火光中：用铁击石所发出的火光一闪即逝，形容人生短暂。</p>
<p>②蜗牛角上：比喻地方极小。</p>
<p>③许大：多大。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>人生就像用铁击石所发出的火光一闪即逝，在这种短暂的生命时光中去争夺名利究竟有多少的时间呢？人类在宇宙中所占的空间就像蜗牛角那么小，在这狭小的地方去争强斗胜究竟有多大世界呢？</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>清代才女王贞仪出生在一个书香门第，祖父做过官，官虽不大，家里藏书却放满了75个书柜，她自幼就喜欢在祖父的书房里博览群书。王贞仪年纪很小时就已懂得珍惜时间，她说：“人生学何穷，当知寸阴宝。”认为人生有学不尽的知识，要珍惜一分一秒的时间。</p>
<p>可是，在当时的封建社会里，不要说研究科学，妇女连写诗作文都有人讥讽，那些所谓士大夫们认为妇女只能侍弄酒食、缝纫衣服，不应握笔舞文弄墨。王贞仪对这种男尊女卑的封建习俗愤愤不平。其在写给女友方夫人的信里说：“男女同是人也。”她写的诗中有这样的句子：“始信须眉等巾帼，谁言女儿不英雄！”由此可见她多么想挣脱男女不平等的羁绊，冲向云霄去自由地飞翔。王贞仪虽感到现实生活对她的压抑，但她并不自暴自弃。她主张妇女应加强学习，注意自身修养，“岂知均是人，务学同一理”。</p>
<p>王贞仪自己就是这样身体力行的。她常独自一人抬头看天，研究气象，观察云彩的流动变幻，注意气候的干湿潮润，经过长期观测记录，积累了大量的资料。对于天气的变化，她已大体能掌握，可以做到预测阴晴风雨。对所在地区的天时和农作物的丰收或旱涝，她都能作出正确判断。在短暂的一生中，她写下了大量的论文、著作，现存的有《德风亭初集》十三卷。除文学作品外，她还著有《星象图解》、《历算简存》、《地圆论》等十几样天文数算书和单篇文章。</p>
<p>“足行万里书万卷，尝拟雄心胜丈夫”，生活在200多年前的王贞仪少女时代就树立了这样的雄心壮志。当时，她既无老师传授，又无同学可共同探讨学问，甚至连极简单的科学仪器都没有，就靠自己勤奋学习、刻苦自学、反复实践，取得了天文、数学、气象等学术方面的成就。这在当时是绝无仅有的。清代学者钱仪吉称赞她为自班昭之后，唯一的女中杰出人才。</p>
<p>常忧死虑病，可消幻长道</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>色欲火炽，而一念及病时，便兴似寒灰；名利饴甘，而一想到死地，便味如嚼蜡。故人常忧死虑病，亦可消幻业①而长道心②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①幻业：为佛家术语，是梵语“羯魔”的意译，本指造作的意思。</p>
<p>②道心：发于义理之心。《朱子全书•尚书》篇：“人心，人欲也；道心，天理也。所谓人心者是血气和合做成；道心者是本来禀受仁义礼智之心。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>色欲像烈火一样燃烧起来时，只要想一想生病的痛苦，烈火就会变得像一堆冷灰；功名利禄像蜂蜜一般甘美时，只要想一想死时的情景，名位财富就会像嚼蜡一般无味。所以一个人要经常思虑疾病和死亡，这样也可以消除些罪恶而增长一些进德修业之心。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>人在病中，会感到人生虚幻与可悲，到了快要死亡的时候大概又只剩求生的念想了。所以人平时做事应朝事物的对立面想想，而不是随心所欲，任意胡为。孔子说：“君子有三戒：少之时，血气未定，戒之在色；及其壮也，血气方刚，戒之在斗；及其老也，血气既衰，戒之在得。”戒色可保寿，戒斗可免祸，戒得可全名。朱子说：“圣人同于人者血气也，异于人者志气也。君子养其志气，故不为血气所动，是以年弥高而德弥助也。”人生在世，宜控制自己的欲望而修些德性，做事勿为欲望迷失本性，如此终会有所作为的。</p>
<p>有一位学者飞于世界各地，忙着演讲。曾经有一次差点遇到空难，丢掉生命。至今，他还保留着那张过期的机票。后来，每当他遇到不顺心的事或遭遇挫折时，他总会将那张泛黄的过期机票再拿出来看一次。这时，他心中所有的不平与怨气，都会瞬间消失得无影无踪，因为经过那次死亡之约后，他觉得每一天都格外珍贵。生命很脆弱，有太多的偶然可以终止生命的旅程。</p>
<p>贪得者乞丐，知足者王公</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>贪得者，分金恨不得玉，封侯怨不授公，权豪自甘乞丐；知足者，藜羹①旨于膏粱②，布袍暖于狐貉③，编民④不让王公。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①藜羹：藜菜做的羹汤，比喻粗劣的食物。</p>
<p>②膏粱：肥肉谷米，比喻精美的食物。</p>
<p>③狐貉：狐貉皮做的大衣。</p>
<p>④编民：编入户籍的平民。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>贪欲深重的人，分给他金银，还会怨恨没有分到珠玉；已封为王侯，还会埋怨没有授予他公爵，所以显贵权豪身居高位，但因不知足而心甘情愿地做乞丐。自知满足的人，吃野菜粗粮，会觉得比肥肉谷米味更美；穿粗布袍褂也觉得比狐貉皮大衣更暖和，虽然是平民百姓处于低层，但因知足，品格并不比王公贵族卑贱。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>有人疑惑：现代社会是否应该提倡知足常乐。这似乎是一个常辩不衰的话题。</p>
<p>《老子》曾经说过：“祸莫大于不知足，咎莫大于欲得。”在现代社会，人们的欲望无限膨胀，似乎任何东西，都可以成为占有的对象；在现代社会，对“进步”理解过于片面，似乎任何现状，都需要无限制地破坏；在现代社会，对发展的追求过于盲目，似乎任何资源，都可以肆意挥霍。这种所谓“永不知足”的心态，是造成种种现代病的根源。在种种现代病的困扰下，现代人处于“常不乐”和“乐不常”的状态。西方后现代思潮的兴起，就是基于对现代病的深刻反思。</p>
<p>也有人会说：如果满足于煤油灯，人类就不可能有电灯；如果满足于平房，人类就不可能住上楼房。</p>
<p>现代社会，科技发展日新月异，物质产品极大丰富。有多少人在嘲笑古人生产力的落后，有多少人在惋惜古人物质生活的简陋。然而，我们现代人面对的现实却是，心理压力日益沉重，自然环境日益恶化，人际关系日益淡漠，社会发展急剧变化。想一想，如果没有体会到煤油灯带来的乐趣，人们怎么可能再去发明电灯？没有享受过住平房的乐趣，怎么有动力去建造楼房？真正知足常乐的人不是穷快乐，而是住平房时享受平房的乐趣，住楼房时享受住楼房的乐趣，不会因为从平房搬进了楼房就觉得高人一等，也不会因为从楼房搬进了平房就觉得难以接受。知足常乐不是用楼房来衡量的，也不是用平房来衡量的，而是指向每一个已经实现的目标或愿望。</p>

<p>杯中吟风月，躲万丈红尘</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>芦花被①下卧雪眠云②，保全得一窝夜气；竹叶杯③中吟风弄月④，躲离了万丈红尘⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①芦花被：以芦苇花作棉絮的被子。</p>
<p>②卧雪眠云：睡在山野之中。</p>
<p>③竹叶杯：酒杯。竹叶，此指竹叶青，酒名。</p>
<p>④吟风弄月：面对清风明月，吟咏诗歌。</p>
<p>⑤红尘：飞扬的尘土，即指人世。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>身盖芦花被褥，居住在清静的山野中，便能保全一窝清新的晚风；手持竹叶酒杯，沉浸在吟咏风光邀对明月的意境里，就能摆脱人世的种种烦恼。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>手持酒杯，赏风月吟诗歌，平日在红尘中翻腾的人们，可以暂时远离世俗的种种烦恼。平日汲汲于追求名利的小人，只知追求衣食住行的豪奢丰足，心便自然而然的世俗化。反之，人处于清寒淡泊的境界，反倒会有无穷的趣味。</p>
<p>元朝时，贯云石南游途经梁山泊，喜爱上一床用芦花絮成的被子。被子的主人渔翁要求贯云石用诗来交换。贯云石略加思索，吟出了一首七律：“采得芦花不涴尘，绿蓑聊复藉为茵。西风刮梦秋无际，夜月生香雪满身。毛骨已随天地老，声名不让古今贫。青绫莫为鸳鸯妒，欸乃声中别有春。”这首《芦花被》诗广为流传，贯云石用它换取芦花被的事也传为佳话。后来，贯云石干脆又取了“芦花道人”的别号，并写道：“清风荷叶杯，明月芦花被，乾坤静中心似水。”宣布了自己和名利场的决绝，开始了他十年浪迹江湖、专心创作的新生活。</p>
<p>闲看花开落，漫随云卷舒</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>宠辱不惊①，闲看庭前花开花落；去留②无意，漫随天外云卷云舒。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①宠辱不惊：对于荣耀与屈辱无动于衷。</p>
<p>②去留：去是退隐，留是居官。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>对于一切荣耀与屈辱无动于衷，用安静的心情欣赏庭院中的花开花落；对于官职的升迁得失丝毫不放在心上，冷眼观看天上浮云随风聚散。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>宠，是得意的总表相。辱，是失意的总代号。得到了荣誉、宠禄不必狂喜狂欢，失去了也不必耿耿于怀。忧愁哀伤、得失界限不会永远不变，一切功名利禄都不过是过眼烟云，得而失之，失而复得这种情况都是经常发生的。意识到一切都可能因时空转换而发生变化，就能够把功名利禄看淡看轻，做到“荣辱毁誉不上心”。</p>
<p>有一次，孟子准备去见齐王，恰好这时齐王派人捎话，说是自己感冒了不能吹风，因此请孟子到王宫里去见他。孟子觉得这是对他的一种轻慢，于是便对来人说：“不幸得很，我也病了，不能去见他。”第二天，孟子要到东郭大夫家去吊丧，他的学生公孙丑说：“先生昨天托病不去见齐王，今天却去吊丧，齐王知道了怕是不好吧？”孟子说：“昨天是昨天，今天是今天，今天病好了，我为什么不能办我想办的事呢？”孟子刚走，齐王便打发人来问病。孟子的弟弟孟仲子应付说：“昨天王有命令让他上朝，他有病没去，今天刚好一点，就上朝去了，但不晓得他到了没有。”齐王的人一走，孟仲子便派人在孟子归家的路上拦截他，让他不要回家，快去见齐王。孟子仍然不去，而是到朋友景丑家避了一夜。景丑问孟子：“齐王要你去见他，你不去见，这是不是对他太不恭敬了呢？这也不合礼法啊。”孟子说：“哎，你这是什么话？齐国上下没有一个人拿仁义向王进言，这才是不恭敬哩。我呢，不是尧舜之道不敢向他进言，这难道还不够恭敬？曾子说过，‘晋国和楚国的财富我赶不上，但他有他的财富，我有我的仁，他有他的爵位，我有我的义，我为什么要觉得比他低而非要去趋奉不可呢？’爵位、年龄、道德是天下公认为宝贵的三件东西，齐王哪能凭他的爵位轻视我的年龄和道德呢？如果他真是这样，便不足以同他有所作为，我为什么一定要委曲自己去见他呢？”</p>
<p>羡山林之乐，未必得林趣</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>羡山林①之乐者，未必真得山林之趣②；厌名利之淡者，未必尽忘名利之情。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①山林：隐士所居住的地方。</p>
<p>②趣：趣味。李白《月下独酌》：“但得醉中趣。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>经常畅谈山野林泉生活之乐的人，未必就能完全领悟山林的真正乐趣；经常高谈讨厌功名利禄的人，心中未必就完全忘记名利思想。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>后汉阳羡人许武，被推举为孝廉后，官运一帆风顺；但他的两个弟弟许晏和许普，却仍默默无闻。许武为了让两个弟弟早日成名，有一天，就对两个弟弟说：“礼也有分异之义，因此我想和你们分家，你们看如何？”两个弟弟表示无异议，许武于是将家产分成三份，把肥田、大宅、壮仆都分在自己名下，而将薄劣的田地房屋、体弱多病的奴仆分给弟弟，两个弟弟都没有说什么。</p>
<p>正因如此，当时乡里父老都称赞两个弟弟对兄长的礼让，而轻视许武的贪婪。不久，许晏和许普果然盛名远播，并被乡人推举为孝廉，分派官职。一段日子后，许武召集宗亲族人，说：“我曾侥幸被推举为孝廉任官，但我的两个弟弟却都无法踏入仕途。为了让弟弟们能有机会被选为孝廉，就要求分家并且多分家产，替弟弟们打响贤能的知名度。现在我的愿望都已达成，我希望能重新再分家产。”于是把自己以前多取的部分还给了两个弟弟。</p>
<p>所谓经常畅谈山野林泉生活之乐的人，未必就能完全领悟山林的真正乐趣；经常高谈讨厌功名利禄的人，心中未必就完全忘记名利思想。许武得功名利禄，不忘记自己的亲兄弟还在受穷，虽然手法有点偏激，但是那份礼让之心还是很令人敬佩的！</p>
<p>花茂谷艳幻，木落崖枯真</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>莺花茂而谷艳山浓，总是乾坤之幻境①；水木落②而崖枯石瘦，才见天地之真吾③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①幻境：虚空之境。</p>
<p>②水木落：秋天时节，天气干燥，山水干涸，树叶凋落。水，泉水。</p>
<p>③真吾：我本来的面目。朱熹《四时读书乐》：“木落水尽千崖枯，迥然我亦见真吾。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>春天一到百花盛开百鸟齐鸣，即为山谷平添了无限迷人景色，然而这种鸟语花香的艳丽风光，只不过是大自然的一种幻象；秋天一到泉水干涸树叶凋落，山涧中的石头呈现干枯状态，然而这种山川的一片荒凉，才正好能看见天地的本来面貌。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>金圣叹在《临江仙》一词中叹道：“滚滚长江东逝水，浪花淘尽英雄，是非成败转头空，青山依旧在，几度夕阳红，白发渔樵江渚上，惯看秋月春风，一壶浊酒喜相逢，古今多少事，都付笑谈中。”</p>
<p>再看《列子•天瑞》篇中的描述：虹霓呀，云雾呀，风雨呀，四季呀，这些是气候在天空积聚所形成的现象。山岳呀，河海呀，金石呀，火木呀，这些是有形之物聚积于地所形成的。知道是气体的积聚，知道是土块的积聚，为什么说它不会坏？天和地是宇宙中的小东西，还有最大的物体，难得穷究，难得透彻，本来如此；难得推测，难得了解，也本来如此。忧愁它会坏的，难免忧愁得太远；认为它不会坏的，也未必正确。天和地不会不坏，总有一天会坏，碰到要坏的时候，怎么不忧愁呢？</p>
<p>列子说：“说天地会坏是荒谬，说天地不会坏的也荒谬。会坏和不会坏是我所不知道的。纵使这样，坏是一种可能，不会坏也是一种可能，所以活着不知道死亡是什么情况，死者又不知活着的情况，出生不知终结，终结不知开始。会坏和不会坏，我何必放在心里呢？”</p>
<p>岁月本来长，而忙者自促</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>岁月本长，而忙者自促；天地本宽，而鄙者自隘；风花雪月①自闲，而劳攘②者自冗③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①风花雪月：本指四季景色的变化，此处喻指无关天下之事。</p>
<p>②劳攘：形体的劳碌，精神的困扰。</p>
<p>③冗：多而无用。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>自然界的岁月本来很长，可是那些奔波忙碌的人却自己觉得时间很短促；自然界的天地本来很宽广辽阔，可是那些心胸狭窄的人却把自己局限在小圈子里；春花秋月本来是供人欣赏调剂身心的，可是那些奔波劳碌的人却认为是一种多余无益的东西。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>宋朝秦桧修建格天阁时，有个任职江南的官员想别出新裁，好巴结秦桧，就重金贿赂建筑工人，取得厅堂的尺寸，特别定做绒毯献给秦桧。由于绒毯的尺寸大小恰到好处，秦桧认为这名官员打探他府中隐私，非常生气，常借事斥责这名官员。</p>
<p>明朝人周忱任江南巡抚期间，正值大宦官王振当权。周文襄怕王振借机刁难，因此当王振兴建宅第时，周文襄事先要人暗中测量厅堂的大小宽窄，然后命人到松江按尺寸定做地毯送给王振作为贺礼。由于尺寸大小丝毫不差，王振非常高兴。以后，凡是周文襄所呈报的公文，都在王振的赞同下顺利通过。江南的百姓到今天还蒙受这福泽。</p>
<p>同样是呈献绒毯，结果却一怒一喜，这是什么原因呢？有人认为这是忠奸不同，所以各得其不同的报应。其实，王振虽然骄横、暴虐但心机并不深沉；秦桧则阴险狡诈心机重。王振喜欢招抚君子获致名声；秦桧却是怕遭谋刺，所以心胸狭窄以小人心严防众人，这才是结果不同的原因。</p>

<p>心中无物欲，座中有琴书</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>心无物欲，便成霁海秋空；座有琴书，即是丹丘①石室②。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①丹丘：仙人住的地方。</p>
<p>②石室：珍藏贵重物品或书籍的地方。喻指仙人住的地方。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>一个人心中没有物欲，他的胸怀就会像秋天的碧空和平静的大海那样开朗；一个人闲居无事有琴书陪伴消遣，生活就像神仙一般逍遥自在。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>长沙和尚一日在山中小径上信然漫步，兴致盎然。回到寺院门前时，首座问道：“师父，你到哪里去了？”长沙答道：“到山里散步去了。”首座又问：“去到何处？”长沙随吟一偈：“去随芳草，归逐落花。”何等悠然自得的无心化境。这种境界超越了无功用、无作之作的境界。首座又道：“真是春风得意，长庭信步啊！”道得极为真切，可见底蕴不浅。长沙答道：“胜于秋露滴荷叶啊！”答得也极为巧妙，暗中压过了首座自以为得意的底蕴。既舒心，又自然，一个与美好的自然化为一体的禅师形象活脱脱呈现在我们眼前。</p>
<p>《庄子•外物》中也有段耐人寻味的话，庄子说：“眼睛敏锐叫做明，耳朵灵敏叫做聪，鼻子灵敏叫做膻，口感灵敏叫做甘，心灵透彻叫做智，聪明贯达叫做德。大凡道德总不希望有所壅塞，壅塞就会出现梗阻，梗阻而不能排除就会出现相互践踏，相互践踏那么各种祸害就会随之而起。物类有知觉靠的是气息，假如气息不盛，那么绝不是自然禀赋的过失。自然的真性贯穿万物，日夜不停，可是人们却反而堵塞自身的孔窍。腹腔中有许多空旷之处因而能容受五脏怀藏胎儿，内心虚空便会没有拘系地顺应自然而游乐。屋里没有虚空感，婆媳之间就会争吵不休；内心不能虚空而且游心于自然，那么六种感官就会出现纷扰。森林与山丘之所以适宜于人，也是因为人们内心促狭、心神不爽。”</p>
<p>达撒手悬崖，俗沉身苦海</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>笙①歌正沸处，便自拂②然长往，见达人撒手悬崖；更漏已残③时，犹然夜行不休④，笑俗士沉身苦海⑤。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①笙：乐器名。</p>
<p>②拂衣长往：毫不留恋。</p>
<p>③更漏已残：古代计时将一夜分为五更，漏是古代用来计时的仪器，更漏已残是形容夜已深沉。</p>
<p>④夜行不止：此指应酬繁忙。</p>
<p>⑤苦海：据《法华经•寿量品》说：“我见诸众生没在苦海。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>当歌舞盛宴到最高潮时，就自行整理衣衫毫不留恋地离开，那些胸怀广阔的人就能在这种紧要处猛回头，真是令人羡慕；夜深人静仍然忙着应酬的人，已经坠入无边痛苦中而不自觉，说来真是可笑。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>孔子说，《关睢》这样的诗，快乐而不过分，悲哀而不伤人。郑国一带的音乐不是这样，它们轻柔靡曼，特别能诱惑人，破坏了正大堂皇的雅乐的感化作用，十分可恶。《札记•乐记》记载魏文侯聚精会神地听古代音乐，还唯恐打瞌睡，而听郑国和卫国的音乐，则从不知疲倦。</p>
<p>《五经异义》记载：郑的风俗，男女常在溱河、洧川边聚会，唱歌互相表达和缔结爱情。《白虎通•礼乐》记载：郑国人民在山上居住，在河里洗澡，男女混杂，唱恋歌互相挑逗取悦。我们从这些记载，可以了解“郑声”的音调与辞音究竟是什么样子的。它们表现男女间相互倾慕的感情，曲调妙曼，歌词淫靡，二者配合，十分诱人。</p>
<p>然而，“花要半开，酒要半醉”，才能享受到其中的真正乐趣。反之假如酒喝到烂醉如泥，不但不是享乐反而是受罪，生活中不可整天酒山肉海，整天忙于交际应酬使自己隐于庸俗，而是要学会控制自己的欲望以免乐极生悲。做事勿待兴尽，用力勿至极限，适可而止，恰到好处才最为理想。</p>
<p>乐栽花种竹，烦恼还乌有</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>损之又损①，栽花种竹，尽交还乌有先生②；忘无可忘，煮茗焚香，总不问白衣童子③。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①损之又损；减少。老子《道德经》中有：“为学日益，为道日损，损之又损，以至无为。”</p>
<p>②乌有先生：典出《史记•司马相如》中的“乌有先生乌有此事齐之为难”，司马相如《子虚赋》以子虚、乌有先生、亡是公三虚构人物为主角，这就是通常所说的“子虚乌有”。</p>
<p>③不问白衣童子：并不问送酒的白衣人是何许人，比喻已经进入完全忘我状态。《续晋阳秋》：“陶潜常于九月九无酒于宅东篱之下，菊丛之中摘菊盈把，坐于其侧，未几，望见白衣人至，乃为王弘送酒，即便就酌，醉而后归。”</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>生活中的物质欲望要减少到最低限度，每天种些花栽些竹培养生活情趣，把世间的一切烦恼都交还乌有先生忘到九霄云外；脑海中已经了无烦恼没有什么可以忘记的东西，每天就面对着佛坛烧香提着水壶烹茶，自然会使自己进入完全忘我境界。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>无为、修省并不是和世事绝缘。做事不宜提倡形式主义，关键是思想上要达到忘我之境。栽花种竹、焚香煮若、闲云野鹤的生活可以忘我，可以隔去人世间许多烦恼；谈书论道潜心研究学问，也可使一个人完全进入忘我状态，孔子说：“发愤忘食，乐以忘忧，不知老之将至。”人之忘我境界，不能以形式而论，要从本质上看。荀子也说，一个人没有精诚专一的志向，不可能通达事理，没有忘我修炼的行为，不可能有显赫的成果。</p>
<p>元顺帝天顺年间，有一名进士叫陈音，倾心经术，不问世事，终于学有所成。他专心致志的故事，流传至今。一天，陈音整理书籍，发现一张宴贴，就如期赴宴。到朋友家，久坐不走，朋友问他有什么事，陈音说，前来赴宴。那朋友莫名其妙，又不便详问，只得备酒款待。事后，那朋友才想起，去年的今天曾宴请过他。还有一次，陈音朝罢归来，途中说要拜访一同僚。侍从没有听清，仍牵马回家，陈音以为到了同僚的家。步入客厅，环顾四周，陈音说：“格局与我家相同。”又看见壁画，顿生疑窦：“我家之画怎样挂在这里？”恰好家童出来，陈音呵斥道：“你怎么在这里？”家童回答：“这本是你的家嘛！”陈音这才恍然大悟。</p>
<p>松涧边独行，竹窗下高卧</p>
<p>原文</p>
<p>松涧边携杖独行，立处云生破衲①；竹窗下枕书高卧，觉时月浸寒毡。</p>
<p>注释</p>
<p>①衲：和尚穿的衣服，这里借指宽大的衣服。</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>在长着松树的山涧边扶着手杖独自缓步而行，随处可见的云雾仿佛从破旧的衲衣中飘出来的一样；在竹制的窗下枕着书卷放心而眠，醒来时月色已照到了单薄的毡被上。</p>
<p>解读</p>
<p>“松涧边携杖独行，竹窗下枕书高卧”，充满了老庄无为的人生观。《庄子•知北游》中啮缺向被衣求教时的描述同样体现了这种无为的意境。</p>
<p>啮缺向被衣请教道，被衣说：“你得端正你的形体，集中你的视力，自然和气便会到来；收敛你的心智，集中你的思忖，精神就会来你这里停留。玄德将为你而显得美好，大道将居处于你的心中，你那瞪着圆眼稚气无邪的样子就像初生的小牛犊而不会去探求外在的事物！”</p>
<p>被衣话还没说完，啮缺便已睡着。被衣见了十分高兴，唱着歌儿离去，说：“身形犹如枯骸，内心犹如死灰，朴实的心思返归本真，而且并不因为这些缘故而有所矜持，浑浑噩噩，昏昏暗暗，没有心计而不能与之共谋。那将是什么样的人啊！”</p>
<p>上述道理和镜清和尚同弟子们的这段对话一样。镜清和尚问他门下的僧人说：“对面是什么声音？”僧人回答：“是下雨声。”镜清感慨地说：“众生迷失了自己，去外界追求俗物。”僧人问：“那么，老师是怎样做的呢？”“我差一点迷失了自己。”“请教师尊，到底是什么意思呢？”“达到解脱尚不太难，而要说出解脱的真实心境就不太容易了。”通常人皆持入境之见，认为境处在人的对立面，实际上，这种把人与境、主观与客观分解成二物加以对立的看法本身就是一种谬误。禅则不是这样。在禅中，人应与境合一，物我相忘，没入盖天盖地的雨声里。此时合二为一，便能体会到真人与真如，进入化境。</p>

<p>众人忧乐情，君子忧乐理</p>
<p>盖悔愧二字，能去恶迁善</p>
<p>路窄留人行，味浓让人食</p>
<p>宠利毋居前，德业毋落后</p>
<p>处世让一步，待人宽一分</p>
<p>美名不独任，污名不全推</p>
<p>处治世宜方，处乱世当圆</p>
<p>念过而忘功，记恩而忘怨</p>
<p>为恶畏人知，恶中犹有善</p>
<p>只逆来顺受，且居安思危</p>
<p>宁守默毋躁，宁守拙毋巧</p>
<p>不责人小过，不发人阴私</p>
<p>直节使人忌，无恶致人毁</p>
<p>毋偏信自任，毋炫耀忌能</p>
<p>且莫轻输心，应须谨防口</p>
<p>戒疏于虑者，警伤于察者</p>
<p>毋私小伤大，毋借公快私</p>
<p>亲善不预扬，去恶不先发</p>
<p>功过不可混，恩仇勿太明</p>
<p>恶显者祸浅，善显者功小</p>
<p>贫不能济物，出言亦助人</p>
<p>作人须真恳，涉世须圆活</p>
<p>恩自淡而浓，威自严而宽</p>
<p>休与小人仇，休向君子媚</p>
<p>用人不宜刻，交友不宜滥</p>
<p>朴鲁胜练达，疏狂胜曲谨</p>
<p>风斜雨急处，要立得脚定</p>
<p>受一时寂寞，毋万古凄凉</p>
<p>当藏巧于拙，须寓清于浊</p>
<p>经世篇</p>
<p>启人因其明，移风因其易</p>
<p>随时善救时，混俗能脱俗</p>
<p>世事力担当，又要善摆脱</p>
<p>思林下风味，权势念自轻</p>
<p>因势利导之，救时应变法</p>
<p>救败慎策鞭，图成不停棹</p>
<p>如沤生大海，如影灭长空</p>
<p>不贪钩下饵，能解笼中囮</p>
<p>志士勇奋翼，达人早回头</p>
<p>少壮当用意，衰老宜忘情</p>
<p>饮酒莫酩酊，看花勿离披</p>
<p>以势利害人，以势利自毙</p>
<p>知处阴敛翼，巉岩亦坦途</p>
<p>矜消盖世功，改补弥天过</p>
<p>居轩冕之中，有山林之气</p>
<p>无过便是功，无怨便是德</p>
<p>事穷原初心，功成观末路</p>
<p>富贵宜宽厚，聪明宜敛藏</p>
<p>退一步之法，让三分之功</p>
<p>待小人不恶，待君子有礼</p>
<p>读书见圣贤，居官爱子民</p>
<p>祸起于玩忽，功败于细微</p>
<p>君子立好言，君子行好事</p>
<p>愿种德施惠，勿贪权市宠</p>
<p>敦旧扶公议，谨庸种阴德</p>
<p>不犯公正论，不走权门窦</p>
<p>当锄奸杜幸，须留他去路</p>
<p>事业随身毁，精神万古新</p>
<p>谢世于盛时，居身于独后</p>
<p>建功多虚圆，失机必执拗</p>
<p>畏大无逸心，畏小无横名</p>
<p>径路窄退步，滋味短清淡</p>
<p>进步思退步，着手图放手</p>
<p>世态倏忽变，不宜认太真</p>
<p>近势利不染，知智巧不用</p>
<p>燠趋寒则弃，人情之通患</p>
<p>闻牧唱樵歌，述嘉言懿行</p>
<p>人奉不必喜，人侮不须怒</p>
<p>无事宜寂寂，有事宜惺惺</p>
<p>谗夫之毁士，如寸云蔽日</p>
<p>盈满勿再加，危急勿再搦</p>
<p>居官人难见，居乡人易见</p>
<p>中材多猜疑，事事难下手</p>
<p>伏久飞必高，开先谢必早</p>
<p>造物之钓饵，人世之机阱</p>
<p>一事起害生，以无事为福</p>
<p>爵不笼无欲，鼎不加远引</p>
<p>争高得还失，忙过寿亦夭</p>
<p>高车嫌地僻，驷马喜门高</p>
<p>勿趋炎附势，甘栖适守逸</p>
<p>林中无荣辱，义路泯炎凉</p>
<p>意气期天下，肝胆照天下</p>
<p>济饥饿之人，胜结纳贤豪</p>
<p>先达笑弹冠，相知犹按剑</p>
<p>业不必求满，功不必求盈</p>
<p>不为君相笼，不受造化铸</p>
<p>修行木石念，经邦云水趣</p>
<p>志以淡泊明，节从肥甘丧</p>
<p>能察能不察，能胜能不胜</p>
<p>入世悉世外，出世先谙世</p>
<p>治家篇</p>
<p>养子如养女，最要谨慎严</p>
<p>融性情偏私，消家庭嫌隙</p>
<p>悠闲镇定士，宽洪长厚家</p>
<p>家庭有真佛，日用有真道</p>
<p>念积累之难，思倾覆之易</p>
<p>警家人之过，如春风解冻</p>
<p>处骨肉从容，遇朋友剀切</p>
<p>父慈与子孝，俱合当如是</p>
<p>富贵更炎凉，骨肉尤妒忌</p>
<p>居官惟公廉，居家惟恕俭</p>
<p>当穷愁寥落，不可自废弛</p>
<p>寒微之颂德，骨肉之孚心</p>
<p>饮宴之乐多，不是好人家</p>
<p>看破与认真，脱缰负重任</p>
<p>养喜神招福，去杀机远祸</p>
<p>过俭为鄙吝，过让为曲礼</p>
<p>心宽舒福厚，念迫促泽短</p>
<p>除热恼身清，遣穷愁心乐</p>
<p>少事之为福，多心之为祸</p>
<p>富贵嗜欲猛，宜带清冷气</p>
<p>念虑差毫末，人品星渊别</p>
<p>耳闻逆耳言，心有拂心事</p>
<p>天地有和气，人心有喜神</p>
<p>清冷受享薄，和暖福泽厚</p>
<p>念头存宽厚，春风育万物</p>
<p>寒灯敝裘下，不失本来真</p>
<p>肯休当下休，觅了无了时</p>
<p>热闹出冷言，寒微用热心</p>
<p>无事常提防，有事须镇定</p>
<p>少年抑躁心，老成振惰气</p>
<p>柔弱胜刚强，圆融胜偏执</p>
<p>福来不必喜，祸来不必忧</p>
<p>贫贱难用情，富贵难好礼</p>
<p>瑰奇多惹祸，寻常享民福</p>
<p>眼前田地宽，身后惠泽长</p>
<p>富贵知贫贱，少壮念衰老</p>
<p>爱重反为仇，薄极反成喜</p>
<p>耳不留是非，心不着物我</p>
<p>忧勤与淡泊，勿太苦与枯</p>
<p>燥寡凝滞者，功业福祉难</p>
<p>出世篇</p>
<p>看个色身破，认个法身真</p>
<p>万物原一辙，万物本一体</p>
<p>人精爽通天，天威命寓人</p>
<p>俗情须摆脱，物累应减除</p>
<p>君子居常好，不浓亦不枯</p>
<p>事来心始现，事去心随空</p>
<p>机里又藏机，智巧何足恃</p>
<p>知心体莹然，不失人本来</p>
<p>会得个中趣，破得眼前机</p>
<p>肃杀存生意，可见天地心</p>
<p>世事如棋局，不着是高手</p>
<p>昂藏老鹤饥，饮啄态犹闲</p>
<p>识造化幻境，觅人物根宗</p>
<p>静处观人事，闲中玩物情</p>
<p>看破有尽身，悟入无怀境</p>
<p>人之有生也，如太仓粒米</p>
<p>觑鹬蚌兔犬，令人猛气消</p>
<p>苦乐无二境，迷悟非两心</p>
<p>物物见天心，时时观妙道</p>
<p>扫地白云起，才著便起障</p>
<p>莫受造化戏，天地任我锤</p>
<p>若非上上智，便无了了心</p>
<p>视富贵浮云，不必岩穴栖</p>
<p>不为法空缠，身心两自在</p>
<p>机闲一日遥，意宽斗室广</p>
<p>矜名输逃名，练事输省事</p>
<p>去留无所系，静躁不相干</p>
<p>盖心无染着，欲境是仙都</p>
<p>若静躁稍分，则昏明顿异</p>
<p>身常放闲处，不受荣辱遣</p>
<p>我不希荣贵，何忧利禄饵</p>
<p>多藏亡则厚，高步颠则疾</p>
<p>知身不是我，烦恼更何侵</p>
<p>猛兽易伏也，人心难降哉</p>
<p>心地无风涛，随在皆青山</p>
<p>当年歌舞地，今败砌荒台</p>
<p>飞蛾投夜烛，鸱鸮嗜腐鼠</p>
<p>冷观观世人，冷情当世事</p>
<p>徇绝欲俱苦，听吾自修持</p>
<p>好名利不殊，焦声思无异</p>
<p>性天须澄澈，心地勿沉迷</p>
<p>人心有真境，忘虑得以游</p>
<p>俗眼观世异，道眼观世常</p>
<p>缠脱在自心，心了见真境</p>
<p>以我转物者，大地尽逍遥</p>
<p>思生前死后，超物游象先</p>
<p>歌残妍丑消，棋尽雌雄空</p>
<p>一身了一身，天下还天下</p>
<p>人生是傀儡，要把柄在手</p>
<p>造化与人心，混合无间也</p>
<p>山居胸次清，触物皆佳思</p>
<p>不落世情窠，在世出世法</p>
<p>静中念澄澈，见心之真体</p>
<p>鱼得水忘水，识此超物累</p>
<p>识天地鸣佩，见乾坤妙文</p>
<p>得喧见寂趣，悟有入无机</p>
<p>固浓不胜淡，俗不如雅也</p>
<p>得诗家真趣，悟禅教玄机</p>
<p>释氏之随缘，吾儒之素位</p>
<p>任幻形凋谢，识本性真如</p>
<p>养生篇</p>
<p>爽口味五分，快心事五分</p>
<p>知有生之乐，怀虚生之忧</p>
<p>悉利害之情，绝利害之虑</p>
<p>只和气浑然，是居身之宝</p>
<p>忙里要偷闲，闲中要取静</p>
<p>雨余观山色，夜静听钟声</p>
<p>昼闲听鸟语，夜静看云舒</p>
<p>醉倒落花前，天地为衾枕</p>
<p>拂意事休言，会心处独赏</p>
<p>土床石枕冷，拥衾梦魂爽</p>
<p>扫浓淡之见，灭欣厌之情</p>
<p>富贵死负重，贫贱死释重</p>
<p>识疏狂足贵，知淡泊为真</p>
<p>觉鹏程窄小，知鹤梦悠闲</p>
<p>观翠红青白，得诗料禅机</p>
<p>空拳握古今，握住当放手</p>
<p>疑好事皆虚，信闲人是福</p>
<p>世事勿扼腕，人生且舒眉</p>
<p>霜天闻鹤唳，雪夜听鸡鸣</p>
<p>烹茗听瓶声，炉内识阴阳</p>
<p>园圃看蜂忙，觑尘情世态</p>
<p>会心不在远，得趣不在多</p>
<p>心与竹俱空，是非不著脚</p>
<p>养志于清修，栖心于淡泊</p>
<p>拥飞花落絮，坐锦绣团裀</p>
<p>想屈原激烈，会陶潜风流</p>
<p>黄鸟呼醉客，白云媚幽人</p>
<p>栖蓬神情旷，结翁意念真</p>
<p>曰尘世苦海，彼心自尘苦</p>
<p>高形逸神劳，下形劳神逸</p>
<p>奢者富不足，俭者贫有余</p>
<p>无名位乐真，无饥寒忧甚</p>
<p>勿争长竞短，勿较雌论雄</p>
<p>常忧死虑病，可消幻长道</p>
<p>贪得者乞丐，知足者王公</p>
<p>杯中吟风月，躲万丈红尘</p>
<p>闲看花开落，漫随云卷舒</p>
<p>羡山林之乐，未必得林趣</p>
<p>花茂谷艳幻，木落崖枯真</p>
<p>岁月本来长，而忙者自促</p>
<p>心中无物欲，座中有琴书</p>
<p>达撒手悬崖，俗沉身苦海</p>
<p>乐栽花种竹，烦恼还乌有</p>
<p>松涧边独行，竹窗下高卧</p>

<p>
        The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see
        him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
        handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
        known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it
        somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.
      </p>

        “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name
        a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through
        ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of
        the word, you deliver that which is not true.” —<i>Hackluyt.</i>

        “WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. <i>hval</i>. This animal is named from roundness or

<h2>
        EXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).
      </h2>
<p>
        It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a
        poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans
        and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to
        whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
        Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the
        higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these
        extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the
        ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these
        extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing
        bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
        and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our
        own.
      </p>
<p>
        So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou
        belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world
        will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong;
        but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;
        and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes
        and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—Give
        it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the
        world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I
        could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down
        your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your
        friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,
        and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael,
        against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there,
        ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!

        “While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they cut off his

        “We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The
        Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but that
        is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they
        can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains....
        I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of
        herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me that he caught
        once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.” —<i>A Voyage to
        Greenland, A.D.</i> 1671. <i>Harris Coll</i>.

        “Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one
        eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was

<h2>
      CHAPTER 1. Loomings.
    </h2>
<p>
      Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
      little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
      shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
      the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
      circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
      it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
      involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
      of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
      upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
      from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
      people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
      as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
      flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
      There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
      in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
      towards the ocean with me.
    </p>
<p>
      There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
      as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf.
      Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is
      the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by
      breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the
      crowds of water-gazers there.
    </p>
<p>
      Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
      Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do
      you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
      thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
      leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking
      over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as
      if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all
      landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters,
      nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green
      fields gone? What do they here?
    </p>
<p>
      But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
      seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
      extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
      warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
      they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of
      them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,
      streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all
      unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses
      of all those ships attract them thither?
    </p>
<p>
      Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
      almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,
      and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let
      the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand
      that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead
      you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be
      athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan
      happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one
      knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
    </p>
<p>
      But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
      quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
      the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,
      each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and
      here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder
      cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,
      reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.
      But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes
      down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain,
      unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go
      visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
      knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there
      is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would
      you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of
      Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate
      whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a
      pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy
      with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to
      sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such
      a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
      of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the
      Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this
      is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of
      Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he
      saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image,
      we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the
      ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to
      grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do
      not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to
      go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag
      unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow
      quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves
      much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though
      I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a
      Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to
      those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable
      toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as
      much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships,
      barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though
      I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of
      officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though
      once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,
      there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say
      reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous
      dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse,
      that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the
      pyramids.
    </p>
<p>
      No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
      plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True,
      they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like
      a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is
      unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor, particularly if you
      come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or
      Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting
      your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country
      schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition
      is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires
      a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear
      it. But even this wears off in time.
    </p>
<p>
      What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
      and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I
      mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
      Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
      respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t a
      slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me
      about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
      satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one
      way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or
      metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed
      round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be
      content.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying
      me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I
      ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there
      is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act
      of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two
      orchard thieves entailed upon us. But <i>being paid</i>,—what will compare
      with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really
      marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root
      of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
      Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
    </p>
<p>
      Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise
      and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are
      far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate
      the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the
      quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the
      forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same
      way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same
      time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after
      having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it
      into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer
      of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs
      me, and influences me in some unaccountable way—he can better answer
      than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed
      part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time
      ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more
      extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
      something like this:
    </p>
<p>
      “<i>Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.</i>
      “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”
     </p>
<p>
      Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
      Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others
      were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy
      parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot
      tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I
      think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being
      cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about
      performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it
      was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating
      judgment.
    </p>
<p>
      Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
      himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.
      Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the
      undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending
      marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to
      my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been
      inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for
      things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous
      coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and
      could still be social with it—would they let me—since it is
      but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one
      lodges in.
    </p>
<p>
      By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
      flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that
      swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul,
      endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand
      hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.
    </h2>
<p>
      I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,
      and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old
      Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in
      December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for
      Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would
      offer, till the following Monday.
    </p>
<p>
      As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
      this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be
      related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up
      to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine,
      boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old
      island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late
      been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this
      matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her
      great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the
      first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did
      those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give
      chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first
      adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
      cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in
      order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
      bowsprit?
    </p>
<p>
      Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in
      New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter
      of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very
      dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and
      cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded
      my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So, wherever
      you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary
      street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with
      the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may
      conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the
      price, and don’t be too particular.
    </p>
<p>
      With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The
      Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
      Further on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there
      came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
      ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten
      inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
      when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard,
      remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.
      Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the
      broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
      within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from
      before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I
      now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,
      doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.
    </p>
<p>
      Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and
      here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this
      hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town
      proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding
      from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had
      a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so,
      entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the
      porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are
      these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But “The Crossed
      Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then must needs be the sign
      of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
      within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.
    </p>
<p>
      It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
      faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
      Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
      preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and
      wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,
      Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’
    </p>
<p>
      Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,
      and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging
      sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a
      tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath—“The
      Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”
     </p>
<p>
      Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
      thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose
      this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
      the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little
      wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the
      ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
      poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
      spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side
      palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak
      corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling
      than ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,
      is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob
      quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind called
      Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the only
      copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest
      out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or
      whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on
      both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.” True
      enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind—old
      black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this
      body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and
      the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it’s
      too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the
      copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor
      Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow,
      and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both
      ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not
      keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his
      red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What
      a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them
      talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give
      me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
    </p>
<p>
      But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to
      the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than
      here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of
      the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to
      keep out this frost?
    </p>
<p>
      Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
      door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
      moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar
      in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
      temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
    </p>
<p>
      But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is
      plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,
      and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
    </h2>
<p>
      Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,
      straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the
      bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
      oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
      unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study
      and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the
      neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
      purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
      you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
      England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of
      much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
      especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
      entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,
      might not be altogether unwarranted.
    </p>
<p>
      But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
      black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
      blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,
      soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.
      Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity
      about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath
      with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and
      anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s
      the Black Sea in a midnight gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the
      four primal elements.—It’s a blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean
      winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.
      But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in
      the picture’s midst. <i>That</i> once found out, and all the rest were plain. But
      stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the
      great leviathan himself?
    </p>
<p>
      In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly
      based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I
      conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a
      great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three
      dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to
      spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself
      upon the three mast-heads.
    </p>
<p>
      The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array
      of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth
      resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and
      one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment
      made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you
      gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have
      gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed
      with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and
      deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly
      elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a
      sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was
      flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain
      off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like
      a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty
      feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.
    </p>
<p>
      Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut
      through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
      fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier
      place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
      planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
      cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
      old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
      table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
      gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
      further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a
      rude attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the
      vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive
      beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,
      bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another
      cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little
      withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums
      and death.
    </p>
<p>
      Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
      cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses
      deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
      rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
      <i>this</i> mark, and your charge is but a penny; to <i>this</i> a penny more; and so on
      to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for
      a shilling.
    </p>
<p>
      Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a
      table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of <i>skrimshander</i>. I sought
      the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room,
      received for answer that his house was full—not a bed unoccupied.
      “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no objections to
      sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’ a-whalin’,
      so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”
     </p>
<p>
      I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever
      do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he
      (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was
      not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a
      strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any
      decent man’s blanket.
    </p>
<p>
      “I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?
      Supper’ll be ready directly.”
     </p>
<p>
      I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
      Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
      his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
      between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he
      didn’t make much headway, I thought.
    </p>
<p>
      At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining
      room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said
      he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
      winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to
      our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare
      was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but
      dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green
      box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.
    </p>
<p>
      “My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
      sartainty.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the harpooneer
      is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don’t—he
      eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.
    </p>
<p>
      I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark
      complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
      turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed
      before I did.
    </p>
<p>
      Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what
      else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a
      looker on.
    </p>
<p>
      Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
      cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this
      morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we’ll
      have the latest news from the Feegees.”
     </p>
<p>
      A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,
      and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy
      watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all
      bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an
      eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, and
      this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a
      straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled
      little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all
      round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed
      him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a
      sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how
      long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the
      weather side of an ice-island.
    </p>
<p>
      The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with
      the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about
      most obstreperously.
    </p>
<p>
      I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he
      seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
      sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as
      the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had
      ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a
      sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here
      venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in
      height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom
      seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his
      white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his
      eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.
      His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine
      stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
      Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had
      mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more
      of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he
      was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge
      favourite with them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s
      Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
    </p>
<p>
      It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally
      quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little
      plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
    </p>
<p>
      No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
      rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but people
      like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping
      with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that
      stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was
      there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more
      than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than
      bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one
      apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own
      blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
    </p>
<p>
      The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
      thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
      harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
      the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
      Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
      and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how
      could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
    </p>
<p>
      “Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t
      sleep with him. I’ll try the bench here.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a
      mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots
      and notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane
      there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So
      saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first
      dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while
      grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
      plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near
      spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
      bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in
      the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
      shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the
      middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown
      study.
    </p>
<p>
      I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
      short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
      narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than
      the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first
      bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a
      little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found
      that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of
      the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another
      current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both
      together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of
      the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
    </p>
<p>
      The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal a
      march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
      wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
      second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
      morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
      standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
    </p>
<p>
      Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a
      sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began to think that
      after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this
      unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in
      before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become
      jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.
    </p>
<p>
      But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
      and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
    </p>
<p>
      “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep
      such late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.
    </p>
<p>
      The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
      mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered,
      “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes,
      he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling,
      you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be,
      he can’t sell his head.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
      are telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
      landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday
      night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?”
     </p>
<p>
      “That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t sell
      it here, the market’s overstocked.”
     </p>
<p>
      “With what?” shouted I.
    </p>
<p>
      “With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better stop
      spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”
     </p>
<p>
      “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther
      guess you’ll be done <i>brown</i> if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin’
      his head.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this
      unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s broke a’ready,” said he.
    </p>
<p>
      “Broke,” said I—“<i>broke</i>, do you mean?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm—“landlord,
      stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too
      without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can
      only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain
      harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you
      persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending
      to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design
      for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate
      and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak
      out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in
      all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you
      will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if
      true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and
      I’ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, <i>you</i> I mean,
      landlord, <i>you</i>, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would
      thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
      sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,
      this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived from the
      south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand heads (great
      curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and that one he’s
      trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it would not do to
      be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is goin’ to churches.
      He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin’ out of
      the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a
      string of inions.”
     </p>
<p>
      This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
      that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at
      the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
      Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
      business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
    </p>
<p>
      “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful
      late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me
      slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room
      for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,
      afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot
      of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow,
      Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that,
      Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;”
       and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead
      the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he
      exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that harpooneer to-night;
      he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; <i>do</i> come; <i>won’t</i> ye
      come?”
     </p>
<p>
      I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
      ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
      with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
      to sleep abreast.
    </p>
<p>
      “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
      that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make
      yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from
      eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the
      most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced
      round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no
      other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,
      and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not
      properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown
      upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman’s bag, containing the
      harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there
      was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the
      fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
      But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
      light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive
      at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing
      but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags
      something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.
      There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in
      South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer
      would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in
      that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a
      hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as
      though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I
      went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw
      such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I
      gave myself a kink in the neck.
    </p>
<p>
      I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
      head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
      the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
      the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a
      little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half
      undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the
      harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I
      made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then
      blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care
      of heaven.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there
      is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a
      long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly
      made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall
      in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under
      the door.
    </p>
<p>
      Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
      head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
      till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the
      floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of
      the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness
      to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in
      unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when,
      good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,
      yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking
      squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been
      in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But
      at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I
      plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black
      squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I
      knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred
      to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who,
      falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that
      this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with
      a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his
      outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make
      of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,
      and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it
      might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of
      a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the
      middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
      thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his
      hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh
      surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing
      but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head
      now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than
      ever I bolted a dinner.
    </p>
<p>
      Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it
      was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this
      head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance
      is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded
      about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was
      the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.
      In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to
      address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed
      inexplicable in him.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his
      chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with
      the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark
      squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’ War, and just escaped
      from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were
      marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of
      young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage
      or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in
      this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps
      the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens!
      look at that tomahawk!
    </p>
<p>
      But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
      something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that
      he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or
      dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the
      pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a
      hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old Congo baby.
      Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black
      manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that
      it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished
      ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed
      it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and
      removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,
      like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks
      inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very
      appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
    </p>
<p>
      I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill
      at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes
      about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
      them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top
      and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a
      sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and
      still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be
      scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;
      then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it
      to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry
      sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics
      were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who
      seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or
      other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
      At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,
      and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a
      sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
    </p>
<p>
      All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him
      now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and
      jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before
      the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been
      bound.
    </p>
<p>
      But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
      Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an
      instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,
      he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was
      extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang
      into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden
      grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
    </p>
<p>
      Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against
      the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep
      quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural
      responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
    </p>
<p>
      “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I
      kill-e.” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in
      the dark.
    </p>
<p>
      “Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!
      Coffin! Angels! save me!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the
      cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot
      tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But
      thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in
      hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
    </p>
<p>
      “Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t
      harm a hair of your head.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that
      infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads
      around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
      here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you
      sabbee?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
      sitting up in bed.
    </p>
<p>
      “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing
      the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a
      really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all
      his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.
      What’s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself—the
      man’s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me,
      as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a
      drunken Christian.
    </p>
<p>
      “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
      whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn
      in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It’s
      dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”
     </p>
<p>
      This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
      motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to
      say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
     </p>
<p>
      I turned in, and never slept better in my life.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.
    </h2>
<p>
      Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown
      over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought
      I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little
      parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all
      over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of
      which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his keeping his
      arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly
      rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I say, looked for
      all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly
      lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from
      the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
      sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging
      me.
    </p>
<p>
      My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
      child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
      whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The
      circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I
      think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep
      do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all
      the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my mother
      dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though
      it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day
      in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help
      for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,
      undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a
      bitter sigh got between the sheets.
    </p>
<p>
      I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
      before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of
      my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in
      at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the
      sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse—at
      last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet,
      sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet,
      beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my
      misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an
      unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of
      stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay
      there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since,
      even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen
      into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it—half
      steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was
      now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through
      all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a
      supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,
      and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand
      belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled
      on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag
      away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single
      inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness
      at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly
      remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost
      myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very
      hour, I often puzzle myself with it.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
      supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
      those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm
      thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly
      recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the
      comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his
      bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me
      tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to
      rouse him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then
      rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly
      felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the
      tomahawk sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced
      baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in
      the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the
      name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling,
      and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
      hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
      extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all
      over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff
      as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not
      altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of
      knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I
      lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon
      narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed
      made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it
      were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain
      signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would
      dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole
      apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is
      a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate
      sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially
      polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he
      treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of
      great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette
      motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.
      Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways
      were well worth unusual regarding.
    </p>
<p>
      He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,
      by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his
      boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next
      movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under
      the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
      was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I
      ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
      boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage—neither
      caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his
      outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education was not
      yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree
      civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at
      all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have
      dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with
      his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began
      creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to
      boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones—probably not made to
      order either—rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of
      a bitter cold morning.
    </p>
<p>
      Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
      street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into
      the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg
      made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged
      him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
      particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied,
      and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any
      Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement,
      contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and
      hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on
      the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering
      his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and
      behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long
      wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and
      striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous
      scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is
      using Rogers’s best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the
      less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of
      a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are
      always kept.
    </p>
<p>
      The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
      the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
      harpoon like a marshal’s baton.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.
    </h2>
<p>
      I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
      grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
      though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
      bedfellow.
    </p>
<p>
      However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good
      thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person,
      afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let
      him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the
      man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is
      more in that man than you perhaps think for.
    </p>
<p>
      The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
      night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
      nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and
      sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and
      ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn,
      shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.
    </p>
<p>
      You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
      young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would
      seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from
      his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might
      say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still
      lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; <i>he</i> doubtless has
      tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg?
      which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to
      show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.
    </p>
<p>
      “Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went
      to breakfast.
    </p>
<p>
      They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in
      manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the
      great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men,
      they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere
      crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the
      taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of
      Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s performances—this kind of
      travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
      polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had
      anywhere.
    </p>
<p>
      These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after
      we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good
      stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
      maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
      embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
      slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire
      strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet,
      here they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling,
      all of kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as
      though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
      Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
      whalemen!
    </p>
<p>
      But as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the
      head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
      cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
      cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and
      using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the
      imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.
      But <i>that</i> was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that
      in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
    </p>
<p>
      We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
      coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,
      done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest
      into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there
      quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied
      out for a stroll.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 6. The Street.
    </h2>
<p>
      If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an
      individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized
      town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll
      through the streets of New Bedford.
    </p>
<p>
      In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently
      offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even
      in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes
      jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and
      Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared
      the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these
      last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual
      cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom
      yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.
    </p>
<p>
      But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
      and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
      which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
      more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
      scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and
      glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows
      who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the
      whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In
      some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look there! that
      chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed
      coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here comes another with
      a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.
    </p>
<p>
      No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a
      downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
      two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
      country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
      reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical
      things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he
      orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah,
      poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling
      gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of
      the tempest.
    </p>
<p>
      But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
      bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer
      place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day
      perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it
      is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so
      bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New
      England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land,
      also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the
      spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this,
      nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and
      gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted
      upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?
    </p>
<p>
      Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
      mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses
      and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
      One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of
      the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
    </p>
<p>
      In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
      daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You
      must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they
      have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn
      their lengths in spermaceti candles.
    </p>
<p>
      In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long
      avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and
      bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their
      tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;
      which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces
      of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation’s final
      day.
    </p>
<p>
      And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
      roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is
      perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom
      of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls
      breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as
      though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the
      Puritanic sands.

      CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.
    </h2>
<p>
      In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are the
      moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail
      to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.
    </p>
<p>
      Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
      special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
      sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
      bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a
      small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and widows. A
      muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.
      Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as
      if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not
      yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat
      steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned
      into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like
      the following, but I do not pretend to quote:—
    </p>
<p>
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost
      overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, <i>November</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1836.
      THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.
    </p>
<p>
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER
      CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’ crews OF THE
      SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground
      in the PACIFIC, <i>December</i> 31<i>st</i>, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their
      surviving SHIPMATES.
    </p>
<p>
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows of
      his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, <i>August</i> 3<i>d</i>,
      1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.
    </p>
<p>
      Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself
      near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me.
      Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of
      incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person
      present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who
      could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions
      on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names
      appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many
      are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several
      women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing
      grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose
      unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused
      the old wounds to bleed afresh.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among
      flowers can say—here, <i>here</i> lies my beloved; ye know not the
      desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those
      black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those
      immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the
      lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the
      beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well might those
      tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.
    </p>
<p>
      In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why
      it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales,
      though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to
      his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so
      significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but
      embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the Life
      Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal,
      unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam
      who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be
      comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in
      unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead;
      wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.
      All these things are not without their meanings.
    </p>
<p>
      But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead
      doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
    </p>
<p>
      It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
      Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light
      of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone
      before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew
      merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion,
      it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes,
      there is death in this business of whaling—a speechlessly quick
      chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have
      hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they
      call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in
      looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the
      sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
      Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body
      who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for
      Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave
      my soul, Jove himself cannot.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
    </h2>
<p>
      I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
      robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
      admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
      sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was
      the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a
      very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth,
      but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the
      time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy
      old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering
      youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain
      mild gleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping
      forth even beneath February’s snow. No one having previously heard his
      history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost
      interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities
      about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he
      entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come
      in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and
      his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with
      the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and
      overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an
      adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the
      pulpit.
    </p>
<p>
      Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
      regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,
      seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it
      seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit
      without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those
      used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain
      had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for
      this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a
      mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel
      it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the
      foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of
      the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
      sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the
      steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
    </p>
<p>
      The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with
      swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,
      so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the
      pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these
      joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared
      to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and
      stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step,
      till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little
      Quebec.
    </p>
<p>
      I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
      Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,
      that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of
      the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing;
      furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by
      that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for
      the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for
      replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of
      God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold—a lofty
      Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.
    </p>
<p>
      But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
      borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble
      cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was
      adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against
      a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But
      high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little
      isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s face; and this bright
      face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship’s tossed deck,
      something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory’s plank
      where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel seemed to say, “beat on,
      beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is
      breaking through; the clouds are rolling off—serenest azure is at
      hand.”
     </p>
<p>
      Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had
      achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the
      likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting
      piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed beak.
    </p>
<p>
      What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this
      earth’s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads
      the world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first
      descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the
      God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds. Yes,
      the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the
      pulpit is its prow.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.
    </h2>
<p>
      Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
      the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away to
      larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”
     </p>
<p>
      There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still
      slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every
      eye on the preacher.
    </p>
<p>
      He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his large
      brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a
      prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom
      of the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
      bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he
      commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the
      concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—
    </p>
<pre>
     “The ribs and terrors in the whale,
     Arched over me a dismal gloom,
     While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by,
     And lift me deepening down to doom.
<pre><code> “I saw the opening maw of hell,
 With endless pains and sorrows there;
 Which none but they that feel can tell—
 Oh, I was plunging to despair.

 “In black distress, I called my God,
 When I could scarce believe him mine,
 He bowed his ear to my complaints—
 No more the whale did me confine.

 “With speed he flew to my relief,
 As on a radiant dolphin borne;
 Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
 The face of my Deliverer God.

 “My song for ever shall record
 That terrible, that joyful hour;
 I give the glory to my God,
 His all the mercy and the power.”
</code></pre>
 </pre>
<p>
      Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
      howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
      over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the
      proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first
      chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
      Jonah.’”
     </p>
<p>
      “Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is
      one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet
      what depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
      lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the
      fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods
      surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;
      sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But <i>what</i> is this lesson
      that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a
      lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the
      living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story
      of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift
      punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of
      Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was
      in his wilful disobedience of the command of God—never mind now what
      that command was, or how conveyed—which he found a hard command. But
      all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do—remember
      that—and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.
      And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
      disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.
    </p>
<p>
      “With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God,
      by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry
      him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this
      earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that’s bound
      for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By
      all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.
      That’s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is
      in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed
      in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
      Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast
      of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two
      thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of
      Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee
      world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of
      all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;
      prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the
      seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been
      policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,
      had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no
      baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany
      him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
      finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he
      steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the
      moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s evil eye.
      Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in
      vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the
      mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way,
      one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a widow;” or, “Joe, do
      you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer
      that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers
      from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile
      upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold
      coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of
      his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his
      sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands
      upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his
      face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself
      suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of
      it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised,
      they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out
      his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless
      question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But
      he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye,
      sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man
      now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than
      he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the next coming tide,’ at
      last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon
      enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s
      another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll
      sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage money how much is that?—I’ll
      pay now.’ For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing
      not to be overlooked in this history, ‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere
      the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime
      in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this
      world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a
      passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So
      Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s purse, ere he judge
      him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it’s assented to.
      Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time
      resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah
      fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.
      He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he
      mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. ‘Point out my state-room,
      Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like
      it,’ says the Captain, ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock
      the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling
      there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about
      the doors of convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All
      dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds
      the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
      close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath
      the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that
      stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his
      bowels’ wards.
    </p>
<p>
      “Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates
      in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the
      weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in
      slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the
      room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious
      the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens
      Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and
      this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.
      But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,
      the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in
      me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
      soul are all in crookedness!’
    </p>
<p>
      “Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
      reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
      Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as
      one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,
      praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the
      whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who
      bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there’s naught to
      staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah’s prodigy of
      ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
    </p>
<p>
      “And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
      from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
      glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers!
      the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked
      burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when
      the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars
      are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are
      yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah’s
      head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees
      no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little
      hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with
      open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
      down into the sides of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken
      it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and
      shrieks in his dead ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled
      from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and
      stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at
      that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the
      bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy
      vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning
      while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face
      from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the
      rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again
      towards the tormented deep.
    </p>
<p>
      “Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing
      attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark
      him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,
      fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,
      they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was
      upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then how furiously they
      mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine occupation? Whence comest
      thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior
      of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from;
      whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise
      another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer
      is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God
      of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye,
      well mightest thou fear the Lord God <i>then!</i> Straightway, he now goes on to
      make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
      appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God
      for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,—when
      wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the
      sea, for he knew that for <i>his</i> sake this great tempest was upon them; they
      mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But
      all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised
      invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of
      Jonah.
    </p>
<p>
      “And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when
      instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still,
      as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He
      goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he
      scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws
      awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many
      white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the
      fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For
      sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He
      feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance
      to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and
      pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is
      true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for
      punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in
      the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I
      do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him
      before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to
      repent of it like Jonah.”
     </p>
<p>
      While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting
      storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when
      describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep
      chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring
      elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy
      brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look
      on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
    </p>
<p>
      There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves
      of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed
      eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
    </p>
<p>
      But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
      with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:
    </p>
<p>
      “Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon
      me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah
      teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I
      am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from
      this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as
      you listen, while some one of you reads <i>me</i> that other and more awful
      lesson which Jonah teaches to <i>me</i>, as a pilot of the living God. How being
      an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the
      Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh,
      Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission,
      and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God
      is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon
      him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with
      swift slantings tore him along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the
      eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were
      wrapped about his head,’ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.
      Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of
      hell’—when the whale grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even
      then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God
      spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the
      sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and
      all the delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry
      land;’ when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised
      and beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously
      murmuring of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what
      was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That
      was it!
    </p>
<p>
      “This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the
      living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel
      duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed
      them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe
      to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in
      this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even
      though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot
      Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!”
     </p>
<p>
      He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face
      to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a
      heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
      every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
      than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the
      kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward
      delight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth,
      ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
      arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
      gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
      truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from
      under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant delight
      is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is
      only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the
      billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure
      Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who
      coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath—O Father!—chiefly
      known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal, here I die. I have
      striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s, or mine own. Yet this
      is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live
      out the lifetime of his God?”
     </p>
<p>
      He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
      his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and
      he was left alone in the place.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.
    </h2>
<p>
      Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite
      alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was
      sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and
      in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of
      his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling
      away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.
    </p>
<p>
      But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to
      the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began
      counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page—as
      I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving
      utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then
      begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each
      time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by
      such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment
      at the multitude of pages was excited.
    </p>
<p>
      With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously
      marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance yet
      had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide
      the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces
      of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and
      bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.
      And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan,
      which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man
      who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too,
      that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
      brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I
      will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
      phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded
      me of General Washington’s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It
      had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows,
      which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly
      wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
    </p>
<p>
      Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
      looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,
      never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared
      wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.
      Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous,
      and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me
      upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very
      strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly
      how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm
      self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed
      also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the
      other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no
      desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as
      mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost
      sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the
      way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only way he could get there—thrown
      among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter;
      and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity;
      content with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this
      was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there
      was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we
      mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I
      hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I
      conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his
      digester.”
     </p>
<p>
      As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild
      stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only
      glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the
      casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm
      booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange
      feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and maddened
      hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage had
      redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in
      which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he
      was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself
      mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have
      repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I’ll
      try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but
      hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs
      and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little
      noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last
      night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
      bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a
      little complimented.
    </p>
<p>
      We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him
      the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were
      in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to
      jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in
      this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch
      and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging
      puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between
      us.
    </p>
<p>
      If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s
      breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left
      us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I
      to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine,
      clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married;
      meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would
      gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this sudden flame
      of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much
      distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.
    </p>
<p>
      After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
      together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous
      tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty
      dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically
      dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and
      said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by
      pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay. He then went
      about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper
      fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for
      me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a
      moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
      I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
      Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
      worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you
      suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth—pagans
      and all included—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of
      black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do the will of God—<i>that</i>
      is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do to my fellow man what
      I would have my fellow man to do to me—<i>that</i> is the will of God. Now,
      Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do
      to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.
      Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn
      idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little
      idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or
      thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at
      peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to
      sleep without some little chat.
    </p>
<p>
      How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
      disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very
      bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and
      chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts’
      honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.
    </h2>
<p>
      We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
      Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over
      mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy
      were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little
      nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting
      up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began
      to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up;
      the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our
      four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them,
      as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more
      so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too,
      seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because
      truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for
      there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by
      contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are
      all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be
      said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,
      the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why
      then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and
      unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be
      furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the
      rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but
      the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.
      Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic
      crystal.
    </p>
<p>
      We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
      once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by
      day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
      keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of
      being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except
      his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our
      essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening
      my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness
      into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
      twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I
      at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to
      strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a
      strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,
      that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed
      the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love
      once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have
      Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such
      serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the
      landlord’s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed
      confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
      friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed
      the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
      hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
      distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and,
      eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly
      complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his
      words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with
      his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as
      it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 12. Biographical.
    </h2>
<p>
      Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
      South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.
    </p>
<p>
      When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
      grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
      sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire
      to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His
      father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the
      maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable
      warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal stuff; though
      sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
      untutored youth.
    </p>
<p>
      A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage
      to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen,
      spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence could
      prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a
      distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted
      the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of
      land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding
      his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he
      sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding
      by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of
      his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing
      himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and
      swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.
    </p>
<p>
      In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass
      over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged
      not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit
      Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make
      himself at home. But this fine young savage—this sea Prince of
      Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down among the sailors,
      and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the
      shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if
      thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored
      countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he was actuated by a
      profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make
      his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better
      than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him
      that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more
      so, than all his father’s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and
      seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and
      seeing how they spent their wages in <i>that</i> place also, poor Queequeg gave
      it up for lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die
      a pagan.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
      wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
      ways about him, though now some time from home.
    </p>
<p>
      By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a
      coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being
      very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and
      added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted
      him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings
      before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as soon as he
      felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to sail
      about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a
      harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.
    </p>
<p>
      I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
      movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
      this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
      intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for
      an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany
      me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,
      the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with
      both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all
      this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for
      Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to
      be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the
      mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to
      merchant seamen.
    </p>
<p>
      His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced
      me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we
      rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were
      sleeping.

      CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.
    </h2>
<p>
      Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
      for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my
      comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
      amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me
      and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories
      about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
      whom I now companied with.
    </p>
<p>
      We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor
      carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to
      “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As
      we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much—for
      they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at
      seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not,
      going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then
      stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he
      carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling
      ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied,
      that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular
      affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried
      in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In
      short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers’
      meadows armed with their own scythes—though in no wise obliged to
      furnish them—even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons,
      preferred his own harpoon.
    </p>
<p>
      Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
      the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners
      of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest
      to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing—though
      in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage
      the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then
      shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,” said I, “Queequeg,
      you might have known better than that, one would think. Didn’t the people
      laugh?”
     </p>
<p>
      Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko,
      it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young
      cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this
      punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where
      the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at
      Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very stately
      punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this commander was
      invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a pretty young princess
      just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at
      the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned
      the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between
      the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being
      said,—for those people have their grace as well as we—though
      Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our
      platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the
      great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest
      opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is,
      dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the
      blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and
      noting the ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as
      having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s
      own house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
      punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said
      Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”
     </p>
<p>
      At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.
      Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford
      rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the
      clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled
      upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay
      silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of
      carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt
      the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one
      most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second
      ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the
      endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.
    </p>
<p>
      Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
      Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.
      How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike earth!—that
      common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs;
      and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no
      records.
    </p>
<p>
      At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His
      dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On,
      on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast;
      ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning,
      we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall
      masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this
      reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some
      time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a
      lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
      companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
      whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by
      their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all
      verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind
      his back. I thought the bumpkin’s hour of doom was come. Dropping his
      harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
      miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;
      then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with
      bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,
      lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.
    </p>
<p>
      “Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
      “Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Hallo, <i>you</i> sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,
      stalking up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you
      know you might have killed that chap?”
     </p>
<p>
      “What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
    </p>
<p>
      “He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing to
      the still shivering greenhorn.
    </p>
<p>
      “Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
      expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so
      small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e <i>you</i>, you cannibal, if you try
      any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”
     </p>
<p>
      But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
      mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the
      weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side,
      completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow
      whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were
      in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed
      madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking
      of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into
      splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;
      those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it
      were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this
      consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under
      the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the
      bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the
      boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that
      way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and
      while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to
      the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For
      three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long
      arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders
      through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but
      saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself
      perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance
      around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and
      disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking
      out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked
      them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble
      trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg
      like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.
    </p>
<p>
      Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at
      all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only
      asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off;
      that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against
      the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to
      himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
      cannibals must help these Christians.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.
    </h2>
<p>
      Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
      fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
    </p>
<p>
      Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the
      world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than
      the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of
      sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than you
      would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
      gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
      don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to
      send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of
      wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome;
      that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the
      shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades
      in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like
      Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way
      inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to
      their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering,
      as to the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that
      Nantucket is no Illinois.
    </p>
<p>
      Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled
      by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down
      upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his
      talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight
      over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same direction.
      Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the
      island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,—the poor little
      Indian’s skeleton.
    </p>
<p>
      What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take
      to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in the
      sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
      experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
      launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
      put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
      Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting
      war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most
      monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon,
      clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very
      panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious
      assaults!
    </p>
<p>
      And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
      their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so
      many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and
      Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add
      Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all
      India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this
      terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea is his; he owns it,
      as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through
      it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating
      forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen
      the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like
      themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep
      itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone,
      in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as
      his own special plantation. <i>There</i> is his home; <i>there</i> lies his business,
      which a Noah’s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the
      millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie;
      he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the
      Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at
      last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to
      an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and
      is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out
      of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under
      his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    </h2>
<p>
      It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
      anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business
      that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the
      Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots,
      whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in
      all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he
      called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that
      we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the
      directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our
      starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then
      keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to
      the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the
      place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first,
      especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our
      first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas
      I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by
      dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a
      peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something
      which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
<p>
      Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,
      swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old
      doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so
      that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was
      over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help
      staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my
      neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, <i>two</i> of them, one for
      Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper
      upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the
      whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots
      too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
<p>
      I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with
      yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a
      dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and
      carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
<p>
      “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”
     </p>
<p>
      And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs.
      Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known
      our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further
      scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at
      a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned
      round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
     </p>
<p>
      “What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
<p>
      “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is <i>that</i> what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says
      I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time,
      ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
     </p>
<p>
      But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt,
      who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the
      word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the
      kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us
      both on one clam?”
     </p>
<p>
      However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
      apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
      came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
      hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
      hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into
      little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned
      with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage,
      and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him,
      and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great
      expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s
      clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.
      Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great
      emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came
      forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine
      cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
<p>
      We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to
      myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s that
      stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain’t
      that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”
     </p>
<p>
      Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its
      name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
      breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began
      to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the
      house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of
      codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior
      old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could
      not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along
      the beach among some fishermen’s boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding
      on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s
      decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    </p>
<p>
      Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
      concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede
      me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his
      harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every
      true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it’s
      dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort’nt
      v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three
      barrels of <i>ile</i>, was found dead in my first floor back, with his
      harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich
      dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had
      learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you
      till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
      variety.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    </h2>
<p>
      In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no
      small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
      diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and
      Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
      everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
      harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo
      earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with
      me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had
      already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael,
      should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned
      out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the
      present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
<p>
      I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
      confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of
      things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort
      of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did
      not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of
      our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon
      Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and
      our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon
      Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set
      about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor,
      that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning
      early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for
      it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting,
      humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; <i>how</i> it was I
      never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I
      never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving
      Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at
      his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After
      much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there
      were three ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the
      Tit-bit, and the Pequod. <i>Devil-Dam</i>, I do not know the origin of; <i>Tit-bit</i>
      is obvious; <i>Pequod</i>, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a
      celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient
      Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to
      the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for
      a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
<p>
      You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed
      luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not;
      but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same
      rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if
      anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned
      and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old
      hull’s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier’s, who has alike
      fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut
      somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
      overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of
      the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled,
      like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where
      Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and
      marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than
      half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her
      chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a
      retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this
      old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her
      original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of
      material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s
      carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian
      emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing
      of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
      bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
      garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm
      whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons
      to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly
      travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her
      reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one
      mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary
      foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the
      Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble
      craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with
      that.
    </p>
<p>
      Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,
      in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw
      nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather
      wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary
      erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high;
      consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the
      middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their
      broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually
      sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where
      the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old
      Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows
      of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
<p>
      And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
      his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the
      ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
      command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over
      with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout
      interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
<p>
      There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the
      elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and
      heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there
      was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles
      interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual
      sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for
      this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such
      eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
<p>
      “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the
      tent.
    </p>
<p>
      “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?”
       he demanded.
    </p>
<p>
      “I was thinking of shipping.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a
      stove boat?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, Sir, I never have.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    </p>
<p>
      “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been several
      voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I’ll
      take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant
      service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel
      considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes!
      man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little
      suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst
      not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering
      the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
     </p>
<p>
      I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of
      these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish
      Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of
      all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
<p>
      “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
      shipping ye.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,
      young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
      out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
      are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to
      know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of
      finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye
      on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
      up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah,
      ah!”
     </p>
<p>
      I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the
      hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could,
      “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was
      any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have
      inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou dost
      not talk shark a bit. <i>Sure</i>, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the
      merchant—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don’t
      aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each other. I
      have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for
      it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I do, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale’s
      throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be
      got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out
      by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the
      world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step
      forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me
      and tell me what ye see there.”
     </p>
<p>
      For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing
      exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
      concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me
      on the errand.
    </p>
<p>
      Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship
      swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing
      towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly
      monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon
      though, and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
      round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where
      you stand?”
     </p>
<p>
      I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
      Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all
      this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his
      willingness to ship me.
    </p>
<p>
      “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come
      along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
<p>
      Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising
      figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg
      was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is
      sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old
      annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning
      about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in
      the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the
      same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good
      interest.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker,
      the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day
      its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities
      of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things
      altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the
      most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting
      Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
<p>
      So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture
      names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in
      childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
      Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure
      of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown
      peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a
      Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things
      unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain
      and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many
      long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations
      never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and
      independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or savage impressions fresh
      from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly,
      but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous
      lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation’s census—a
      mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all
      detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other
      circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at
      the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through
      a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal
      greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one,
      but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only
      results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual
      circumstances.
    </p>
<p>
      Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But
      unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called
      serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
      veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally
      educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all
      his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island
      creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born
      Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.
      Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
      consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from
      conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
      had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe
      to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns
      upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his
      days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do
      not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he
      had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man’s
      religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world
      pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the
      drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from
      that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship
      owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by
      wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and
      dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned
      income.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
      incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
      task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
      curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,
      upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore
      exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was
      certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,
      though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity
      of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate,
      to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel
      completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a
      marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind
      what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the
      exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he
      carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,
      economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
<p>
      Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
      followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
      was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and
      never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed
      beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned
      up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from
      a ponderous volume.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
      studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain
      knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
     </p>
<p>
      As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,
      without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing
      me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
<p>
      “He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
<p>
      “I <i>dost</i>,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
<p>
      “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    </p>
<p>
      “He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his
      book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
<p>
      I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his
      friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only
      looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth
      the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at
      a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at
      what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already
      aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands,
      including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called <i>lays</i>,
      and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance
      pertaining to the respective duties of the ship’s company. I was also
      aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very
      large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship,
      splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I
      should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of
      the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually
      amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather <i>long lay</i>,
      yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty
      nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my
      three years’ beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
<p>
      It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
      fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
      that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
      world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim
      sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay
      would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I
      been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
<p>
      But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
      receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
      something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
      how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the
      other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole
      management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what
      the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping
      hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home
      there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now
      while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old
      Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an
      interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on
      mumbling to himself out of his book, “<i>Lay</i> not up for yourselves treasures
      upon earth, where moth—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay shall
      we give this young man?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust
      do corrupt, but <i>lay</i>—’”
     </p>
<p>
<i>Lay</i>, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
      shall not <i>lay</i> up many <i>lays</i> here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It
      was an exceedingly <i>long lay</i> that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of
      the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest
      consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a
      pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a <i>teenth</i> of it, you will
      then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a
      farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold
      doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to
      swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting
      his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is,
      there will your heart be also.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye
      hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
     </p>
<p>
      Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain
      Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou
      owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of
      them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young
      man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The
      seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.
      “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters,
      I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough
      to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten
      inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art still an
      impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a
      leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit,
      Captain Peleg.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
      insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he’s
      bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start
      my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat
      with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
      drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
     </p>
<p>
      As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous
      oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
<p>
      Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
      responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
      idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
      commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I
      made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath
      of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very
      quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He
      seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after
      letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he,
      too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still
      nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall’s gone
      off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a
      lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.
      That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael’s thy name,
      didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three
      hundredth lay.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall
      I bring him down to-morrow?”
     </p>
<p>
      “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
      which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled
      it any?” turning to me.
    </p>
<p>
      “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, bring him along then.”
     </p>
<p>
      And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had
      done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship
      that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
<p>
      But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain
      with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many
      cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her
      crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take
      command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore
      intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family,
      or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself
      much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is
      ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before
      irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted
      Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    </p>
<p>
      “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou art
      shipped.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know exactly
      what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of
      sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t sick; but no, he isn’t
      well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always see me, so I don’t
      suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but
      a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He’s a
      grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn’t speak much; but, when
      he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s
      above the common; Ahab’s been in colleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals;
      been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in
      mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the
      surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he
      ain’t Captain Peleg; <i>he’s Ahab</i>, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a
      crowned king!”
     </p>
<p>
      “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they
      not lick his blood?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance
      in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board
      the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
      ’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when
      he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead,
      said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other
      fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It’s a lie. I
      know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know
      what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but
      a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a good deal
      more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know
      that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but
      it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
      about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg
      last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a kind of moody—desperate
      moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all,
      let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it’s better to sail with a
      moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and
      wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides,
      my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet,
      resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child:
      hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my
      lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
     </p>
<p>
      As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally
      revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of
      painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy
      and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what, unless it was the cruel
      loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort
      of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know
      what it was. But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him;
      though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so
      imperfectly as he was known to me then. However, my thoughts were at
      length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab
      slipped my mind.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.
    </h2>
<p>
      As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
      day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
      cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,
      never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
      even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
      creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism
      quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a
      deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions
      yet owned and rented in his name.
    </p>
<p>
      I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
      things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
      pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
      subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd
      notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg
      thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and
      there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be,
      I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans
      alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
      sadly need mending.
    </p>
<p>
      Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals
      must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no
      answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. “Queequeg,” said I
      softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say, Queequeg! why don’t
      you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still as before. I
      began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he
      might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the
      door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but
      a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the
      bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold
      resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the
      landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to
      the chamber. That’s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon
      stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he
      must be inside here, and no possible mistake.
    </p>
<p>
      “Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.
      Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
      Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I
      met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must
      be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
      locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever
      since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
      baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
      Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the
      kitchen, I following.
    </p>
<p>
      Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
      vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of
      attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.
    </p>
<p>
      “Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch
      something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a
      stroke; depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing
      up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot
      and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
    </p>
<p>
      “What’s the matter with you, young man?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it
      open!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so
      as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying open
      any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the
      matter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”
     </p>
<p>
      In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the
      whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her
      nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
      seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the
      landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
      Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s
      unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God
      pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor
      lad a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the
      Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides
      permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill
      both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that
      noise there? You, young man, avast there!”
     </p>
<p>
      And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open
      the door.
    </p>
<p>
      “I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,
      there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her hand in her
      side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s see.” And with
      that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s supplemental bolt
      remained unwithdrawn within.
    </p>
<p>
      “Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a little,
      for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should
      not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily
      rush dashed myself full against the mark.
    </p>
<p>
      With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against
      the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there
      sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of
      the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He
      looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with
      scarce a sign of active life.
    </p>
<p>
      “Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with
      you?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.
    </p>
<p>
      But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like
      pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
      intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
      especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
      eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s <i>alive</i> at all events; so leave us, if you
      please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”
     </p>
<p>
      Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg
      to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do—for
      all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg, nor
      say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the
      slightest way.
    </p>
<p>
      I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
      they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes,
      it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll get up
      sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God, and his
      Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very punctual
      then.
    </p>
<p>
      I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
      stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as
      they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,
      confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after
      listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I went up
      stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must
      certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was
      just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow
      vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting
      there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a
      piece of wood on his head.
    </p>
<p>
      “For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
      some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But not a
      word did he reply.
    </p>
<p>
      Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and
      no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
      turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it
      promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary
      round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the
      faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of
      Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy
      position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.
      Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan
      on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
    </p>
<p>
      But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
      day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had
      been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun
      entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a
      cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again
      against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion, be
      it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other
      person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when a man’s
      religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him;
      and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in;
      then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the
      point with him.
    </p>
<p>
      And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed
      now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise
      and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
      religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
      Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in
      cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for
      the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common
      sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely
      sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see
      him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.
      Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves
      in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This
      is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy
      notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather
      digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling;
      and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by
      Ramadans.
    </p>
<p>
      I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;
      expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no;
      only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his
      father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the
      enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the afternoon, and all
      cooked and eaten that very evening.
    </p>
<p>
      “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
      inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had
      visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a
      great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard
      or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great
      wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and
      cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the
      victor’s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents
      were so many Christmas turkeys.
    </p>
<p>
      After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
      impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed
      dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own
      point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third
      understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt
      thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He
      looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as
      though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be
      so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.
    </p>
<p>
      At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
      breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make
      much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod,
      sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 18. His Mark.
    </h2>
<p>
      As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
      carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
      from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and
      furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
      unless they previously produced their papers.
    </p>
<p>
      “What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the
      bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
    </p>
<p>
      “I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
      behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted. Son
      of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present in
      communion with any Christian church?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here be
      it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last
      come to be converted into the churches.
    </p>
<p>
      “First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in
      Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his
      spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and
      putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning
      stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.
    </p>
<p>
      “How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not very
      long, I rather guess, young man.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it would
      have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of
      Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it
      every Lord’s day.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said I;
      “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
      Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain
      thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
     </p>
<p>
      Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same ancient
      Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg
      here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us belong; the
      great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world;
      we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no
      ways touching the grand belief; in <i>that</i> we all join hands.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Splice, thou mean’st <i>splice</i> hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer. “Young
      man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I
      never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father Mapple
      himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come aboard, come
      aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there—what’s
      that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a
      harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it
      about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
      in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”
     </p>
<p>
      Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the
      bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to
      the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried
      out in some such way as this:—
    </p>
<p>
      “Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
      spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he darted
      the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the ship’s
      decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e
      eye; why, dad whale dead.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
      vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.
      “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must have
      Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we’ll
      give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was given a
      harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
     </p>
<p>
      So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
      enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
    </p>
<p>
      When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
      signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know how
      to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or
      make thy mark?”
     </p>
<p>
      But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part
      in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen,
      copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a
      queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through
      Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood
      something like this:—
    </p>
<p>
      Quohog. his X mark.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
      and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
      broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
      entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in
      Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
      looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do my
      duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the
      souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I
      sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn
      the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind
      thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”
     </p>
<p>
      Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,
      heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
    </p>
<p>
      “Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”
       cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish.
      There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all
      Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good.
      He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered
      away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went
      to Davy Jones.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as
      I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is
      to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly
      guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod
      here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same
      voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of
      Death and the Judgment then?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
      thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.
      Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and
      the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting
      thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.
      Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death
      then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save
      all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest
      port; that was what I was thinking of.”
     </p>
<p>
      Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we
      followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who
      were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a
      patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been
      wasted.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.
    </h2>
<p>
      “Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”
     </p>
<p>
      Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the
      water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above
      words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his
      massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily
      apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black
      handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
      directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed
      bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.
    </p>
<p>
      “Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      “You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little
      more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole
      arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
      bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Anything down there about your souls?”
     </p>
<p>
      “About what?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though, I
      know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are
      all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.
    </p>
<p>
      “<i>He’s</i> got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in
      other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon
      the word <i>he</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      “Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from
      somewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old
      Thunder yet, have ye?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of
      his manner.
    </p>
<p>
      “Captain Ahab.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav’n’t
      seen him yet, have ye?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
      all right again before long.”
     </p>
<p>
      “All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
      derisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
      this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What do you know about him?”
     </p>
<p>
      “What did they <i>tell</i> you about him? Say that!”
     </p>
<p>
      “They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s a
      good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump
      when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word
      with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off
      Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
      nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in
      Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
      calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,
      according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them matters and
      something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it?
      Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve heard tell about
      the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh
      yes, <i>that</i> every one knows a’most—I mean they know he’s only one leg;
      and that a parmacetti took the other off.”
     </p>
<p>
      “My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don’t
      know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little
      damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship
      there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of
      his leg.”
     </p>
<p>
      “<i>All</i> about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pretty sure.”
     </p>
<p>
      With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
      stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
      little, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the
      papers? Well, well, what’s signed, is signed; and what’s to be, will be;
      and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow, it’s all fixed and
      arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose;
      as well these as any other men, God pity ’em! Morning to ye, shipmates,
      morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped ye.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell us,
      out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken
      in your game; that’s all I have to say.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you
      are just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
      morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one of
      ’em.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us.
      It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
      great secret in him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy
      man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Elijah.”
     </p>
<p>
      Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other’s
      fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a
      humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a
      hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did
      so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.
      Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of
      his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether
      the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it
      seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for
      the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,
      half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all
      kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with
      the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn
      fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when
      I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig;
      and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
      things.
    </p>
<p>
      I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
      dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and
      on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without
      seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it
      seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 20. All Astir.
    </h2>
<p>
      A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not
      only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board,
      and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened
      that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg
      seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
      look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at
      the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
      working till long after night-fall.
    </p>
<p>
      On the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at
      all the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests
      must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
      vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving,
      however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very
      long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days.
      But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling
      how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped.
    </p>
<p>
      Every one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives
      and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
      indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which
      necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all
      grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also
      holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as
      with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the
      numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the
      impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented,
      it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most
      exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and
      loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
      Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and
      spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
    </p>
<p>
      At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
      Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel,
      and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was
      a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of
      things, both large and small.
    </p>
<p>
      Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad’s
      sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but
      withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if <i>she</i> could help it,
      nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting
      to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the
      steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate’s
      desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the
      small of some one’s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her
      name, which was Charity—Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And
      like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about
      hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that
      promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship
      in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she
      herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.
    </p>
<p>
      But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
      board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a
      still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
      Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a
      long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went
      his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg
      came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the
      hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded
      by roaring back into his wigwam.
    </p>
<p>
      During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft,
      and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was
      going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer,
      that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day;
      meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything
      necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest
      with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but
      half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once
      laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so
      soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any
      wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter,
      he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And
      much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly
      sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.
    </h2>
<p>
      It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
      drew nigh the wharf.
    </p>
<p>
      “There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to
      Queequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind
      us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself
      between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,
      strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.
    </p>
<p>
      “Going aboard?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Hands off, will you,” said I.
    </p>
<p>
      “Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ain’t going aboard, then?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you know,
      Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly
      looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.
    </p>
<p>
      “Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are
      going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
      detained.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”
     </p>
<p>
      “He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
      paces.
    </p>
<p>
      “Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”
     </p>
<p>
      But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
      shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards
      that ship a while ago?”
     </p>
<p>
      Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes, I
      thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”
     </p>
<p>
      Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
      touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will ye?
    </p>
<p>
      “Find who?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I was
      going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all
      one, all in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it?
      Good-bye to ye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before
      the Grand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving
      me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.
    </p>
<p>
      At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
      quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
      hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to
      the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we
      went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered
      pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face
      downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept
      upon him.
    </p>
<p>
      “Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,
      looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,
      Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have
      thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not
      for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down;
      and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps
      we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself
      accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear, as though feeling if
      it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.
    </p>
<p>
      “Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him
      face.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then; but
      how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you are
      heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he’ll
      twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”
     </p>
<p>
      Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
      lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
      over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him
      in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land,
      owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs,
      and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some of the
      lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that
      respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them
      round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an
      excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into
      walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring
      him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some
      damp marshy place.
    </p>
<p>
      While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
      from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.
    </p>
<p>
      “What’s that for, Queequeg?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”
     </p>
<p>
      He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
      which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
      his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
      strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell
      upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled in
      the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his
      eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      “Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came
      aboard last night.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What Captain?—Ahab?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Who but him indeed?”
     </p>
<p>
      I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
      heard a noise on deck.
    </p>
<p>
      “Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,
      that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
      saying he went on deck, and we followed.
    </p>
<p>
      It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes;
      the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and
      several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on
      board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his
      cabin.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.
    </h2>
<p>
      At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s riggers,
      and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
      ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift—a
      night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare
      Bible for the steward—after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and
      Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
    </p>
<p>
      “Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all
      ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
      Well, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”
     </p>
<p>
      “No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said Bildad,
      “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”
     </p>
<p>
      How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
      Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
      quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well
      as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him
      was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the
      idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship
      under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at
      all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he was not yet completely
      recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.
      And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service
      many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after
      heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell
      merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good
      with the pilot.
    </p>
<p>
      But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg
      was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and
      not Bildad.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at the
      main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before,
      this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
      Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
      be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
    </p>
<p>
      “Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next
      command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.
    </p>
<p>
      Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is
      the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it
      known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots
      of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
      order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned
      in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might now be
      seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor,
      and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer
      the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about
      the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three
      days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed
      on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his
      sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and
      swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink
      the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my
      handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we
      both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was
      comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be
      found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay;
      when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was
      horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his
      leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first kick.
    </p>
<p>
      “Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared. “Spring,
      thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye spring, I
      say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
      whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
      say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved along
      the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
      imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain
      Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
    </p>
<p>
      At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a
      short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we
      found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray
      cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the
      bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of
      some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.
    </p>
<p>
      Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
      old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all
      over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes
      were heard,—
    </p>
<pre>
      <i>“Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
         Stand dressed in living green.
      So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
         While Jordan rolled between.”</i>
</pre>
<p>
      Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were
      full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the
      boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was
      yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and
      glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,
      untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
    </p>
<p>
      At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
      longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
      alongside.
    </p>
<p>
      It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at
      this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very
      loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage—beyond
      both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned
      dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain;
      a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors
      of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful
      of every interest to him,—poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the
      deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another
      farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked
      towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen
      Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right
      and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling
      a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and
      holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as
      much as to say, “Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”
     </p>
<p>
      As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his
      philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came
      too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now a
      word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
    </p>
<p>
      But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
      him,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the
      main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!
      Careful, careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye,
      Starbuck—luck to ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye
      and good luck to ye all—and this day three years I’ll have a hot
      supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”
     </p>
<p>
      “God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old Bildad,
      almost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so that Captain
      Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he needs, and
      ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the
      hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good
      white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the year. Don’t
      forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don’t waste
      the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker! Don’t
      whale it too much a’ Lord’s days, men; but don’t miss a fair chance
      either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses
      tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the
      islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don’t keep
      that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it’ll spoil. Be
      careful with the butter—twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye,
      if—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with that,
      Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
    </p>
<p>
      Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
      screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three
      heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
      Atlantic.

      CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.
    </h2>
<p>
      Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
      mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
    </p>
<p>
      When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
      bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm
      but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the
      man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous voyage,
      could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.
      The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the
      unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is
      the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him
      as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward
      land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is
      safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s
      kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that
      ship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
      though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.
      With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights
      ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the
      lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly rushing into
      peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
    </p>
<p>
      Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
      intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
      effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
      wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous,
      slavish shore?
    </p>
<p>
      But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite
      as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be
      ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like,
      then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all
      this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee
      grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing—straight
      up, leaps thy apotheosis!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.
    </h2>
<p>
      As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and
      as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen
      as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all
      anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us
      hunters of whales.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the
      fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted
      on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger
      were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but
      slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to
      the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval
      officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his
      visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming
      and ridiculous.
    </p>
<p>
      Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen,
      is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering
      sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we are
      surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true.
      But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all
      Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as
      for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon
      be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and
      which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at
      least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting
      the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a
      whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
      battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies’
      plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of
      the soldier’s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has
      freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of
      the sperm whale’s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.
      For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the
      interlinked terrors and wonders of God!
    </p>
<p>
      But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly
      pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost
      all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as
      before so many shrines, to our glory!
    </p>
<p>
      But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales;
      see what we whalemen are, and have been.
    </p>
<p>
      Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling fleets?
      Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling
      ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of
      families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the
      years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of £1,000,000?
      And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the
      rest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven
      hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming
      4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing,
      $20,000,000! and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped
      harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not something
      puissant in whaling?
    </p>
<p>
      But this is not the half; look again.
    </p>
<p>
      I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
      point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years
      has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one
      aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and
      another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
      continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well
      be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
      pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue
      all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past the
      whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least
      known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which
      had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and
      European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them
      fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which originally
      showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.
      They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your
      Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have
      sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cook
      and your Krusenstern. For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in
      the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin
      islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his
      marines and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such
      a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
      life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which
      Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of
      being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!
    </p>
<p>
      Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
      scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and
      the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It
      was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish
      crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be
      distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation
      of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the
      establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
    </p>
<p>
      That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given
      to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born
      discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as
      pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship
      is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of
      the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved
      from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily
      dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia
      confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that
      cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases
      carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that
      double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the
      whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the
      threshold.
    </p>
<p>
      But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
      æsthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to
      shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
      every time.
    </p>
<p>
      The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will
      say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?</i> Who wrote
      the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed
      the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than
      Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from
      Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our
      glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!
    </p>
<p>
      True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
      good blood in their veins.
    </p>
<p>
<i>No good blood in their veins?</i> They have something better than royal blood
      there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards,
      by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the
      ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers—all kith and
      kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the barbed iron from one side
      of the world to the other.
    </p>
<p>
      Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.
    </p>
<p>
<i>Whaling not respectable?</i> Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory
      law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand
      imposing way.
    </p>
<p>
<i>The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?</i> In one of the mighty
      triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s capital,
      the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the
      most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
    </p>
<p>
      *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
    </p>
<p>
      Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
      dignity in whaling.
    </p>
<p>
<i>No dignity in whaling?</i> The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest.
      Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your hat in
      presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man
      that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account
      that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted
      of taking as many walled towns.
    </p>
<p>
      And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered
      prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
      but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if
      hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather
      have done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more
      properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I
      prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling; for a
      whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.

      CHAPTER 25. Postscript.
    </h2>
<p>
      In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
      substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
      should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
      eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he not be
      blameworthy?
    </p>
<p>
      It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern
      ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is
      gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be
      a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely—who knows?
      Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is solemnly oiled at his
      coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint
      it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery?
      Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this
      regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and
      contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that
      anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally,
      that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general
      rule, he can’t amount to much in his totality.
    </p>
<p>
      But the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil
      is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
      oil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
      What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
      unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
    </p>
<p>
      Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens
      with coronation stuff!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.
    </h2>
<p>
      The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
      Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
      coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard
      as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would
      not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general
      drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is
      famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried
      up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak,
      seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed
      the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the
      man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight
      skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with
      inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck
      seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as
      now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his
      interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into
      his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those
      thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid,
      steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of
      action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety
      and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times
      affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.
      Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural
      reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly
      incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in
      some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
      from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if
      at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his
      far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend
      him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him
      still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted
      men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in
      the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I will have no man in my
      boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a whale.” By this, he seemed
      to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which
      arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an
      utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as careful a
      man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall ere long see
      what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or
      almost any other whale hunter.
    </p>
<p>
      Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;
      but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally
      practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business
      of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like
      her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had
      no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in
      fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought
      Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living,
      and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been
      so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father’s? Where, in
      the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?
    </p>
<p>
      With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
      superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
      could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it
      was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
      terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that
      these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him, which,
      under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and
      burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of
      bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally
      abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the
      ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more
      terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from
      the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.
    </p>
<p>
      But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
      abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to
      write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the
      fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
      stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
      men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and
      so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious
      blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.
      That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that
      it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with
      keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can
      piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings
      against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not
      the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no
      robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick
      or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates
      without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and
      circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!
    </p>
<p>
      If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
      hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
      graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them
      all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch
      that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow
      over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me
      out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal
      mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great
      democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the
      pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of
      finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst
      pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a
      war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all
      Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from
      the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.
    </h2>
<p>
      Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
      according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
      neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent
      air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling
      away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year.
      Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as if
      the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited
      guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part
      of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When
      close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his
      unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.
      He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the
      most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the
      jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there
      is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
      but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable
      dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of
      the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something
      which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.
    </p>
<p>
      What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing
      man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of
      grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to
      bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have
      been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of
      the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected
      him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept
      a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy
      reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in
      succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then
      loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed,
      instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into
      his mouth.
    </p>
<p>
      I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
      peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
      ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the
      numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the
      cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
      mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco
      smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.
    </p>
<p>
      The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A
      short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who
      somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and
      hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor
      with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to
      all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and
      mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible
      danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous
      whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat,
      requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time
      and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious
      fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he
      followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years’ voyage round
      Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a
      carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind
      may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made
      to clinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the
      Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square
      timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of
      many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship
      against the icy concussions of those battering seas.
    </p>
<p>
      Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
      men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
      Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain
      Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these
      three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their
      long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as
      the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
    </p>
<p>
      And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
      Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
      who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
      former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
      moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
      and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set down
      who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them
      belonged.
    </p>
<p>
      First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for
      his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
    </p>
<p>
      Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
      promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant
      of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of
      Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they
      usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean,
      sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes—for an
      Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering
      expression—all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the
      unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the
      great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests
      of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
      woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;
      the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of
      the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would
      almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans,
      and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers
      of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire.
    </p>
<p>
      Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
      negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold.
      Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors
      called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards
      to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
      lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere
      in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most
      frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of
      the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of
      men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a
      giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his
      socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white
      man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a
      fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the
      Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the
      residue of the Pequod’s company, be it said, that at the present day not
      one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the
      American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the
      officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as
      with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the
      engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and
      Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American
      liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously
      supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to
      the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
      augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like
      manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the
      Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the
      passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no
      telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly
      all Islanders in the Pequod, <i>Isolatoes</i> too, I call such, not acknowledging
      the common continent of men, but each <i>Isolato</i> living on a separate
      continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these
      Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the
      sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to
      lay the world’s grievances before that bar from which not very many of
      them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he never did—oh, no! he
      went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall
      ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time,
      when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in
      with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,
      hailed a hero there!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 28. Ahab.
    </h2>
<p>
      For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen
      of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
      and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
      only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin
      with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but
      commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there,
      though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now
      sacred retreat of the cabin.
    </p>
<p>
      Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed
      aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
      disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea,
      became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by
      the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,
      with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly
      could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile
      at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.
      But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness—to call it so—which
      I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed
      against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the
      harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,
      heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies
      which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I
      ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the fierce uniqueness
      of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so
      abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief
      officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to
      allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness
      in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers
      and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and
      they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape
      man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a
      space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from
      it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
      sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
      weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and
      gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship
      was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and
      melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the
      forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,
      foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab
      stood upon his quarter-deck.
    </p>
<p>
      There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
      recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the
      fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or
      taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole
      high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
      unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from
      among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny
      scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a
      slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular
      seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the
      upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single
      twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off
      into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether
      that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some
      desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent,
      throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by
      the mates. But once Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the
      crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old
      did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
      fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild
      hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an
      old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had
      never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old
      sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old
      Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor
      seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should
      be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to pass, so he
      muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,
      would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
    </p>
<p>
      So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid
      brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted
      that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
      white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that
      this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the
      sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said the old
      Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
      mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”
     </p>
<p>
      I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
      the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there
      was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His
      bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud;
      Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship’s
      ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a
      determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,
      forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his
      officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and
      expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness
      of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody
      stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the
      nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.
    </p>
<p>
      Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But
      after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing
      in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily
      walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a
      little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the
      ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the
      sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that
      he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said,
      or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary
      there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not
      regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision
      the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing,
      out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for
      that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his
      brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves
      upon.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,
      holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.
      For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to
      the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most
      thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to
      welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little
      respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did
      he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would
      have soon flowered out in a smile.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
    </h2>
<p>
      Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
      rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually
      reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly
      cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as
      crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up—flaked up, with
      rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
      jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
      absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, ’twas
      hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all
      the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and
      potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul,
      especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her
      crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these
      subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.
    </p>
<p>
      Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
      man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the
      old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked
      deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to
      live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the
      cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels like going down into
      one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an old captain
      like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug
      berth.”
     </p>
<p>
      So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
      set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and
      when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it
      not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its
      place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of
      steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman
      would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge,
      gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering
      touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually
      abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
      seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been
      the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would
      have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him
      too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was
      measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,
      came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,
      hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one
      could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
      insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
      then.
    </p>
<p>
      “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
      fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where
      such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.—Down,
      dog, and kennel!”
     </p>
<p>
      Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
      scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, “I
      am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like
      it, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as
      if to avoid some passionate temptation.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be called a
      dog, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or
      I’ll clear the world of thee!”
     </p>
<p>
      As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
      his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
    </p>
<p>
      “I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,” muttered
      Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s very queer.
      Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go back and strike
      him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for him?
      Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time
      I ever <i>did</i> pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him
      fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How
      he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway
      there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a
      deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours
      out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’t that Dough-Boy,
      the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man’s
      hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,
      and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of
      frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I
      guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it’s a kind of
      Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don’t
      know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He’s full of
      riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as
      Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s that for, I should like to know?
      Who’s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But
      there’s no telling, it’s the old game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn
      me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be born into the world, if only to fall
      right asleep. And now that I think of it, that’s about the first thing
      babies do, and that’s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are
      queer, come to think of ’em. But that’s against my principles. Think not,
      is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So
      here goes again. But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he
      called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of <i>that!</i>
      He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he <i>did</i> kick me,
      and I didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.
      It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I
      don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of
      turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though—How?
      how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to hammock
      again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over
      by daylight.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.
    </h2>
<p>
      When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;
      and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the
      watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting
      the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side
      of the deck, he sat and smoked.
    </p>
<p>
      In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
      fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one
      look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him
      of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the
      sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in
      quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How now,”
       he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no longer
      soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here
      have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
      ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such
      nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the
      strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?
      This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors
      among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I’ll
      smoke no more—”
     </p>
<p>
      He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
      waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.
      With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
    </h2>
<p>
      Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
    </p>
<p>
      “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory
      leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,
      upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!
      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But
      what was still more curious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams
      are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be
      thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
      kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not a real leg,
      only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between a living thump
      and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty
      times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member—that
      makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the
      while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed
      pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I
      say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a
      whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in
      fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Besides,’
      thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what
      a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
      <i>there’s</i> a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a
      point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I
      was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,
      with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.
      ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a
      phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’
      says I at last. ‘And what business is that of yours, I should like to
      know, Mr. Humpback? Do <i>you</i> want a kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no
      sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and
      dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think, I
      saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of
      marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I
      won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’ said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept
      muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney
      hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise
      Stubb,’ I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I
      had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that
      kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I, ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye
      here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t
      he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right <i>here</i> it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he
      used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says
      he, ‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right
      good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,
      you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.
      It’s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old
      England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,
      and made garter-knights of; but, be <i>your</i> boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked
      by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; <i>be</i> kicked by
      him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can’t
      help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’ With that, he all
      of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the
      air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do
      you think of that dream, Flask?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”
     </p>
<p>
      “May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
      standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you
      can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever
      he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
    </p>
<p>
      “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
    </p>
<p>
      “What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of
      something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?
      Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,
      Flask. Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this
      way.”

      “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
      Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
    </p>
<p>
      “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as
      to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * *
      Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal” (sperm whale),
      says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
    </p>
<p>
      “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”
       “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field strewn
      with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us
      naturalists.”
     </p>
<p>
      Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
      those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
      knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some
      small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men,
      small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in
      little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the
      Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray;
      Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
      Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;
      John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of
      Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate
      generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will
      show.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever
      saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer
      and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the
      Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby
      knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with
      which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it
      said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.
      He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the
      long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some
      seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown
      sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all
      but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been
      every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in
      the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,
      without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has
      at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good
      people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm
      whale now reigneth!
    </p>
<p>
      There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
      sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
      succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s; both in
      their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and
      reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in
      their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of
      excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As
      yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in
      any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten
      life.
    </p>
<p>
      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive
      classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to
      be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man
      advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor
      endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to
      be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not
      pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or—in
      this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is
      simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the
      architect, not the builder.
    </p>
<p>
      But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office
      is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to
      have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis
      of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to
      hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well
      appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the
      hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through
      oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in
      earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.
    </p>
<p>
      First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is
      in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still
      remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature,
      A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from the
      fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks
      and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict, were
      still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.
    </p>
<p>
      The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from
      the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular
      heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
      intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure
      meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
      Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they
      united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
      insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
    </p>
<p>
      Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
      ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This
      fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect
      does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given you those
      items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all
      other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
    </p>
<p>
      Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
      conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
      whale is <i>a spouting fish with a horizontal tail</i>. There you have him.
      However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.
      A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because
      he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more
      cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that
      all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or
      up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be
      similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.
    </p>
<p>
      By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from
      the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the
      whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with
      it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the
      smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this
      ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire
      whale host.
    </p>
<p>
      *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
      Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included
      by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,
      contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on
      wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as
      whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom
      of Cetology.
    </p>
<p>
      First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS
      (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both
      small and large.
    </p>
<p>
      I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
    </p>
<p>
      As the type of the FOLIO I present the <i>Sperm Whale</i>; of the OCTAVO, the
      <i>Grampus</i>; of the DUODECIMO, the <i>Porpoise</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The
      <i>Sperm Whale</i>; II. the <i>Right Whale</i>; III. the <i>Fin-Back Whale</i>; IV. the
      <i>Hump-backed Whale</i>; V. the <i>Razor Back Whale</i>; VI. the <i>Sulphur Bottom Whale</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER I. (<i>Sperm Whale</i>).—This whale, among the
      English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale,
      and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the
      Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is,
      without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of
      all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far
      the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that
      valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will,
      in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I
      now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries
      ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper
      individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the
      stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly
      supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known
      in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that
      this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale
      which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,
      also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but
      only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the
      druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in
      the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its
      original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its
      value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the
      appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from
      which this spermaceti was really derived.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Right Whale</i>).—In one respect this is
      the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted
      by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and
      the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article in commerce.
      Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the
      following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the
      Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity
      concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What
      then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It
      is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of
      the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the
      Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two
      centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic
      seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in
      the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various
      other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
    </p>
<p>
      Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
      English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in
      all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
      determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
      endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
      some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The
      right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to
      elucidating the sperm whale.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Fin-Back</i>).—Under this head I reckon a
      monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in
      his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips
      present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds
      of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which
      he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three
      or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of
      an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the
      slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,
      at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is
      moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this
      gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it
      may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat
      resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that
      Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He
      seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going
      solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most
      sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall
      misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power
      and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this
      leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing
      for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his
      mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a
      theoretic species denominated <i>Whalebone whales</i>, that is, whales with
      baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be
      several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed
      whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.
    </p>
<p>
      In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of great
      importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient
      in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to
      attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his
      baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts
      or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a
      regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions,
      which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump,
      back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
      indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard
      to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential
      particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a
      hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale
      and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the
      similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above
      mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular
      combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an
      irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed
      upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has
      split.
    </p>
<p>
      But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale,
      in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right
      classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland
      whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by
      his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And
      if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you
      will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the
      systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains?
      nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal
      volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical
      system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for
      it alone is practicable. To proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>) CHAPTER IV. (<i>Hump Back</i>).—This whale is often seen on
      the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and
      towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might
      call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for
      him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has
      a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen.
      He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more
      gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER V. (<i>Razor Back</i>).—Of this whale little is
      known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
      retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
      coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises
      in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does
      anybody else.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), CHAPTER VI. (<i>Sulphur Bottom</i>).—Another retiring
      gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
      Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at
      least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then
      always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never
      chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of
      him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor
      can the oldest Nantucketer.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus ends BOOK I. (<i>Folio</i>), and now begins BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>).
    </p>
<p>
      OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among
      which present may be numbered:—I., the <i>Grampus</i>; II., the <i>Black Fish</i>;
      III., the <i>Narwhale</i>; IV., the <i>Thrasher</i>; V., the <i>Killer</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
      Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the
      former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in
      figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does
      not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER I. (<i>Grampus</i>).—Though this fish, whose
      loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
      landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly
      classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of
      the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of
      moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length,
      and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is
      never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and
      pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as
      premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Black Fish</i>).—I give the popular
      fishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
      Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
      suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because
      blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena
      Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
      circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
      carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
      averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
      all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in
      swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
      profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena
      whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as
      some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
      themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their
      blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of
      thirty gallons of oil.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Narwhale</i>), that is, <i>Nostril whale</i>.—Another
      instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar
      horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some
      sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some
      exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn
      is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little
      depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side,
      which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the
      aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn
      or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used
      like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell
      me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of
      the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for
      the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it
      sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you
      cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,
      that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however
      that may be—it would certainly be very convenient to him for a
      folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked
      whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious
      example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated
      nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
      sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It
      was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way
      that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
      Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black
      Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,
      when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
      of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; “when Sir
      Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black Letter, “on bended knees he
      presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which
      for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.” An Irish author
      avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to
      her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn
      nature.
    </p>
<p>
      The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
      milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His
      oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is
      seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER IV. (<i>Killer</i>).—Of this whale little is
      precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
      naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that
      he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of
      Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
      hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The
      Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception
      might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its
      indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and
      Sharks included.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), CHAPTER V. (<i>Thrasher</i>).—This gentleman is famous
      for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts
      the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging
      him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.
      Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws,
      even in the lawless seas.
    </p>
<p>
       Thus ends BOOK II. (<i>Octavo</i>), and begins BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>).
    </p>
<p>
      DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza
      Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.
    </p>
<p>
      To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
      possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
      feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular
      sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
      above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition
      of what a whale is—<i>i.e.</i> a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER 1. (<i>Huzza Porpoise</i>).—This is the
      common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
      bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
      must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims
      in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to
      heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally
      hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably
      come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always
      live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can
      withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help
      ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza
      Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and
      delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in
      request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones.
      Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you
      that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
      readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and
      you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER II. (<i>Algerine Porpoise</i>).—A pirate.
      Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat
      larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke
      him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but
      never yet saw him captured.
    </p>
<p>
      BOOK III. (<i>Duodecimo</i>), CHAPTER III. (<i>Mealy-mouthed Porpoise</i>).—The
      largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is
      known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is
      that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that
      he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in
      some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly
      girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no
      fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and
      sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all.
      Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a
      boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship’s hull, called the “bright
      waist,” that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate
      colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his
      head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just
      escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy
      aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.
    </p>
<p>
     * * * * * *
    </p>
<p>
      Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
      Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans
      of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous
      whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not
      personally. I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for
      possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may
      complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall
      hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into
      this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The
      Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape
      Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered
      Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue
      Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there
      might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner
      of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly
      help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying
      nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here,
      and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my
      word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even
      as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing
      upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished
      by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone
      to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book
      is but a draught—nay, but the draught of a draught. Oh, Time,
      Strength, Cash, and Patience!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
    </h2>
<p>
      Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as
      any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from
      the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of
      course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
    </p>
<p>
      The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by
      the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more
      ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now
      called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the
      Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time
      made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain’s
      authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the
      vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the
      Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland
      Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch
      official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At
      present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of
      the captain’s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good
      conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
      depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important
      officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a
      whaling ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the
      grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live
      apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as
      their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded
      as their social equal.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this—the
      first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen
      alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in
      most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part
      of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain’s cabin,
      and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.
    </p>
<p>
      Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of
      all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the
      community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or
      low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common
      luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;
      though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous
      discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an
      old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,
      live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the
      quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.
      Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
      parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any
      military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore
      the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
    </p>
<p>
      And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given
      to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever
      exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man
      to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and
      though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected
      with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,
      whether of condescension or <i>in terrorem</i>, or otherwise; yet even Captain
      Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the
      sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
      forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally
      making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
      legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,
      which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those
      forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
      dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what it will, it can
      never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without
      the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in
      themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps
      God’s true princes of the Empire from the world’s hustings; and leaves the
      highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous
      more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of
      the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead
      level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when
      extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances
      even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the
      case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire
      encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before
      the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
      depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever
      forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now
      alluded to.
    </p>
<p>
      But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness
      and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must
      not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him;
      and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied
      me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at
      from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied
      air!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.
    </h2>
<p>
      It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
      face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who,
      sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of
      the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,
      medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part
      of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would
      think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, catching
      hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,
      unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,” disappears into the
      cabin.
    </p>
<p>
      When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck, the
      first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck
      rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a
      grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,
      “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges
      about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see
      whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes
      up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner, Mr. Flask,” follows after his
      predecessors.
    </p>
<p>
      But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
      seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts
      of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he
      strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the
      Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up
      into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as
      he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by
      bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway
      below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent,
      hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence, in the character of
      Abjectus, or the Slave.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
      artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some
      officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly
      enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers
      the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander’s
      cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and
      humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is
      marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A problem?
      Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been
      Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have
      been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and
      intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited
      guests, that man’s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence
      for the time; that man’s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for
      Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has
      tasted what it is to be Cæsar. It is a witchery of social czarship which
      there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the
      official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive
      the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
    </p>
<p>
      Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on
      the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential
      cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were
      as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk
      the smallest social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all
      fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him.
      I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment
      with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the
      weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the
      slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards
      him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it
      tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the
      plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without
      circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the
      German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these
      cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at
      table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a
      relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the
      hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
      of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his
      would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help
      himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first
      degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would
      he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,
      strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the
      chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask
      presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the
      ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny
      complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
      marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him,
      a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!
    </p>
<p>
      Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is
      the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly jammed in
      point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they
      also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but
      a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon
      shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,
      he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy
      usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask
      once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of
      an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
      otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much
      relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction,
      thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer;
      but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the
      forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There’s the fruits of
      promotion now; there’s the vanity of glory: there’s the insanity of life!
      Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge
      against Flask in Flask’s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in
      order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a
      peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered
      before awful Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in
      the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order
      to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to
      some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers
      were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a
      sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and mighty cabin.
    </p>
<p>
      In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
      invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free
      license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
      the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the
      sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
      with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;
      they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.
      Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the
      vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain
      to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the
      solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a
      nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
      accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once
      Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy’s memory by
      snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden
      trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle
      preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering
      sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt
      baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the
      black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these
      three savages, Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver.
      Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they
      demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry
      adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door,
      till all was over.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his
      filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the
      floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low
      carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin
      framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.
      But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say
      dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small
      mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
      baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed
      strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his
      dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or
      by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,
      barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
      much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any
      marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
      Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
      picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
      round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the
      whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances
      and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would
      ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all
      tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his
      Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
      murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white
      waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm,
      but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three
      salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering
      ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish
      scimetars in scabbards.
    </p>
<p>
      But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
      there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
      scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
      when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
    </p>
<p>
      In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
      captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the
      ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
      anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the
      mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have
      lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was
      something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a moment,
      only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the
      open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no
      companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included
      in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the
      world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as
      when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying
      himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his
      own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in
      the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.
    </h2>
<p>
      It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
      other seamen my first mast-head came round.
    </p>
<p>
      In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously
      with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen
      thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.
      And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she is drawing nigh
      home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial even—then,
      her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles
      sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the
      hope of capturing one whale more.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
      ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take
      it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians;
      because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their
      progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have
      intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet
      (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may
      be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God’s wrath;
      therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the
      Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is
      an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists, that the
      first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly
      supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those
      edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those
      old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new
      stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a
      whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian
      hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and
      spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his
      food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance
      of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern
      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and
      bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still
      entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any
      strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of
      Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the
      air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,
      Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft
      on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars,
      his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
      will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his
      mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London
      smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick
      haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.
    </p>
<p>
      It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers
      of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is
      plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of
      Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early
      times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit
      of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the
      sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,
      something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same
      plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying
      the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this
      custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head,
      that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from
      sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the
      helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of
      the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy
      meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the
      silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic
      stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the
      hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of
      the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite
      series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
      into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
      uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
      with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary
      excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;
      fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have
      for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly
      stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
    </p>
<p>
      In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’ voyage,
      as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head
      would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that
      the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term
      of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching
      to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of
      feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a
      pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in
      which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch
      is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel
      sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t’ gallant cross-trees.
      Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he
      would standing on a bull’s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may
      carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but
      properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the
      unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and
      cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running
      great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps
      in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere
      envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest
      of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
      your watch-coat.
    </p>
<p>
      Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
      pulpits, called <i>crow’s-nests</i>, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler
      are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the
      fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the
      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this
      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
      <i>crow’s-nest</i> of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s good
      craft. He called it the <i>Sleet’s crow’s-nest</i>, in honor of himself; he
      being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous
      false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own
      names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise
      should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In
      shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;
      it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable
      side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed
      on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch
      in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a
      comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and
      coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,
      pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in
      person stood his mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he
      always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a
      powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,
      or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was
      plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
      little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he so enlarges
      upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account
      of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass he kept there
      for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
      the “local attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the
      horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s
      case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among
      her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific
      here, yet, for all his learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass
      observations,” and “approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain
      Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
      meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well
      replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his
      crow’s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I
      greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;
      yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that
      case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have
      been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the
      mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches
      of the pole.
    </p>
<p>
      But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain
      Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly
      counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive
      seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up
      the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with
      Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending
      a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take
      a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my
      ultimate destination.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but
      sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I—being
      left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude—how
      could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships’
      standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.”
     </p>
<p>
      And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
      Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
      lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
      offers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of
      such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be killed;
      and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the
      world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are these
      monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an
      asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men,
      disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar
      and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the
      mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase
      ejaculates:—
    </p>
<pre>
      “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!
      Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”
</pre>
<p>
      Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
      philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
      “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to
      all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather
      not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists
      have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what
      use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses
      at home.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
      cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet.
      Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.” Perhaps they
      were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon;
      but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious
      reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with
      thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at
      his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul,
      pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding,
      beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of
      some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive
      thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In
      this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes
      diffused through time and space; like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic
      ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.
    </p>
<p>
      There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
      gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the
      inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move
      your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes
      back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at
      mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop
      through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for
      ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.
    </h2>
<p>
      (<i>Enter Ahab: Then, all.</i>)
    </p>
<p>
      It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
      shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway
      to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country
      gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.
    </p>
<p>
      Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
      rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
      dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
      you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you
      would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one
      unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
    </p>
<p>
      But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
      nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought
      was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast
      and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as
      he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him,
      indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.
    </p>
<p>
      “D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks
      the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”
     </p>
<p>
      The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
      the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
    </p>
<p>
      It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks,
      and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand
      grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.
    </p>
<p>
      “Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
      ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
    </p>
<p>
      “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”
     </p>
<p>
      When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not
      wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the
      weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing
      over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from
      his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy
      turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to
      pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb
      cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for
      the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long.
      Vehemently pausing, he cried:—
    </p>
<p>
      “What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
      voices.
    </p>
<p>
      “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
      hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
      thrown them.
    </p>
<p>
      “And what do ye next, men?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Lower away, and after him!”
     </p>
<p>
      “And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
     </p>
<p>
      “A dead whale or a stove boat!”
     </p>
<p>
      More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
      countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
      gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
      themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
    </p>
<p>
      But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
      pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
      convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—
    </p>
<p>
      “All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
      whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a
      broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men.
      D’ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”
     </p>
<p>
      While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly
      rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten
      its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to
      himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it
      seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.
    </p>
<p>
      Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
      with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other,
      and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises me a
      white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye
      raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his
      starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white
      whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed
      the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:
      “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
      if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”
     </p>
<p>
      All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more
      intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the
      wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately
      touched by some specific recollection.
    </p>
<p>
      “Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that
      some call Moby Dick.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the
      Gay-Header deliberately.
    </p>
<p>
      “And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a
      parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”
     </p>
<p>
      “And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
      Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him—him—”
       faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though
      uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and
      wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock
      of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual
      sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a
      squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen—Moby
      Dick—Moby Dick!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
      been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
      struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain
      Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took
      off thy leg?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
      hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
      brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted with a
      terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; “Aye,
      aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging
      lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with measureless
      imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him round Good
      Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round
      perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped
      for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all
      sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye,
      men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
      excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby
      Dick!”
     </p>
<p>
      “God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye, men.
      Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long face
      about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for
      Moby Dick?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
      Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came
      here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many barrels will
      thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will
      not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a
      little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the
      accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
      girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let
      me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium <i>here!</i>”
     </p>
<p>
      “He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it
      rings most vast, but hollow.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee from
      blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab,
      seems blasphemous.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
      are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act,
      the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing
      puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.
      If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
      outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is
      that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond. But
      ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,
      with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly
      what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale
      principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,
      man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then
      could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein,
      jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even
      that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye!
      more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou
      reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye,
      Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men
      from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let
      it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living,
      breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards—the
      unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no
      reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they
      not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he
      laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the
      general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it?
      Reckon it. ’Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck.
      What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all
      Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has
      clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow
      lifts thee! Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, <i>that</i>
      voices thee. (<i>Aside</i>) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has
      inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now,
      without rebellion.”
     </p>
<p>
      “God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.
    </p>
<p>
      But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did
      not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold;
      nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the
      hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts
      sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up with the
      stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on;
      the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye
      admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye
      predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from
      without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For with little
      external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these
      still drive us on.
    </p>
<p>
      “The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered
      them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the
      capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood
      at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s company formed a
      circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every
      man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the
      prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their
      head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden
      snare of the Indian.
    </p>
<p>
      “Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
      nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
      draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it
      goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
      serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
      way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
      brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
    </p>
<p>
      “Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye
      mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with
      your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort
      revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will
      yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand
      it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer’t not thou St.
      Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!
    </p>
<p>
      “Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
      touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level,
      radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and
      nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to
      Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless,
      interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery
      emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The
      three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb
      and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell
      downright.
    </p>
<p>
      “In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but once
      take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, <i>that</i> had perhaps
      expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.
      Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye
      three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three most
      honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the
      task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his
      tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, <i>that</i> shall
      bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw
      the poles, ye harpooneers!”
     </p>
<p>
      Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
      detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
      up, before him.
    </p>
<p>
      “Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not
      the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance.
      The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith, slowly going
      from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the
      fiery waters from the pewter.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
      them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
      Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
      it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful
      whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not
      hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
      and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were
      simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and
      shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds
      among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all
      dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.

      CHAPTER 37. Sunset.
    </h2>
<p>
<i>The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I
      sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but
      first I pass.
    </p>
<p>
      Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The
      gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
      down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the
      crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright
      with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel
      that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not
      gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my
      brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the
      sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
    </p>
<p>
      Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me,
      so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all
      loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted with the high
      perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most
      malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night—good night!
      (<i>waving his hand, he moves from the window</i>.)
    </p>
<p>
      ’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
      but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
      revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand
      before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match
      itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and what I’ve
      willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m demoniac,
      I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to comprehend
      itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and—Aye! I
      lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now,
      then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s more than ye, ye great
      gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,
      ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to
      bullies—Take some one of your own size; don’t pommel <i>me!</i> No, ye’ve
      knocked me down, and I am up again; but <i>ye</i> have run and hidden. Come forth
      from behind your cotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s
      compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot
      swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The
      path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is
      grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of
      mountains, under torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle,
      naught’s an angle to the iron way!

    </p>
<p>
      My soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!
      Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But he
      drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his
      impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the
      ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have no knife
      to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he would be
      a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I
      plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse yet,
      to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would
      shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow wide. The
      hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish
      has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. I
      would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole clock’s run down; my
      heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.

      Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
      mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale is
      their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward! mark
      the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost through
      the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to
      drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin,
      builded over the dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its
      wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills me through! Peace! ye revellers,
      and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in an hour like this, with soul beat
      down and held to knowledge,—as wild, untutored things are forced to
      feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee!
      but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the
      human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand
      by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!

      Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it

      laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what
      will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all
      predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye
      Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the
      old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift,
      might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon his
      skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, <i>wise</i> Stubb—that’s my title—well,
      Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be

      the watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,

      bells there below! Tumble up!

<p>
      DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
      this in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as filliping
      to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
      butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail ’em through
      it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em it’s the

      OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
      they are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the
      bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners.
      O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well,
      well; belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so
      ’tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you’re young; I was
      once.

      3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling
      after whales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.

<p>
      MALTESE SAILOR. (<i>Reclining and shaking his cap</i>.) It’s the waves—the
      snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now
      would all the waves were women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with them
      evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match it!—as
      those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
      over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
    </p>

      SICILIAN SAILOR. (<i>Reclining</i>.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet
      interlacings of the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings!
      lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
      else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (<i>Nudging</i>.)
    </p>
<p>
      TAHITAN SAILOR. (<i>Reclining on a mat</i>.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing
      girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still
      rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the
      wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted
      quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be
      transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee’s peak
      of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?—The
      blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (<i>Leaps to his feet</i>.)
    </p>
<p>
      PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand by
      for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
      they’ll go lunging presently.
    </p>
<p>
      DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
      holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more
      afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
      storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!
    </p>
<p>
      4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab
      tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
      waterspout with a pistol—fire your ship right into it!
    </p>
<p>
      ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the

    </p>
<p>
      OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of
      tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none but the
      crew’s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather
      when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain
      has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there’s another in the sky—lurid-like,
      ye see, all else pitch black.

<p>
      ST. JAGO’S SAILOR. That Spaniard’s mad or drunk. But that can’t be, or

<p>
      OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring
      Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad’st thou

      PIP (<i>shrinking under the windlass</i>). Jollies? Lord help such jollies!
      Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip,
      here comes the royal yard! It’s worse than being in the whirled woods, the
      last day of the year! Who’d go climbing after chestnuts now? But there
      they go, all cursing, and here I don’t. Fine prospects to ’em; they’re on
      the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps
      there are worse yet—they are your white squalls, they. White
      squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just
      now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but spoken of once! and
      only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine—that
      anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God
      aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy
      down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
    </h2>
<p>
      I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my
      oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I
      hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild,
      mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud seemed
      mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster
      against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and
      revenge.
    </p>
<p>
      For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
      White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the
      Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a
      few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who
      as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.
      For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they
      were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them
      adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom
      or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a
      single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each
      separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all
      these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the
      spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
      individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,
      that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time,
      or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and
      malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
      completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I
      say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick.
      Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not
      unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
      attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
      battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
      content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the
      perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.
      In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale
      had hitherto been popularly regarded.
    </p>
<p>
      And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
      caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
      them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
      whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these
      assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,
      or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of fatality;
      those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their
      terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude
      of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually
      come.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
      horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
      fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
      terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,
      in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
      abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And
      as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
      surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
      fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
      are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness
      hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the
      most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly
      astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest
      marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest
      waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand
      shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught
      hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,
      pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by
      influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty
      birth.
    </p>
<p>
      No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the
      widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the
      end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
      half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually
      invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly
      appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that
      few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of
      those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.
    </p>
<p>
      But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
      Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,
      as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died
      out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among
      them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to
      the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps—either from professional
      inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the
      Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among
      those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never
      hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the
      leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the
      North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
      fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.
      Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere
      more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.
    </p>
<p>
      And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
      times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists—Olassen
      and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a
      consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
      incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor
      even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost similar
      impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms
      that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are “struck
      with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the precipitancy of their
      flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause
      instantaneous death.” And however the general experiences in the fishery
      may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to
      the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in
      some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
    </p>
<p>
      So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
      the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the
      Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised
      Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;
      such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully
      pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm
      Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to
      be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable
      documents that may be consulted.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were
      ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing
      only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of
      any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were
      sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.
    </p>
<p>
      One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
      with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the
      unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been
      encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
      without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets
      of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most
      erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the
      surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from
      time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory
      speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes
      whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such
      vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.
    </p>
<p>
      It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as
      well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that
      some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies
      have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is
      it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared
      that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded
      very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some
      whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never
      a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of
      living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
      mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which
      the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more
      wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were
      believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these
      fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the
      whalemen.
    </p>
<p>
      Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
      that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;
      it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still
      further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous,
      but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves
      of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away
      unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a
      sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows
      hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
      the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the
      imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk
      that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was
      elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a
      high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the
      tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his
      identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
    </p>
<p>
      The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
      same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
      appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his
      vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,
      leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
      gleamings.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
      deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
      as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
      accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than
      all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
      else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent
      symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly,
      and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or
      drive them back in consternation to their ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
      disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the
      fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s infernal
      aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused,
      was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent
      agent.
    </p>
<p>
      Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his
      more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats,
      and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds
      of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that
      smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
    </p>
<p>
      His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
      eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
      dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
      with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That
      captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
      sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab’s leg,
      as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired
      Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small
      reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
      encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all
      the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to
      identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual
      and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the
      monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men
      feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
      half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning;
      to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the
      worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue
      devil;—Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but
      deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted
      himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments;
      all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all
      that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of
      life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and
      made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white
      hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from
      Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot
      heart’s shell upon it.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the
      precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,
      knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal
      animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but
      felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this
      collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and
      weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in
      mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his
      torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made
      him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the
      encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from
      the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
      and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his
      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his
      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in
      his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the
      gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with
      mild stun’sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all
      appearances, the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape
      Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light
      and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
      and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved
      on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you
      think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler
      form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like
      the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but
      unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing
      monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been left behind; so in
      that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had
      perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If
      such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general
      sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own
      mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one
      end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely
      brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.
    </p>
<p>
      This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But
      vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far
      down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we
      here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take
      your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
      where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root of
      grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried
      beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the
      great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits,
      upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down
      there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family
      likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your
      grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are
      sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change,
      or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble;
      in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only
      subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless,
      so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he
      stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but
      naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which
      had overtaken him.
    </p>
<p>
      The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
      ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
      always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present
      voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far
      from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of
      such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were
      inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the
      better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and
      wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without,
      with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one,
      could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his
      lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason
      thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would
      seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
      attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret
      of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed
      upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of
      hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but
      half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast
      and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They
      were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars
      from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and
      supernatural revenge.
    </p>
<p>
      Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
      Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up
      of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled
      also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
      Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
      Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered,
      seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
      to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded
      to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
      that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their
      insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be—what the White
      Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in
      some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of
      the seas of life,—all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
      Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one
      tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
      pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a
      seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment
      of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the
      whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
    </h2>
<p>
      What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was
      to me, as yet remains unsaid.
    </p>
<p>
      Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
      could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there was
      another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at
      times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so
      mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting
      it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above
      all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and
      yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these
      chapters might be naught.
    </p>
<p>
      Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as
      if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and
      pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain
      royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu
      placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other
      magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam
      unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the
      Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the
      great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the
      imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it
      applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership
      over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
      even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
      marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
      symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble
      things—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among
      the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the
      deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the
      majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the
      daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in
      the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the
      symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire
      worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar;
      and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a
      snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice
      of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology,
      that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could
      send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity;
      and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests
      derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
      worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish
      faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of
      our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the
      redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the
      great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool;
      yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
      honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
      innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than
      that redness which affrights in blood.
    </p>
<p>
      This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
      divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
      terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
      Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;
      what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors
      they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent
      mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their
      aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so
      stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
    </p>
<p>
      *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
      would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness,
      separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that
      brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only
      rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the
      creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love;
      and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,
      the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even
      assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you
      would not have that intensified terror.
    </p>
<p>
      As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
      creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
      same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit
      by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for
      the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence <i>Requiem</i>
      denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in
      allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the
      mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him <i>Requin</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
      wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
      imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,
      unflattering laureate, Nature.*
    </p>
<p>
      *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
      gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
      below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main
      hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a
      hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast
      archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and
      throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some
      king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange
      eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham
      before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings
      so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable
      warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy
      of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through
      me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was
      this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it
      conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore!
      never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman’s name
      for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have
      had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I
      saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor
      knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly
      burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
    </p>
<p>
      I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly
      lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a
      solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I
      have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the
      Antarctic fowl.
    </p>
<p>
      But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell;
      with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last
      the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round
      its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting it escape. But
      I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven,
      when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and
      adoring cherubim!
    </p>
<p>
      Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the
      White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,
      small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs
      in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast
      herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the
      Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward
      trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of
      light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail,
      invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters
      could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of
      that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and
      hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked
      majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether
      marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that
      endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
      circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed
      gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool
      milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest
      Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be
      questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that
      it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with
      divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though
      commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
    </p>
<p>
      But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
      accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
      Albatross.
    </p>
<p>
      What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
      the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
      that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears.
      The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive deformity—and
      yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely
      hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the
      less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning
      attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of
      the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some
      historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an
      auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in
      Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the
      desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind
      fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be
      doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most
      appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that
      pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as
      of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow
      the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our
      superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our
      phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while these
      terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when
      personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
    </p>
<p>
      Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing
      he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized
      significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
    </p>
<p>
      But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
      account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the
      citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness—though
      for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct
      associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless,
      is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;—can we
      thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause
      we seek?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and
      without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
      though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to
      be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
      entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
      recall them now.
    </p>
<p>
      Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
      acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention
      of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
      processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen
      snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American
      States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun,
      evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings
      (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of
      London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled
      American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors—the
      Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White
      Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic
      ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while the
      thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant
      dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the
      name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while that
      of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild
      afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of
      sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed
      to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does
      “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor
      unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this
      phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
    </p>
<p>
      Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
      earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness
      of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning
      spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of
      anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon
      each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it is not these things alone
      which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can’st see. For
      Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this
      whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for
      ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads
      over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its
      own distortions.
    </p>
<p>
      I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is
      not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects
      otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror
      in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely
      consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form
      at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two
      statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following
      examples.
    </p>
<p>
      First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
      night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just
      enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely
      similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship
      sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from
      encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him,
      then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the
      whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead
      assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down;
      he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the
      mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking
      hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?”
     </p>
<p>
      Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
      snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere
      fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
      altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
      lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
      backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
      unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to
      break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the
      scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of
      legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
      shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,
      views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
      ice monuments and splintered crosses.
    </p>
<p>
      But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a
      white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,
      Ishmael.
    </p>
<p>
      Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
      Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the
      sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he
      cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
      will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
      of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
      creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
      smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
      former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black
      bisons of distant Oregon?
    </p>
<p>
      No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
      knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
      Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison
      herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which
      this instant they may be trampling into dust.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
      the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed
      snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that
      buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
    </p>
<p>
      Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
      sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
      those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world
      seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
    </p>
<p>
      But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned
      why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more
      portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning
      symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian’s Deity;
      and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most
      appalling to mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and
      immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
      thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way?
      Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the
      visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
      colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full
      of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour of
      atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of
      the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately
      or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods;
      yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
      young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in
      substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature
      absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the
      charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the
      mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
      principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if
      operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips
      and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied
      universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland,
      who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the
      wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that
      wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino
      whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?

      CHAPTER 43. Hark!
    </h2>
<p>
      “HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
     </p>
<p>
      It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
      cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
      scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to
      fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed
      precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle
      their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
      only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
      unceasingly advancing keel.
    </p>
<p>
      It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose
      post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the
      words above.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”
     </p>
<p>
      “There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a
      cough—it sounded like a cough.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
     </p>
<p>
      “There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers
      turning over, now!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits ye
      eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the
      bucket!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old
      Quakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re the
      chap.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
      down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect
      our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one
      morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind.”
     </p>

<h2>
      CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
    </h2>
<p>
      Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
      took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
      with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and
      bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them
      before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you
      would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which
      there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional
      courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer
      to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons
      and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm
      whales had been captured or seen.
    </p>
<p>
      While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
      head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
      shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
      almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on
      the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
      courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
    </p>
<p>
      But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
      cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
      brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others
      were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab
      was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more
      certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it
      might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
      creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to
      Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating
      the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling to mind the
      regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes;
      could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties,
      concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of
      his prey.
    </p>
<p>
      So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm
      whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could
      he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for
      one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the
      migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
      invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.
      On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
      charts of the sperm whale.*
    </p>
<pre>
     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne
     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of
     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By
     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in
     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in
     the circular. “This chart divides the ocean into districts
     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;
     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number
     of days that have been spent in each month in every
     district, and the two others to show the number of days in
     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”
 </pre>
<p>
      Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
      sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret
      intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in <i>veins</i>, as they are
      called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
      undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart,
      with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
      direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel, and
      though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,
      straight wake, yet the arbitrary <i>vein</i> in which at these times he is said
      to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the
      vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual
      sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along
      this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that
      breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be
      looked for.
    </p>
<p>
      And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
      feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
      the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,
      so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
      without prospect of a meeting.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
      delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps.
      Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for
      particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds
      which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will
      turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the
      preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances
      where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,
      only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among
      the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former
      year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the
      Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,
      that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
      corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,
      with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.
      But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to
      speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of
      accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only
      been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere
      a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would
      become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
      next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were
      conjoined in the one technical phrase—the Season-on-the-Line. For
      there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
      periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,
      in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of
      the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the
      white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;
      there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the
      awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and
      unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this
      unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon
      the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to
      those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize
      his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
      Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander
      to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running
      down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to
      cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the
      premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly
      selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because,
      an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before
      him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would
      spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his
      vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should
      turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or
      China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,
      Pampas, Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and
      Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
      Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.
    </p>
<p>
      But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not
      but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
      whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual
      recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged
      thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of
      Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And
      have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after
      poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself
      back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins
      are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear! And here, his mad
      mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of
      pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to
      recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man
      endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps
      with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.
    </p>
<p>
      Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
      dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the
      day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round
      and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his
      life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the
      case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and
      a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings
      shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when
      this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through
      the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as
      though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead
      of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at
      his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at
      such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the
      white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent
      that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the
      eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time
      dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it
      for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was
      no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
      the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding up
      all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by
      its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils
      into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could
      grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,
      fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore,
      the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab
      rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless
      somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an
      object to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old
      man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
      thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for
      ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.
    </h2>
<p>
      So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
      indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in
      the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is
      as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter
      of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in
      order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any
      incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in
      some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.
    </p>
<p>
      I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
      content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items,
      practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these
      citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow
      of itself.
    </p>
<p>
      First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
      receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
      interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
      same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private
      cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years
      intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may
      have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in
      the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore
      there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,
      where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by
      serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common
      perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,
      the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it
      had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the
      coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came
      together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known
      three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales
      struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective
      marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year
      instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and
      last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole
      under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I
      say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are
      three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have
      heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter
      there is no good ground to impeach.
    </p>
<p>
      Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
      the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
      historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
      distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
      thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
      peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in
      that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
      peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
      valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of
      the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a
      whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen
      were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he
      would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to
      cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that
      happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
      salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance
      further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
    </p>
<p>
      But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
      celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
      famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but
      he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a
      name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not so, O
      Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long
      did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen
      from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou
      terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the
      Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they
      say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?
      Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old
      tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are
      four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
      Sylla to the classic scholar.
    </p>
<p>
      But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
      times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
      finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by
      valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express
      object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods,
      Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious
      murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
      mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
      printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole
      story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one
      of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much
      bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest
      and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching
      the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might
      scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more
      detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
    </p>
<p>
      First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
      perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
      conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One
      reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
      deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
      however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose
      that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
      whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the
      bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that
      poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
      to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular
      between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be
      called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you
      that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many
      others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death
      by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a
      boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles!
      not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man’s blood was spilled
      for it.
    </p>
<p>
      Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
      an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
      narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,
      they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I
      declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,
      when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
      testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
      Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
      malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
      sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale <i>has</i> done it.
    </p>
<p>
      First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was
      cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats,
      and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales
      were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,
      issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his
      forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than “ten
      minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has
      been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the
      land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once
      more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
      shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time
      his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never
      tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.
      I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the
      tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed
      with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the
      catastrophe.*
    </p>
<p>
      *The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to
      warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed
      his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short
      interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were
      calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby
      combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the
      exact manœuvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most
      horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from
      the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck
      three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.”
       Again: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all
      happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in
      my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many
      of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that
      I am correct in my opinion.”
     </p>
<p>
      Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black
      night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable
      shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of
      being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks,
      with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed
      scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and <i>the
      horrid aspect and revenge of the whale</i>, wholly engrossed my reflections,
      until day again made its appearance.”
     </p>
<p>
      In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “<i>the mysterious and
      mortal attack of the animal</i>.”
     </p>
<p>
      Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally
      lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of
      this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale
      hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.
    </p>
<p>
      Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
      commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
      dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the
      harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the
      Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
      ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
      denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
      as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is
      more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable
      craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm
      whale, that begged a few moments’ confidential business with him. That
      business consisted in fetching the Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that
      with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave
      down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s
      interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus
      converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale
      will stand no nonsense.
    </p>
<p>
      I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance in
      point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must
      know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s famous
      Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain
      Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
    </p>
<p>
      “By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we
      were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very
      clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
      our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till
      the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon
      large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost
      at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board
      till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon
      him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We
      were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,
      setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.
      The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
      all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon
      some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost
      gravity and solemnity. Captain D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to
      examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,
      but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”
     </p>
<p>
      Now, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
      question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures
      as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near
      Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly
      questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates
      every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian
      craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after
      bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
    </p>
<p>
      In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,
      of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
      Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that
      just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
      corroborative example, if such be needed.
    </p>
<p>
      Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
      modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four o’clock
      in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the
      Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such
      consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to
      think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock
      was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck
      against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the
      lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock
      made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken
      out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was
      thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an
      earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a
      great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
      mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
      darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused
      by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
    </p>
<p>
      I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
      me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me
      say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running
      sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured
      there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks
      off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm
      whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often
      with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
      pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
      character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and
      retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I
      must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a
      remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,
      that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by
      plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)
      are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say
      amen with Solomon—Verily there is nothing new under the sun.
    </p>
<p>
      In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of
      Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius
      general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every
      way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been
      considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some
      one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be
      mentioned.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of
      his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the
      neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels
      at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact
      thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is
      there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster
      was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other
      reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a
      sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the
      sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep
      waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
      and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place
      for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have
      recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated
      instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am
      told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of
      the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of
      war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by
      the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
    </p>
<p>
      In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance
      called <i>brit</i> is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have
      every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale—squid or
      cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large
      creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at
      its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and
      reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all
      human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for half a century stove
      the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
      whale.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
    </h2>
<p>
      Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
      thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
      though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
      passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
      habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether to
      abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were
      otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with
      him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his
      monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might
      have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that
      the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances
      that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one
      he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were
      still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according
      with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of
      swaying him.
    </p>
<p>
      To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the
      shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for
      example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over
      Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any
      more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for
      to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal
      relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced will were Ahab’s, so long
      as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain; still he knew that for all
      this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain’s quest, and could
      he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It
      might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.
      During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open
      relapses of rebellion against his captain’s leadership, unless some
      ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon
      him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick
      was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and
      shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some
      way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally
      invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn
      into the obscure background (for few men’s courage is proof against
      protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their
      long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
      think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage
      crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all
      sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the
      varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when
      retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
      promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
      requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and
      hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
      mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
      The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
      Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
      hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
      breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the
      love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for
      their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric
      Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of
      land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
      picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they
      been strictly held to their one final and romantic object—that final
      and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will
      not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash—aye, cash.
      They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective
      promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once
      mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to
      Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat
      prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod’s voyage,
      Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid
      himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect
      impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end
      competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently
      wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of
      usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression
      gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect
      himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain
      and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
      every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to
      be subjected to.
    </p>
<p>
      For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally
      developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree
      continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s voyage;
      observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to
      evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of
      his profession.
    </p>
<p>
      Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
      mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
      reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.
    </h2>
<p>
      It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about
      the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg
      and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an
      additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow
      preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in
      the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible
      self.
    </p>
<p>
      I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept
      passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long
      yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg,
      standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the
      threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly
      drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign
      all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting
      dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time,
      and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the
      Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single,
      ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to
      admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This
      warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own
      shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,
      Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
      slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
      and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
      contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s sword,
      thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this
      easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free will, and
      necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working
      together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
      ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only
      tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given
      threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines
      of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
      thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last
      featuring blow at events.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
      strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
      free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence
      that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad
      Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand
      stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his
      cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard
      all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen’s look-outs perched as high
      in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have
      derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.
    </p>
<p>
      As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly
      peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or
      seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing
      their coming.
    </p>
<p>
      “There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Where-away?”
     </p>
<p>
      “On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”
     </p>
<p>
      Instantly all was commotion.
    </p>
<p>
      The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
      reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other
      tribes of his genus.
    </p>
<p>
      “There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
      disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      “Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”
     </p>
<p>
      Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
      minute to Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
      before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
      leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
      our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
      when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
      concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the
      opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
      action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego
      had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of
      the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not appointed to the
      boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors
      at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their
      places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three
      boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.
      Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail,
      while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long
      line of man-of-war’s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy’s
      ship.
    </p>
<p>
      But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
      every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
      surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.

      CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.
    </h2>
<p>
      The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of
      the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles
      and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed
      one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain’s, on
      account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now
      stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly
      protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black
      cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark
      stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited
      turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.
      Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
      tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the
      Manillas;—a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and
      by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret
      confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose
      counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.
    </p>
<p>
      While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these strangers,
      Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, “All ready
      there, Fedallah?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.
    </p>
<p>
      “Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away there,
      I say.”
     </p>
<p>
      Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
      sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a
      wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
      off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like,
      leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed boats below.
    </p>
<p>
      Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth keel,
      coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed
      the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly
      hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to
      cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon
      the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not
      the command.
    </p>
<p>
      “Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.
    </p>
<p>
      “Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask,
      pull out more to leeward!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great
      steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew. “There!—there!—there
      again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay back!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it
      all before now. Didn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I
      tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
      ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
      still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones, my
      boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are
      only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the
      more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils
      are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for
      a thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
      gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts
      alive! Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why
      don’t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so,
      so, then:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and
      strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin
      rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.
      Pull, will ye? pull, can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons
      and ginger-cakes don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and
      start your eyes out! Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;
      “every mother’s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between
      his teeth. That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like
      it, my steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,
      marling-spikes!”
     </p>
<p>
      Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather
      a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
      inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
      specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
      with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
      peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone
      so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated
      merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer
      invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere
      joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent
      himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped—open-mouthed
      at times—that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer
      force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was
      one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so
      curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter
      of obeying them.
    </p>
<p>
      In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
      across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty
      near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
      please!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke;
      still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a
      flint from Stubb’s.
    </p>
<p>
      “What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
      boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad
      business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
      Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
      will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
      Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the
      play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
      diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s
      what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
      suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom of
      it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It
      ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”
     </p>
<p>
      Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as
      the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
      awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s company;
      but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among
      them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure
      prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder;
      and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of accounting for
      their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious
      surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of
      wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in the matter from the
      beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen
      creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
      enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest
      to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance
      bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures
      of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose
      and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the
      boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi
      steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had
      thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the
      whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the
      alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of
      the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer’s, thrown half backward into
      the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen
      steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the
      White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar
      motion and then remained fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen
      simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly
      the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had
      irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly
      discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab
      had observed it.
    </p>
<p>
      “Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
      stand up!”
     </p>
<p>
      Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
      stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
      spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
      stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the
      gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself
      to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the
      vast blue eye of the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its
      commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort
      of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of
      the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its
      top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand, and standing upon
      such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship
      which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small and
      short, and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall
      ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means
      satisfy King-Post.
    </p>
<p>
      “I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
      that.”
     </p>
<p>
      Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
      swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
      shoulders for a pedestal.
    </p>
<p>
      “Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”
     </p>
<p>
      “That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
      fifty feet taller.”
     </p>
<p>
      Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
      boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
      Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head and
      bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling
      landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask
      now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband
      to lean against and steady himself by.
    </p>
<p>
      At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
      habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture
      in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and
      cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the
      loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask
      mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself
      with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble
      negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his
      broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked
      nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious
      little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added
      heave did he thereby give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen
      Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth
      did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.
      The whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary
      dive from mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in
      such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with
      his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant
      like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his
      thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper
      of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to
      windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect
      attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down
      all, and give way!—there they are!”
     </p>
<p>
      To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
      visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
      water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
      suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
      rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were,
      like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
      atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
      water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
      indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
      couriers and detached flying outriders.
    </p>
<p>
      All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water
      and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass
      of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.
    </p>
<p>
      “Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
      intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
      from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
      visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to
      his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence
      of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar
      whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
    </p>
<p>
      How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something, my
      hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their
      black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you my
      Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay
      me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!
      See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his
      head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far
      off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat’s
      stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
    </p>
<p>
      “Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
      unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short
      distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes,
      give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em.
      Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s
      the word. Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the
      devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only
      pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite
      your knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take
      it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”
     </p>
<p>
      But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
      his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the
      blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the
      audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and
      eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask
      to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to
      be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its tail—these
      allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would
      cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the
      shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out
      their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that
      they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these
      critical moments.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
      omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along
      the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the
      brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the
      knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to
      cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows;
      the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the
      headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;—all these, with the
      cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the
      oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her
      boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;—all
      this was thrilling.
    </p>
<p>
      Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
      heat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the first
      unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel
      stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time
      finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm
      whale.
    </p>
<p>
      The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
      visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung
      upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere
      to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats
      were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead
      to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we
      rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that the
      lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from
      the row-locks.
    </p>
<p>
      Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship
      nor boat to be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      “Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
      of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
      There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”
     </p>
<p>
      Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that
      the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a
      lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and Queequeg,
      harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
    </p>
<p>
      Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so
      close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the
      mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had
      come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants
      stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the
      mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of
      enraged serpents.
    </p>
<p>
      “That’s his hump. <i>There</i>, <i>there</i>, give it to him!” whispered Starbuck.
    </p>
<p>
      A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
      Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
      astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
      collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
      something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew
      were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white
      curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended
      together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
    </p>
<p>
      Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it
      we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
      tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the
      water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes
      the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of
      the ocean.
    </p>
<p>
      The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
      the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire
      upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these
      jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live
      coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that
      storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the
      shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea
      forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as
      propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the
      lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck
      contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif
      pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.
      There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that
      almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man
      without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.
    </p>
<p>
      Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we
      lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the
      sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly
      Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard
      a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The
      sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge,
      vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last
      loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much
      more than its length.
    </p>
<p>
      Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
      tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a
      cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more
      till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed
      against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on
      board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from
      their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us
      up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of our
      perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
    </h2>
<p>
      There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
      we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
      joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects
      that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own. However, nothing
      dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all
      events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible
      and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion
      gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and
      worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all
      these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and
      jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old
      joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man
      only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of
      his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing
      most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing
      like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial,
      desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the
      Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.
    </p>
<p>
      “Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
      and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
      “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?” Without
      much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand
      that such things did often happen.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
      oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I
      think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
      mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
      then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
      squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape
      Horn.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close
      by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me
      whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an
      oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death’s
      jaws?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I should
      like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha,
      ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!”
     </p>
<p>
      Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of
      the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in
      the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common
      occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively
      critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the
      hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow who at that
      very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft
      with his own frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster
      to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck’s driving
      on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
      Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the
      fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s
      boat; and finally considering in what a devil’s chase I was implicated,
      touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I
      might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said
      I, “come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”
     </p>
<p>
      It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
      last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond
      of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had
      done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present
      occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart.
      Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that
      Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so
      many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my death and
      burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and
      contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the
      bars of a snug family vault.
    </p>
<p>
      Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
      here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
      devil fetch the hindmost.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
    </h2>
<p>
      “Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg you
      would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my
      timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask. “If
      his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That
      would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left,
      you know.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”
     </p>
<p>
      Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the
      paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right
      for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the
      chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes,
      whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest
      of the fight.
    </p>
<p>
      But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
      with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
      considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
      extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
      comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man
      to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of
      the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
    </p>
<p>
      Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his
      entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the
      chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his
      orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned
      to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for Captain Ahab
      to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s crew, he well knew
      that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the
      Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s crew from them, nor had he
      in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken
      private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco’s
      published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure
      when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the
      customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time
      after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
      making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the
      spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which
      when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when
      all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an
      extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
      withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he
      evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is
      sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing the
      knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
      often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
      semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter’s chisel
      gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these
      things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But
      almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in
      Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he
      had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.
      But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as
      to any boat’s crew being assigned to that boat.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away;
      for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
      unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
      nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers;
      and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found
      tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats,
      canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself
      might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the
      captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the
      forecastle.
    </p>
<p>
      But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
      phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
      somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
      muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this,
      by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked
      with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a
      half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority
      over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air
      concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people
      in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but
      the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic
      communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent—those
      insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern
      days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal
      generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection,
      and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as
      real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
      to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
      consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical
      Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.
    </h2>
<p>
      Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept
      across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de
      Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la
      Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from
      St. Helena.
    </p>
<p>
      It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
      moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and,
      by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence,
      not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in
      advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked
      celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.
      Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was
      his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with
      the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales
      were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering
      for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this
      old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon,
      companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there
      for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after
      all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery,
      moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some
      winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.
      “There she blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have
      quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though
      it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so
      deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively
      desired a lowering.
    </p>
<p>
      Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
      t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best
      man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the
      piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving,
      lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many
      sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet;
      while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were
      struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive
      yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab’s face that
      night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were
      warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every
      stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this
      old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every
      eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more
      seen that night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.
    </p>
<p>
      This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
      after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was
      descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
      disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
      night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into
      the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing
      again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at
      every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our
      van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with
      the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the
      Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and
      wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart
      latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same
      whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense
      of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously
      beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon
      us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.
    </p>
<p>
      These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
      potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath
      all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for
      days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild,
      that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating
      itself of life before our urn-like prow.
    </p>
<p>
      But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling
      around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are
      there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored
      the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the
      foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life
      went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.
    </p>
<p>
      Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
      before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
      every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
      spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as
      though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing
      appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their
      homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black
      sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul
      were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.
    </p>
<p>
      Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of
      yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended
      us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty
      beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to
      swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air
      without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing
      its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before,
      the solitary jet would at times be descried.
    </p>
<p>
      During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the
      time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,
      manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his
      mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft
      has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the
      issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So,
      with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand
      firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead
      to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but
      congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the
      forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over
      its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better
      to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
      sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
      belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
      painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
      madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of
      humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the
      men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even
      when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose
      in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man’s aspect, when one
      night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw
      him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain
      and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
      emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the
      table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
      which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly
      clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that
      the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that
      swung from a beam in the ceiling.*
    </p>
<p>
      *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the
      compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the
      course of the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale,
      still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.
    </h2>
<p>
      South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
      ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by
      name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head,
      I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean
      fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
    </p>
<p>
      As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
      skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
      appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her
      spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
      with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see
      her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in
      the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived
      nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast,
      they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship
      slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to
      each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
      ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly
      eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while
      the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the
      act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand
      into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make
      himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the
      distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod
      were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere
      mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for a moment
      paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board
      the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage
      of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her
      aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home,
      he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the
      world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and
      this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them
      to ——”
     </p>
<p>
      At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in
      accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that
      for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away
      with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with
      the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings
      Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any
      monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.
    </p>
<p>
      “Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
      There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
      helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But
      turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the
      wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,—“Up
      helm! Keep her off round the world!”

<p>
      Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
      but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
      numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we
      left behind secure, were all the time before us.
    </p>
<p>
      Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
      ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than
      any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the
      voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented
      chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all
      human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead
      us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 53. The Gam.
    </h2>
<p>
      The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
      spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this not
      been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her—judging
      by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had been
      that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the
      question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to
      consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could
      contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But all this
      might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said here of the
      peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign
      seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.
    </p>
<p>
      If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
      equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each
      other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them,
      cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to
      interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting
      in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine
      Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying
      each other at the ends of the earth—off lone Fanning’s Island, or
      the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such
      circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into
      still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would
      this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one
      seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are
      personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear
      domestic things to talk about.
    </p>
<p>
      For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
      board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date
      a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files.
      And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the
      latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be
      destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this
      will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on
      the cruising-ground itself, even though they are equally long absent from
      home. For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some
      third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the
      people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling
      news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all
      the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
      congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
      privations and perils.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that
      is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with
      Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of
      English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they do
      occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your
      Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that
      sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers
      sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American
      whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript
      provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in
      the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing
      that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the
      English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little foible
      in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to
      heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.
    </p>
<p>
      So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers
      have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some
      merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
      oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
      mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in
      Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon
      each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they
      first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a
      ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty
      good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships
      meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each
      other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross
      each other’s cross-bones, the first hail is—“How many skulls?”—the
      same way that whalers hail—“How many barrels?” And that question
      once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal
      villains on both sides, and don’t like to see overmuch of each other’s
      villanous likenesses.
    </p>
<p>
      But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
      free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
      whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “<i>Gam</i>,” a thing so utterly
      unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and if
      by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat
      gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and such like
      pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all
      Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a
      scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard
      to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know
      whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It
      sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And
      besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper
      foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting
      himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate
      has no solid basis to stand on.
    </p>
<p>
      But what is a <i>Gam?</i> You might wear out your index-finger running up and
      down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson
      never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not hold it.
      Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in
      constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it
      needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With that
      view, let me learnedly define it.
    </p>
<p>
      GAM. NOUN—<i>A social meeting of two</i> (<i>or more</i>) <i>Whaleships,
      generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits
      by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one
      ship, and the two chief mates on the other.</i>
</p>
<p>
      There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
      here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
      has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the
      captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets
      on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself
      with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with gay cords and
      ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort
      whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains
      were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent
      chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such
      effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat’s crew must leave
      the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,
      that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,
      having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a
      pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of
      the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships,
      this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his
      dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in
      his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then
      in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees
      in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only
      expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a
      sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because
      length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make
      a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it
      would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would never
      do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the
      slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as
      token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands
      in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy
      hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred
      instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known
      for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say—to
      seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s hair, and hold on there like grim
      death.

      CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.
    </h2>
<p>
      (<i>As told at the Golden Inn.</i>)
    </p>
<p>
      The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
      much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more
      travellers than in any other part.
    </p>
<p>
      It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound
      whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by
      Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby
      Dick. To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly
      heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’s story, which seemed
      obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted
      visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are
      said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance, with its own
      particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of
      the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab
      or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain
      of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate
      white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to
      Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night
      Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way,
      that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
      Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen
      in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange
      delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept
      the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s
      main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the
      story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I
      now proceed to put on lasting record.
    </p>
<p>
      *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
      still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.
    </p>
<p>
      For my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated
      it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint’s eve,
      smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine
      cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms
      with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and
      which are duly answered at the time.
    </p>
<p>
      “Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
      rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was
      cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward from the
      eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the
      Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it
      was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They
      supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having
      some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those
      latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not
      being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not
      find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather
      heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners
      working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came;
      more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it
      sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,
      making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands,
      there to have his hull hove out and repaired.
    </p>
<p>
      “Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
      favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,
      because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at
      them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;
      never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole
      of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had
      all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the
      occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal
      overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked
      vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’
      said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
    </p>
<p>
      “On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your
      courtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
      gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large
      and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla;
      this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet been
      nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected
      with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand
      fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
      Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with
      many of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
      races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,
      even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great
      contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime
      approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all
      round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by
      the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet
      thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to
      wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry
      wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered
      forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic
      genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and
      silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they
      mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago
      villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed
      cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by
      Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave;
      they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland,
      they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.
      Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and
      wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for
      Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone
      Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had
      long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
      he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman,
      fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this
      Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
      mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible
      firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which
      is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been
      retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far;
      but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt—but, gentlemen,
      you shall hear.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow
      for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again increasing, but
      only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must
      know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example,
      some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of
      a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his
      duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates
      would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to
      the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the
      westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging
      at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable
      length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any
      other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel
      is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless
      latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.
    </p>
<p>
      “Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
      gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
      several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the
      upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded
      to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and
      as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his
      own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you
      can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this
      solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that
      it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were
      working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small
      gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet
      continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain
      spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck,
      and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
      world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in
      command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
      superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
      conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance
      he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make a little
      heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all
      events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and
      a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy’s
      snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen,
      which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to
      Charlemagne’s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as
      hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt
      knew it.
    </p>
<p>
      “Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
      rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his
      gay banterings.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one
      of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I tell ye
      what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his
      part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only
      began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,
      saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of ’em are now
      hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I
      suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him to jump overboard and
      scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.
      But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say
      the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d
      give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,
      pretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,
      lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the
      men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the
      lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s utmost
      energies.
    </p>
<p>
      “Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
      forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery
      red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now
      what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle
      with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so
      it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him
      to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove
      some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.
    </p>
<p>
      “Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household
      work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
      evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
      foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
      sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
      would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
      vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if
      boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that
      had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most
      athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain
      of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any
      trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the
      case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may
      understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.
    </p>
<p>
      “But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
      plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in
      his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand
      this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended
      when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and
      as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s malignant eye and perceived the
      stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently
      burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange
      forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any
      already ireful being—a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by
      really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom
      feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.
    </p>
<p>
      “Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
      exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the
      deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at
      all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary
      sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing
      all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and
      outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile
      advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper’s club
      hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.
    </p>
<p>
      “Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
      all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could
      but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the
      conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to
      his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few
      inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.
    </p>
<p>
      “Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
      followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his
      intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the
      slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted
      hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no
      purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;
      when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had
      now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on
      the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
      yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
      the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his
      teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
      Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
      with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right
      hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that
      if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But,
      gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.
      Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw
      of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood
      like a whale.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
      leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
      mastheads. They were both Canallers.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our
      harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are
      they?’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You
      must have heard of it.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
      land, we know but little of your vigorous North.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere
      proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such
      information may throw side-light upon my story.’
    </p>
<p>
      “For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth
      of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most
      thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent,
      cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and
      bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches
      over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken;
      through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties;
      and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires stand almost
      like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and
      often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your
      pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung
      shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by some curious
      fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they
      ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most
      abound in holiest vicinities.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
      crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in
      Lima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all us
      Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by no
      means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
      distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
      surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as
      Lima.” It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
      billiard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as Lima.” So, too,
      Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.
      Mark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now,
      you pour out again.’
    </p>
<p>
      “Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a
      fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like
      Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he
      indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening
      his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is
      dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his
      slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to
      the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart
      visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on
      his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers; I
      thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of
      the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he
      has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a
      wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is,
      is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
      many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind,
      except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor
      does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many
      thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the
      probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between
      quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the
      waters of the most barbaric seas.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon
      his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I had
      thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold and
      holy as the hills.—But the story.’
    </p>
<p>
      “I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had
      he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four
      harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes
      like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought
      to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors
      joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while
      standing out of harm’s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a
      whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious
      scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran
      close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the
      heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his
      resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all;
      they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing
      about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these
      sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them
      with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come out
      of that, ye cut-throats!’
    </p>
<p>
      “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied
      the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand
      distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal for a
      murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this
      might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still
      commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their ringleader.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you
      want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and
      he once more raised a pistol.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
      turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say
      ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.
    </p>
<p>
      “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on
      the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our
      fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy’s
      business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the
      buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw;
      ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to
      those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the
      word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us
      decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be flogged.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
      ‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for
      the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
      discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s not
      our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won’t
      be flogged.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.
    </p>
<p>
      “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you
      what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a
      shabby rascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but
      till you say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till
      ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
      it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into
      their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
    </p>
<p>
      “As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
      and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of
      the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for
      the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
      companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something
      down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten in
      number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
    </p>
<p>
      “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
      aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which
      last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking
      through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the
      men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose
      clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally
      resounded through the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned
      the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then
      lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
      after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the
      Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this
      was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a
      scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly
      four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.
      The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to
      some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at
      discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the
      rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling
      and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of
      the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that
      sought to restrain them. Only three were left.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven
      of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last
      hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the
      bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two
      Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their
      hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen
      mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each
      end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any
      devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he
      would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last
      night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition
      on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for
      any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was
      more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time
      to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely
      objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two
      comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of
      them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time.
      And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.
    </p>
<p>
      “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
      separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of
      treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the
      first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby
      secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when
      Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last,
      they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before
      secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze,
      verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound
      the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for
      the Captain at midnight.
    </p>
<p>
      “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and
      all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few
      minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
      struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies,
      who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe
      for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like
      dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging,
      like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. ‘Damn ye,’
      cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, ‘the vultures would not
      touch ye, ye villains!’
    </p>
<p>
      “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled
      from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he
      had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the whole, he
      would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the
      present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a
      reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the
      rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and,
      seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two
      traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
      sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still
      rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take that
      gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’
    </p>
<p>
      “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
      cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort
      of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me,
      I murder you!’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off
      with the rope to strike.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
    </p>
<p>
      “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;
      who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly
      two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, ‘I
      won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’
    </p>
<p>
      “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man,
      with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever
      since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
      tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole
      scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but
      mumbling something about <i>his</i> being willing and able to do what the captain
      dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking, when
      another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more,
      made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that might have
      been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and,
      sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.
    </p>
<p>
      “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was
      heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
      besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
      Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
      instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no
      sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that
      mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the
      strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship
      reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest
      end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to
      sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her
      leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her
      mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that
      moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and
      Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and
      with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
    </p>
<p>
      “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
      passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all
      was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
      had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief
      mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half
      way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against
      the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at
      night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt
      systematically built the plan of his revenge.
    </p>
<p>
      “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
      bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the
      boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In this
      attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable
      vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.
      Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm
      would come round at two o’clock, in the morning of the third day from that
      in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in
      braiding something very carefully in his watches below.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘What do you think? what does it look like?’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length before
      him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough twine,—have
      you any?’
    </p>
<p>
      “But there was none in the forecastle.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘You don’t mean to go a begging to <i>him!</i>’ said a sailor.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help himself
      in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly,
      and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him—neither
      twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball,
      closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman’s monkey
      jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow.
      Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the
      man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman’s
      hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining
      soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse,
      with his forehead crushed in.
    </p>
<p>
      “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed
      he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
      avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to
      take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
      day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man,
      drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There she
      rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales
      have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but
      that would be too long a story.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get
      more into the air, Sirs.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks
      faint;—fill up his empty glass!’
    </p>
<p>
      “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so
      suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship—forgetful
      of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the
      Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the
      monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from
      the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. ‘The White Whale—the
      White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who,
      undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and
      precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the
      appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal
      spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue
      morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of
      these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
      The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was
      his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the
      prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover,
      when the four boats were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none
      howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at
      his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in
      hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in
      a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost
      back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
      foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck
      as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing
      mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back, the boat
      righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over
      into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the
      spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly
      seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed
      round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and
      rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.
    </p>
<p>
      “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had
      slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
      looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward
      jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and
      the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some
      tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had
      destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them,
      and finally wholly disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary place—where
      no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five
      or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms;
      eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the
      savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
    </p>
<p>
      “The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
      upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down
      the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their
      dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night
      and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the
      vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition
      that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After
      taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as
      possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his
      muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at
      their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best
      whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred
      miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
    </p>
<p>
      “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed
      to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the
      savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him
      to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a
      pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman
      laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked
      in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;
      ‘no lies.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that
      he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
      stood face to face with the captain.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As
      soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island,
      and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping into
      the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
    </p>
<p>
      “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots
      of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived
      at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two
      ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of
      precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and
      so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all
      minded to work them legal retribution.
    </p>
<p>
      “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and
      the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who
      had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he
      returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again
      resumed his cruisings.
    </p>
<p>
      “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
      Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to
      give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
      destroyed him.  * * * *
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘I am, Don.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this
      your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did
      you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to
      press.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian’s
      suit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who will
      quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this
      may grow too serious.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the company
      to another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.
      Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that
      you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you
      can.’
    </p>
<p>
      * * * * * *
    </p>
<p>
      “‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don Sebastian,
      gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and
      hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
    </p>
<p>
      “‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen,
      is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it
      happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and
      talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.’”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
    </h2>
<p>
      I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something
      like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the
      whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the
      whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth
      while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious imaginary
      portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge
      the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the world right in this
      matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be
      found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever
      since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings
      of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups,
      and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin’s,
      and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever since then has something of
      the same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of
      the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to
      be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta,
      in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
      that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable
      avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came
      into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of
      whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred
      to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation
      of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.
      But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give
      the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It
      looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of
      the true whale’s majestic flukes.
    </p>
<p>
      But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter’s
      portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian
      Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the
      sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange
      creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own
      “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of
      that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one
      inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended
      tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the
      Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then,
      there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale,
      as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What
      shall be said of these? As for the book-binder’s whale winding like a
      vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor—as stamped and
      gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new—that
      is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it,
      from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a
      dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a
      whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It
      was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th
      century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down
      to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
      species of the Leviathan.
    </p>
<p>
      In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will
      at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of
      spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come
      bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original
      edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you will find some curious
      whales.
    </p>
<p>
      But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
      pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by
      those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some
      plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
      entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale,
      Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the whales,
      like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with
      white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the
      prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
      flukes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a
      Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round Cape Horn into
      the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale
      Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to be a “Picture of a
      Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast
      of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.” I doubt not the captain had
      this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention
      but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied,
      according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would
      make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my
      gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
    </p>
<p>
      Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the
      benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
      mistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In the
      abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged “whale”
       and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly
      whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one
      glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century such
      a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of
      schoolboys.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great
      naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
      several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these are
      not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale
      (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man
      as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.
    </p>
<p>
      But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
      reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron.
      In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what
      he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any
      Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket.
      In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a
      squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men
      seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he
      got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one
      of his authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort
      of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and
      saucers inform us.
    </p>
<p>
      As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the
      shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
      Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting
      on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their
      deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.
    </p>
<p>
      But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
      surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been
      taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing
      of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble
      animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though
      elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has
      never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in
      his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in
      unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like
      a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing
      eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so
      as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of
      the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale
      and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of
      those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship’s deck, such is then the
      outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise
      expression the devil himself could not catch.
    </p>
<p>
      But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,
      accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it
      is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton
      gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham’s
      skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his
      executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old
      gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal characteristics; yet
      nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan’s articulated
      bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale
      bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the
      insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This
      peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this
      book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in
      the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the
      human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers,
      the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently
      lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial
      covering. “However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said
      humorous Stubb one day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without
      mittens.”
     </p>
<p>
      For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
      conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which
      must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark
      much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable
      degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely
      what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can
      derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling
      yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove
      and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too
      fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes.
    </h2>
<p>
      In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted
      here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to
      be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny,
      Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.
    </p>
<p>
      I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
      Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous
      chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far better
      than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All Beale’s drawings
      of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of
      three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His
      frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to
      excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and
      life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.
      Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly
      engraved. That is not his fault though.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
      are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
      but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because
      it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive
      anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living
      hunters.
    </p>
<p>
      But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not
      the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be
      anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken
      from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the
      Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is
      depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the
      profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the
      terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially
      unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster’s spine; and
      standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you
      behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the
      whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of
      the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub
      floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons
      obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about
      the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black
      stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault
      might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that
      pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.
    </p>
<p>
      In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the
      barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy
      bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His
      jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a
      smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking
      in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs,
      shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale
      sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the
      thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of
      tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in
      the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.
      Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable
      artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping
      unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead
      whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from
      the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.
    </p>
<p>
      Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was
      either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously
      tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting
      action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you
      find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in
      that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way,
      pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France; where every
      sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings
      and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly
      unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of
      Garnery.
    </p>
<p>
      The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
      things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
      they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s
      experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
      Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
      finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale
      hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem
      entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as
      the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of
      effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a
      pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving
      us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate
      miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical
      engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the
      microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a
      shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals.
      I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a
      veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not
      to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a
      Greenland Justice of the Peace.
    </p>
<p>
      In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
      French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself “H.
      Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose,
      nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene
      among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a
      calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship,
      and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together
      in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with
      reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few
      aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different
      affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the
      Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of
      cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat,
      hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase
      to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use;
      three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden
      roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like
      a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling
      whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to
      windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains,
      seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.
    </h2>
<p>
      On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
      crippled beggar (or <i>kedger</i>, as the sailors say) holding a painted board
      before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There
      are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to
      contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is being crunched
      by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years, they tell me,
      has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that stump to an
      incredulous world. But the time of his justification has now come. His
      three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping, at any
      rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the
      western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a
      stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands
      ruefully contemplating his own amputation.
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
      Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes,
      graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks
      wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles,
      as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they
      elaborately carve out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean
      leisure. Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements,
      specially intended for the skrimshandering business. But, in general, they
      toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool
      of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a
      mariner’s fancy.
    </p>
<p>
      Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to
      that condition in which God placed him, <i>i.e.</i> what is called savagery. Your
      true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a
      savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready
      at any moment to rebel against him.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
      hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club
      or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is
      as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but
      a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of
      wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady
      application.
    </p>
<p>
      As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
      same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of his
      one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite
      as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the
      Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
      suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.
    </p>
<p>
      Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the
      noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of
      American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.
    </p>
<p>
      At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by
      the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy,
      the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom
      remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned
      churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks;
      but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes
      so labelled with “<i>Hands off!</i>” you cannot examine them closely enough to
      decide upon their merit.
    </p>
<p>
      In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
      cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
      you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan
      partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf
      of green surges.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually
      girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point
      of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined
      along the undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see
      these sights; and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight
      again, you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and
      longitude of your first stand-point, else so chance-like are such
      observations of the hills, that your precise, previous stand-point would
      require a laborious re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still
      remain incognita, though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old
      Figuera chronicled them.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
      great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as when
      long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in
      battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round
      and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first
      defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have
      boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far
      beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish.
    </p>
<p>
      With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
      spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see
      whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie
      encamped beyond my mortal sight!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 58. Brit.
    </h2>
<p>
      Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of
      brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely
      feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to
      be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.
    </p>
<p>
      On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the
      attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam
      through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous
      Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the
      water that escaped at the lip.
    </p>
<p>
      As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
      scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters
      swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them
      endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
    </p>
<p>
      *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does not
      bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being
      shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like
      appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in
      those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
    </p>
<p>
      But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
      reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they
      paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more
      like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great
      hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass
      on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking
      them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him,
      who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.
      And even when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very
      hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly
      be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that lives in a dog
      or a horse.
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep
      with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old
      naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their
      kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this
      may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the
      ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious
      kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect
      be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
    </p>
<p>
      But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
      have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling;
      though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that
      Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one
      superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all
      mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and
      hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters; though but a
      moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man may brag of his
      science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that science
      and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom,
      the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
      frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these
      very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea
      which aboriginally belongs to it.
    </p>
<p>
      The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
      vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
      That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of
      last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided; two
      thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
    </p>
<p>
      Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
      miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
      when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
      swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
      precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
    </p>
<p>
      But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is
      also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
      murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
      spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own
      cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and
      leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy,
      no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle
      steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
    </p>
<p>
      Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide
      under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden
      beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
      brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
      dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,
      the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each
      other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.
    </p>
<p>
      Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
      earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
      strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
      surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
      Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the
      half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst
      never return!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 59. Squid.
    </h2>
<p>
      Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
      way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her
      keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts
      mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And
      still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet
      would be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
      spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the
      long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across
      them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together
      as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a
      strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
    </p>
<p>
      In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
      higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
      our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a
      moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and
      silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
      thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
      more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the
      negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right
      ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”
     </p>
<p>
      Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
      bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the
      bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his
      orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated
      aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
      gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
      ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale
      he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him;
      whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the
      white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for
      lowering.
    </p>
<p>
      The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all swiftly
      pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars
      suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where
      it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all
      thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which
      the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass,
      furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, lay floating
      on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling
      and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any
      hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have; no
      conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on
      the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
    </p>
<p>
      As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
      gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
      exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than
      to have seen thee, thou white ghost!”
     </p>
<p>
      “What was it, Sir?” said Flask.
    </p>
<p>
      “The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and
      returned to their ports to tell of it.”
     </p>
<p>
      But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the
      rest as silently following.
    </p>
<p>
      Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
      the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so
      very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
      portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
      declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of
      them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
      form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his
      only food. For though other species of whales find their food above water,
      and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains
      his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference
      is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At
      times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the
      detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty
      and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms
      belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the
      sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to
      attack and tear it.
    </p>
<p>
      There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
      Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which
      the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some
      other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But much
      abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.
    </p>
<p>
      By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
      creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,
      to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,
      but only as the Anak of the tribe.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 60. The Line.
    </h2>
<p>
      With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
      for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I
      have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
    </p>
<p>
      The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
      vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
      ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to
      the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
      sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too
      much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be
      subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no
      means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however much it may give
      it compactness and gloss.
    </p>
<p>
      Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely
      superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable
      as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add
      (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more handsome and
      becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of
      Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.
    </p>
<p>
      The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight,
      you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one
      and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty
      pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three
      tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something over two
      hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away
      in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form
      one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded “sheaves,” or layers of
      concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the “heart,” or minute
      vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or
      kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm,
      leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line
      in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this
      business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards
      through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it
      from all possible wrinkles and twists.
    </p>
<p>
      In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being
      continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because
      these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do
      not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in
      diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a
      craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of
      the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable
      distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one. When the
      painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub, the boat looks
      as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present
      to the whales.
    </p>
<p>
      Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
      eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub,
      and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This
      arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order
      to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring
      boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to
      carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these
      instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were,
      from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at
      hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for
      common safety’s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way
      attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the
      end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not
      stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him
      into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever
      find her again.
    </p>
<p>
      Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken
      aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried
      forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or
      handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing;
      and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite
      gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of
      the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill,
      prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight
      festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some
      ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the
      bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and
      is then attached to the short-warp—the rope which is immediately
      connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp
      goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
      twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen
      are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the
      landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes
      sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for
      the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while
      straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant
      the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in
      play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a
      shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a
      shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer
      sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never
      heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white
      cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the
      six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew
      pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may
      say.
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
      repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of
      this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
      For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like
      being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in
      full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.
      It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils,
      because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and
      the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain
      self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can
      you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing
      sun himself could never pierce you out.
    </p>
<p>
      Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies
      of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed,
      the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in
      itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the
      ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it
      silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual
      play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any
      other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live
      enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but
      it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals
      realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a
      philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel
      one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with
      a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.
    </h2>
<p>
      If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to
      Queequeg it was quite a different object.
    </p>
<p>
      “When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow
      of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”
     </p>
<p>
      The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to
      engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
      induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through
      which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground;
      that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,
      and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the
      Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
    </p>
<p>
      It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
      leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in
      what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that
      dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body;
      though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the
      power which first moved it is withdrawn.
    </p>
<p>
      Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen
      at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all
      three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we
      made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves,
      too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea,
      east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
    </p>
<p>
      Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
      hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;
      with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty
      fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the
      capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,
      glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the
      trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet,
      the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
      afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some
      enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
      started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts
      of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted
      forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
      the sparkling brine into the air.
    </p>
<p>
      “Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
      dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
    </p>
<p>
      The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
      the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,
      but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam,
      that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders
      that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So
      seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but
      silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails
      being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster
      perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank
      out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
    </p>
<p>
      “There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
      Stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was
      granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale
      rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and much nearer
      to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the
      capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of
      his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.
      Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at
      his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he
      was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast
      which he brewed.*
    </p>
<p>
      *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
      entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though
      apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him.
      So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when
      going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part
      of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the
      lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said
      to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a
      sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
    </p>
<p>
      “Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time—but
      start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried Stubb,
      spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em the long
      and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start her, all;
      but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy, easy—only
      start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead
      perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s all. Start her!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
      war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
      involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which
      the eager Indian gave.
    </p>
<p>
      But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!
      Kee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
      like a pacing tiger in his cage.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful
      of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.
      Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men
      to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like
      desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard—“Stand
      up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon was hurled. “Stern all!”
       The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing
      along every one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant
      before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the
      loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen
      blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe.
      As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before
      reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of
      Stubb’s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas
      sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like
      holding an enemy’s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all
      the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
    </p>
<p>
      “Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated
      by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More
      turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now
      flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego
      here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering business truly
      in that rocking commotion.
    </p>
<p>
      *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated,
      that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line
      with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart
      for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.
    </p>
<p>
      From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of
      the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would
      have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the
      other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements
      at once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
      in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
      little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
      gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
      clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
      form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to
      bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed
      passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat
      slackened his flight.
    </p>
<p>
      “Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
      towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet
      the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly
      planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the
      flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of
      the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another
      fling.
    </p>
<p>
      The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
      hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled
      and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing
      upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every
      face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the
      while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle
      of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited
      headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line
      attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few rapid
      blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.
    </p>
<p>
      “Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
      relaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along
      the fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his
      long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and
      churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the
      whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he
      could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of
      the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that
      unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the monster horribly wallowed in
      his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so
      that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly
      to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the
      day.
    </p>
<p>
      And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;
      surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his
      spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush
      after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red
      wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping
      down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
    </p>
<p>
      “He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
      Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
      thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 62. The Dart.
    </h2>
<p>
      A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
    </p>
<p>
      According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
      off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
      steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar,
      the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to
      strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long
      dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or
      thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the
      harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed,
      he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not
      only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;
      and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass, while all the
      other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know
      but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work
      very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling
      state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted
      harpooneer hears the exciting cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He
      now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way,
      seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may
      remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking
      the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for
      a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless
      harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them
      actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm
      whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many
      ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer
      that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
      you expect to find it there when most wanted!
    </p>
<p>
      Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
      that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
      likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
      themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the
      headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper station
      in the bows of the boat.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish
      and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last;
      he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever
      should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious to any
      fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed
      in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one
      nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the
      fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as
      the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.
    </p>
<p>
      To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
      world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of
      toil.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.
    </h2>
<p>
      Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in
      productive subjects, grow the chapters.
    </p>
<p>
      The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It
      is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is
      perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the
      purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon,
      whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby
      the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as
      readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It
      is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively
      called the first and second irons.
    </p>
<p>
      But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the
      line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly
      after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one
      should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of
      the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous,
      violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it
      becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his
      movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second
      iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence
      that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,
      somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all
      hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare
      coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in
      most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always
      unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.
    </p>
<p>
      Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard,
      it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly
      curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting
      them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in
      general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly
      captured and a corpse.
    </p>
<p>
      Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one
      unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities
      in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an
      audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
      simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied
      with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be
      ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are
      faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several most
      important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.
    </h2>
<p>
      Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm;
      so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of
      towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our
      thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly
      toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it
      seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was
      hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the
      great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five
      laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of
      a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if
      laden with pig-lead in bulk.
    </p>
<p>
      Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s
      main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
      dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing
      the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it
      for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into
      the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.
    </p>
<p>
      Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced
      his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead,
      some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in
      him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet
      to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship,
      all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon
      you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all
      hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are
      being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.
      But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to
      be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the
      whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through
      the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the
      two—ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks,
      whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*
    </p>
<p>
      *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
      reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is
      by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
      relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
      flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so
      that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the
      chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small,
      strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight
      in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit
      management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass,
      so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow
      suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the
      smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes
      or lobes.
    </p>
<p>
      If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on
      deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual
      but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that
      the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the
      time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this
      liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high
      liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish
      thing to his palate.
    </p>
<p>
      “A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me
      one from his small!”
     </p>
<p>
      Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
      thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
      the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of
      the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have
      a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by
      Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
    </p>
<p>
      About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns
      of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the
      capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only
      banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his
      own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the
      dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below
      in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails
      against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers’ hearts. Peering
      over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing
      in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they
      scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human
      head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at
      such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such
      symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all
      things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the
      hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.
    </p>
<p>
      Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
      will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs
      round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
      killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers
      over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s live meat
      with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their
      jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the
      dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it
      would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking
      sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the
      invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic,
      systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be
      carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or
      two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms,
      places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most
      hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you
      will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial
      spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at
      sea. If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about
      the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the
      devil.
    </p>
<p>
      But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going
      on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own
      epicurean lips.
    </p>
<p>
      “Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening
      his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
      and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with
      his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”
     </p>
<p>
      The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously roused
      from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along
      from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter
      with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other
      pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping
      along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion,
      were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and
      in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on the opposite
      side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and
      resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further
      over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his
      best ear into play.
    </p>
<p>
      “Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth,
      “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been beating this
      steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say that to be good,
      a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks now over the side,
      don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are
      kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em they are welcome to help
      themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must keep quiet. Blast me,
      if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and deliver my message. Here, take
      this lantern,” snatching one from his sideboard; “now then, go and preach
      to ’em!”
     </p>
<p>
      Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to
      the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea,
      so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand he
      solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling
      voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind,
      overheard all that was said.
    </p>
<p>
      “Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise
      dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say dat you
      can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must stop
      dat dam racket!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap on
      the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way
      when you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, cook; go on, go on.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—
    </p>
<p>
      “Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and
      Fleece continued.
    </p>
<p>
      “Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
      fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de
      tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and
      bitin’ dare?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk to
      ’em gentlemanly.”
     </p>
<p>
      Once more the sermon proceeded.
    </p>
<p>
      “Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for;
      dat is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
      de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den
      you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well goberned.
      Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a helping yourselbs
      from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de blubber out your neighbour’s
      mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale? And, by Gor, none
      on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale belong to some one else. I
      know some o’ you has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig
      mouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not
      to swaller wid, but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat
      can’t get into de scrouge to help demselves.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’ each
      oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to such dam
      g’uttons as you call ’em, till dare bellies is full, and dare bellies is
      bottomless; and when dey do get ’em full, dey wont hear you den; for den
      dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and can’t hear not’ing
      at all, no more, for eber and eber.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
      Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”
     </p>
<p>
      Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
      shrill voice, and cried—
    </p>
<p>
      “Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
      your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand just
      where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
      attention.”
     </p>
<p>
      “All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
      desired position.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go back
      to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you, cook?”
     </p>
<p>
      “What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.
    </p>
<p>
      “Silence! How old are you, cook?”
     </p>
<p>
      “’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.
    </p>
<p>
      “And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and
      don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another
      mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
      question. “Where were you born, cook?”
     </p>
<p>
      “’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what country
      you were born in, cook!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You
      must go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a
      whale-steak yet.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning round
      to depart.
    </p>
<p>
      “Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take
      that bit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it
      should be? Take it, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take
      it, and taste it.”
     </p>
<p>
      Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
      muttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the
      church?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.
    </p>
<p>
      “And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where
      you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his
      beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell
      me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb. “Where do you
      expect to go to, cook?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
    </p>
<p>
      “Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question. Now
      what’s your answer?”
     </p>
<p>
      “When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his whole
      air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed angel
      will come and fetch him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch
      him where?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
      keeping it there very solemnly.
    </p>
<p>
      “So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you
      are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?
      Main-top, eh?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.
    </p>
<p>
      “You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where your
      tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling
      through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t get there,
      except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a ticklish
      business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us are in
      heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye hear? Hold
      your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart, when I’m
      giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s your
      gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it
      there now, and pay attention.”
     </p>
<p>
      “All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
      vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one
      and the same time.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that
      I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don’t you?
      Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my private
      table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by
      overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the
      other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we are
      cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins;
      have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused,
      cook. There, now ye may go.”
     </p>
<p>
      But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
    </p>
<p>
      “Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D’ye
      hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you go.—Avast
      heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if he
      ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man,
      limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.
    </h2>
<p>
      That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
      like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
      outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
      philosophy of it.
    </p>
<p>
      It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale
      was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there.
      Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a
      handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with
      barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale.
      Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The meat is
      made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned
      and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of
      Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from
      the crown.
    </p>
<p>
      The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands
      be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you
      come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes
      away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays
      partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all
      know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old
      train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips
      of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And
      this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally
      left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that these men actually lived
      for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left
      ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps
      are called “fritters”; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown
      and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives’
      dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that
      the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.
    </p>
<p>
      But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
      exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
      delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the
      buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
      pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is;
      like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third
      month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter.
      Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other
      substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches of the night
      it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the
      huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I
      thus made.
    </p>
<p>
      In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.
      The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,
      whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),
      they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in
      flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is quite a dish among some
      epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by
      continually dining upon calves’ brains, by and by get to have a little
      brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf’s head from their own
      heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the
      reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf’s head before
      him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a
      sort of reproachfully at him, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous
      that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that
      appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned:
      <i>i.e.</i> that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it
      too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox
      was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on
      his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved
      it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see
      the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds.
      Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who
      is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that
      salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
      will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of
      judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest
      geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
      paté-de-foie-gras.
    </p>
<p>
      But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding
      insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized
      and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is that handle
      made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are
      eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat
      goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did the
      Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders
      formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or two
      that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.
    </h2>
<p>
      When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary
      toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at
      least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For
      that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed;
      and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to
      take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send every one below to
      his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time,
      anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each
      couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes
      well.
    </p>
<p>
      But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not
      answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the
      moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch,
      little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other
      parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound,
      their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by
      vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure
      notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to tickle them into
      still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the
      Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights,
      to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the
      whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
      concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on
      deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately
      suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns,
      so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two
      mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant
      murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep into their
      skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of
      their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their
      mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of
      the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other’s disembowelments,
      but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails
      seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be oppositely
      voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with
      the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or
      Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after
      what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted
      on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor
      Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his
      murderous jaw.
    </p>
<p>
      *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is
      about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,
      corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
      sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the
      lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when being
      used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a stiff
      pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.
    </p>
<p>
      “Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage, agonizingly
      lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de
      god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.
    </h2>
<p>
      It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
      professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
      turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have
      thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
      things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which
      no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was swayed
      up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest
      point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope
      winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and
      the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this
      block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was
      attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,
      the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body
      for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.
      This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is
      inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now
      commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the
      entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the
      nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and
      nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to
      the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a
      helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is
      heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the
      whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the
      disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the
      blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it
      stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by
      spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass
      continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the
      blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the
      “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the
      mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very
      act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till
      its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease
      heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways
      to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take
      good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch
      him headlong overboard.
    </p>
<p>
      One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
      called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out
      a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole,
      the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to
      retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows.
      Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off,
      once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong,
      desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while
      the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a
      blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers
      forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and
      hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened
      away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right
      beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this
      twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
      blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And
      thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering
      simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the
      blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining,
      and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general
      friction.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.
    </h2>
<p>
      I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of
      the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen
      afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains
      unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know
      what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm,
      close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from
      eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature’s
      skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of
      fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot
      raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale’s body but that same
      blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably
      dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of
      the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin,
      transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of
      isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is,
      previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but
      becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I
      use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and
      being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with
      fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to
      read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I
      am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass
      substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so
      much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin,
      so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of
      the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
      new-born child. But no more of this.
    </p>
<p>
      Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as
      in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
      hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or
      rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths,
      and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of
      the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere
      integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to
      the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of
      the stuff of the whale’s skin.
    </p>
<p>
      In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the
      many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely
      crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
      something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these
      marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
      mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon
      the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,
      observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford
      the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is,
      if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
      hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present
      connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm
      Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old
      Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the
      banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the
      mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian
      rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which
      the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back,
      and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular
      linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an
      irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the
      sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping
      contact with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks
      must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also
      seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile
      contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,
      full-grown bulls of the species.
    </p>
<p>
      A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
      whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
      pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy
      and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a
      real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over
      his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy
      blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself
      comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would
      become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the
      North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found
      exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed,
      are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are
      refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an
      iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas,
      like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he
      dies. How wonderful is it then—except after explanation—that
      this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is
      to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his
      lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard,
      they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into
      the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more
      surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood
      of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.
    </p>
<p>
      It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
      individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
      virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after
      the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this
      world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at
      the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and like the great whale,
      retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.
    </p>
<p>
      But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
      how few are domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few vast as the
      whale!

      CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.
    </h2>
<p>
      “Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”
    </p>
<p>
      The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
      beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it
      has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it
      floats more and more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the
      insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of
      screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the
      whale. The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the
      ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks
      and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and hours
      from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the
      unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
      wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and on,
      till lost in infinite perspectives.
    </p>
<p>
      There’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in
      pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In
      life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure
      he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do
      pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest
      whale is free.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives
      and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering
      discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming
      fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and
      the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the whale’s unharming
      corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log—<i>shoals, rocks,
      and breakers hereabouts: beware!</i> And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships
      shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because
      their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There’s your
      law of precedents; there’s your utility of traditions; there’s the story
      of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and
      now not even hovering in the air! There’s orthodoxy!
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror to
      his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world.
    </p>
<p>
      Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than the
      Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.
    </h2>
<p>
      It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the
      body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the Sperm
      Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale
      surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.
    </p>
<p>
      Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on
      the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very
      place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must
      operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his
      subject, and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and
      oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under
      these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh;
      and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single
      peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer
      clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at
      a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not marvel,
      then, at Stubb’s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm
      whale?
    </p>
<p>
      When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
      till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is
      hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown
      leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head embraces nearly
      one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as
      that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing
      as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’ scales.
    </p>
<p>
      The Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was
      hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so
      that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And
      there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the
      enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on
      that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
      blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the giant Holofernes’s
      from the girdle of Judith.
    </p>
<p>
      When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
      below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now
      deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was
      more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from
      his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over
      the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb’s long
      spade—still remaining there after the whale’s decapitation—and
      striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass, placed its
      other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes
      attentively fixed on this head.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
      intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast
      and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a
      beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head,
      and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast
      dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has
      moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies
      rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this
      frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there,
      in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been
      where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor’s side, where
      sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw’st the
      locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they
      sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed
      false to them. Thou saw’st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from
      the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the
      insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed—while
      swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a
      righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen
      enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one
      syllable is thine!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself,
      while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That lively cry
      upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.—Where
      away?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to
      us!
    </p>
<p>
      “Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way, and
      to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man! how
      far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom
      stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.
    </h2>
<p>
      Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the
      ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
    </p>
<p>
      By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads
      proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting
      by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not
      hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be
      made.
    </p>
<p>
      Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of
      the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals
      being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
      attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders
      are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable
      distances and with no small facility.
    </p>
<p>
      The Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting her
      own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her
      yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee, and lowered a
      boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by
      Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in
      question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token of that proceeding
      being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a
      malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of
      infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though himself and boat’s crew
      remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an
      incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously
      adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to
      come into direct contact with the Pequod.
    </p>
<p>
      But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
      interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s
      boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the
      Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew
      very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the
      sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way
      ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again.
      Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a
      conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not
      without still another interruption of a very different sort.
    </p>
<p>
      Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular appearance,
      even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all
      totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his
      face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted,
      cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him; the
      overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep,
      settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed—“That’s
      he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho’s company told
      us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a
      certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the
      Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently learned, it
      seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency
      over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:
    </p>
<p>
      He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
      Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
      meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
      trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
      carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,
      was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having
      seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning
      peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and
      offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam’s whaling
      voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship’s getting out of
      sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself
      as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He
      published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of
      the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching
      earnestness with which he declared these things;—the dark, daring
      play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural
      terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of
      the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness.
      Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much
      practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
      pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but
      apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first
      convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials—devoting
      the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention
      was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the
      crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if
      Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was
      therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to
      be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass
      that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all
      this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
      mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand
      than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole
      command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The
      sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him;
      in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage,
      as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they
      are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to
      the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless
      power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
      return to the Pequod.
    </p>
<p>
      “I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
      Mayhew, who stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”
     </p>
<p>
      But now Gabriel started to his feet.
    </p>
<p>
      “Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
      plague!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But
      that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
      drowned all speech.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
      back.
    </p>
<p>
      “Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible
      tail!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as
      if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a
      succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
      caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted
      sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen
      eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature
      seemed to warrant.
    </p>
<p>
      When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning
      Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel,
      whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued
      with him.
    </p>
<p>
      It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a
      whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby
      Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,
      Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in
      case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing
      the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the
      Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby
      Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned
      with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling
      to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations
      and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
      With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous,
      unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast.
      Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one
      arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to
      the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate,
      was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his
      tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to
      get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from
      the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out
      of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of
      furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in
      his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a
      chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the
      mate for ever sank.
    </p>
<p>
      It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
      Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
      Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener
      the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the headsman
      stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But strangest of
      all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the body
      has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is discernible; the man
      being stark dead.
    </p>
<p>
      The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried
      from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”
       Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of
      the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;
      because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically
      fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any
      one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
      wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
      that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended
      to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab
      answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his
      feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward
      pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down
      there!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”
     </p>
<p>
      Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just
      bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers,
      if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”
     </p>
<p>
      Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
      whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon
      the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most
      letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after attaining
      an age of two or three years or more.
    </p>
<p>
      Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,
      damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of
      being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself
      might well have been the post-boy.
    </p>
<p>
      “Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but a
      dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
      long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
      insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without its
      coming any closer to the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a
      woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr.
      Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let me
      have it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going that
      way.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
      receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he caught
      it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as
      he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted
      a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter
      suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He clutched it in an
      instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it
      thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s feet. Then Gabriel
      shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that
      manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    </p>
<p>
      As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of
      the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
      affair.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
    </h2>
<p>
      In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there
      is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are
      wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in
      any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done
      everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of
      the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that
      upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the blubber-hook was
      inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But
      how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that
      hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty
      it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster’s back for the special
      purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that
      the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or
      stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost
      entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down
      there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer
      flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass
      revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,
      Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in
      which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one
      had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in
      his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend
      upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale’s
      back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long
      cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there
      in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope,
      attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
      proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both
      ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather
      one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded;
      and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor
      demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his
      wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my
      own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous
      liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    </p>
<p>
      So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that
      while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that
      my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that
      my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another’s mistake or
      misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death.
      Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for
      its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet
      still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between
      the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further
      pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise
      situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way
      or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If
      your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you
      poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding
      caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil
      chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s monkey-rope heedfully as I would,
      sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor
      could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management
      of one end of it.*
    </p>
<p>
      *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
      that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement
      upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in
      order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee
      for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.
    </p>
<p>
      I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale
      and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
      rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he
      was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
      night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
      blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures
      swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    </p>
<p>
      And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside
      with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that
      attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously
      carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous
      finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.
      Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the
      poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a
      peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another
      protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and
      Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades,
      wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This
      procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of
      them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty
      zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the
      sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those
      indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a
      tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that
      great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo,
      and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and
      then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it,
      after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in
      this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
      sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and
      spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    </p>
<p>
      But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as
      with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up
      the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the
      side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance
      hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a
      cup of tepid ginger and water!
    </p>
<p>
      “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes,
      this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing
      as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished
      steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to
      tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger
      the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering
      cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer
      matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I
      say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.”
     </p>
<p>
      “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,”
       he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from
      forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you
      please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr.
      Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there,
      this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I
      ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life
      into a half-drowned man?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a harpooneer;
      none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You
      have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket
      the proceeds, do ye?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the
      ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but
      only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the
      lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It
      is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
      that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
     </p>
<p>
      When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort
      of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was
      handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that was
      freely given to the waves.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.
    </h2>
<p>
      It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s
      prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it continue
      hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the
      present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is
      to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted
      into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual
      tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that
      but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And
      though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior
      creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them
      at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts
      without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought
      alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made
      that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
      boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and
      further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the
      mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
      tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
      both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
      plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
      towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it
      seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom,
      within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if
      diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats,
      which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly
      dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs,
      and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope,
      and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the
      ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while
      they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still
      plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them
      under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they
      stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt
      running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping
      beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and
      quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like
      bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to
      sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale
      abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of
      the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete
      circuit.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking
      him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus
      round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks
      that had before swum round the Sperm Whale’s body, rushed to the fresh
      blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager
      Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten
      rock.
    </p>
<p>
      At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
      turned upon his back a corpse.
    </p>
<p>
      While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
      and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
      conversation ensued between them.
    </p>
<p>
      “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb,
      not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a
      leviathan.
    </p>
<p>
      “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow,
      “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s head
      hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale’s on the
      larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards
      capsize?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why not?
    </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and
      he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think he’ll
      charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap, Stubb. Did
      you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake’s
      head, Stubb?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
      dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down
      there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
      hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
      disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
      stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you don’t
      see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled
      away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he’s
      always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve
      seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
      see, in the eye of the rigging.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Bargain?—about what?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the
      devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his
      silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he’ll
      surrender Moby Dick.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I
      tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship
      once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and
      inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked
      the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, ‘I
      want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old governor. ‘What business is that of
      yours,’ says the devil, getting mad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take
      him,’ says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn’t
      give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I’ll eat
      this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain’t you all ready
      there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get the whale alongside.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when
      at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the
      ship, “but I can’t remember where.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye
      read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb,
      do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same
      you say is now on board the Pequod?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live for
      ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson
      a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get
      into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole?
      Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
     </p>
<p>
      “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s the
      figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold, and string along
      in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn’t begin
      to be Fedallah’s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn’t show hoops
      enough to make oughts enough.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you
      meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he’s
      so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for
      ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that?
    </p>
<p>
      “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But he’d crawl back.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes,
      and drown you—what then?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black eyes
      that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin again for a
      long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and
      hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil,
      Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s afraid of him, except
      the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as
      he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a
      bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he’d roast for
      him? There’s a governor!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to
      keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going
      on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here,
      Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I’ll
      make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give
      him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the
      stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself
      docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the poor
      satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
     </p>
<p>
      The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where
      fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.
    </p>
<p>
      “Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right
      whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”
     </p>
<p>
      In good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
      leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of
      both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
      well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go over
      that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come back
      again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming
      boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then
      you will float light and right.
    </p>
<p>
      In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
      ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case
      of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole,
      but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted
      on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the
      crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done.
      The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship
      not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever and
      anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand.
      And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while,
      if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and
      lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were
      bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
    </h2>
<p>
      Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join
      them, and lay together our own.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
      Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly
      hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all
      the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them
      is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment
      hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we may freely go from one to the
      other, by merely stepping across the deck:—where, I should like to
      know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than
      here?
    </p>
<p>
      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these
      heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain
      mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right Whale’s sadly
      lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head. As you behold
      it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of
      pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is
      heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving
      token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the
      fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”
     </p>
<p>
      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the
      two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of
      the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you
      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
      fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
      magnitude of the head.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is plain
      that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he
      can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s eyes
      corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how
      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.
      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision
      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more
      behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with
      dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more
      than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have
      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
      fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man—what, indeed,
      but his eyes?
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
      are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
      produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the
      whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid
      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes
      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which
      each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one
      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;
      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man
      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with
      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are
      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the
      view. This peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne
      in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some
      subsequent scenes.
    </p>
<p>
      A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
      visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
      hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is
      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever
      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience will teach him,
      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one
      glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to
      examine any two things—however large or however small—at one
      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and
      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and
      surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one
      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other
      will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,
      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must
      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
      combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the same moment of time
      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and
      the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as
      marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go
      through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor,
      strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
      extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset
      by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so
      common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the
      helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically
      opposite powers of vision must involve them.
    </p>
<p>
      But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
      entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
      hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
      whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
      wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
      respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between
      the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has an external
      opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a
      membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world
      through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is
      smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of
      Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
      cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
      hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
      Subtilize it.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
      over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by
      a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that
      the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might
      descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us
      hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What a really
      beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or
      rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.
    </p>
<p>
      But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like
      the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end,
      instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and
      expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas!
      it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall
      with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms
      down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with
      his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at
      right-angles with his body, for all the world like a ship’s jib-boom. This
      whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
      hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed,
      leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his
      tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.
    </p>
<p>
      In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised
      artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of
      extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white
      whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
      including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
    </p>
<p>
      With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
      anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other
      work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished
      dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg
      lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle
      being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
      stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two
      teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled
      after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and
      piled away like joists for building houses.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
    </h2>
<p>
      Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale’s
      head.
    </p>
<p>
      As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a
      Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);
      so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather inelegant
      resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old
      Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker’s last. And in this
      same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming
      brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.
    </p>
<p>
      But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
      aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and
      look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for
      an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its
      sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
      crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,
      barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the Southern
      fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this,
      you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird’s nest
      in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle
      here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;
      unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term “crown”
       also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
      thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea,
      whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner.
      But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a
      diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is
      there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long
      and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons
      of oil and more.
    </p>
<p>
      A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The
      fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important
      interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the
      beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide
      into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be
      the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah
      went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp
      angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,
      arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,
      scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which
      depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those
      Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges
      of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right
      Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
      fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time.
      In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there
      are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some
      whalemen calculate the creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its
      circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from
      demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate,
      if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than
      at first glance will seem reasonable.
    </p>
<p>
      In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
      concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
      “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
      third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
      “There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
      upper <i>chop</i>, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”
     </p>
<p>
      *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
      rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper
      part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a
      rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.
    </p>
<p>
      As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”
       “blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
      other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long
      been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was in its
      glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient
      dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say;
      even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly
      under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over
      the same bone.
    </p>
<p>
      But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
      in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these
      colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you
      were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand
      pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey—the
      tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very
      fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This
      particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a
      six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.
    </p>
<p>
      Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with—that
      the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads.
      To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no great well of sperm; no
      ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the
      Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of
      bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the
      Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
    </p>
<p>
      Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
      together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will
      not be very long in following.
    </p>
<p>
      Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same he
      died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded
      away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born
      of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head’s
      expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the
      vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head
      seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This
      Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who
      might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.
    </h2>
<p>
      Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you, as
      a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front
      aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate
      it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,
      intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there.
      Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle this
      matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most
      appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in
      all recorded history.
    </p>
<p>
      You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the
      front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water;
      you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
      backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
      receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely
      under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth
      were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no
      external nose; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on
      the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
      of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.
      Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale’s
      head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of
      any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the
      extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there
      the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from
      the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this
      whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon
      be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you
      are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably
      invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have
      described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind
      wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this difference: about
      the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness,
      inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed
      harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently
      rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were
      paved with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
    </p>
<p>
      Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
      chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
      sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
      contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there
      a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest
      of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have
      snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this
      sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to
      this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess
      what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of distension
      or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such
      provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in
      which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon
      swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed
      elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head;
      it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical
      lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
      unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
      atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the
      irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
      destructive of all elements contributes.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall,
      and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of
      tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by
      the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So
      that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and
      concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster;
      when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats; I
      trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to
      abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the
      Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not
      elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are
      but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing
      for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the
      provincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread
      goddess’s veil at Lais?

      CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
    </h2>
<p>
      Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
      know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
      upon.
    </p>
<p>
      Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
      inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is
      the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
      unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
      expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
      forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
      almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
      wall of a thick tendinous substance.
    </p>
<p>
      *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
      mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
      solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
      steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
      sides.
    </p>
<p>
      The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
      oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated
      cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The
      upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh
      Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically
      carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable
      strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun.
      Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most
      excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale
      contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the
      highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous
      state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
      the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
      exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
      forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is
      just forming in water. A large whale’s case generally yields about five
      hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,
      considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise
      irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.
    </p>
<p>
      I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
      coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly
      have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of
      a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale’s case.
    </p>
<p>
      It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
      embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as
      has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the
      whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
      for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
      of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship’s
      side.
    </p>
<p>
      As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought close
      to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
      magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
      untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
      invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
      is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the
      enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make
      quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in
      this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
      Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.
    </h2>
<p>
      Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
      posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part
      where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a
      light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling
      through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down
      from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and
      firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part,
      the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit
      of the head. There—still high elevated above the rest of the
      company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish Muezzin
      calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
      short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for
      the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he
      proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
      sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this
      cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a
      well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other
      end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert
      hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom
      another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into
      the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it
      entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up
      comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk.
      Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by
      an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting
      aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will
      yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder
      and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of
      the pole have gone down.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
      several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a
      queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,
      was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold
      on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place
      where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One
      himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular
      reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as
      the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up—my God! poor
      Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
      dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a
      horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!
    </p>
<p>
      “Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
      came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot into
      it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself,
      the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before
      Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a
      terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head
      throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment
      seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian
      unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he
      had sunk.
    </p>
<p>
      At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the
      whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a
      sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one
      of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast
      vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and
      shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the
      entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of
      giving way; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the
      head.
    </p>
<p>
      “Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
      holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would
      still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed
      down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried
      harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
    </p>
<p>
      “In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
      there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket
      on top of his head? Avast, will ye!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.
    </p>
<p>
      Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped
      into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly
      relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and
      all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the sailors’
      heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray,
      was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
      buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!
      But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked figure with
      a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over
      the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had
      dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and every eye
      counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the
      sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat
      alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
      overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
      upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
      forth from the grass over a grave.
    </p>
<p>
      “Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful
      shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one
      hand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into
      the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
      long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the
      slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges
      near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his
      sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out
      poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a
      leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be,
      and might occasion great trouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by
      a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so
      that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way—head
      foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could be
      expected.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,
      the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully
      accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
      hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
      Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,
      riding and rowing.
    </p>
<p>
      I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to seem
      incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen
      or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which
      not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian’s,
      considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale’s
      well.
    </p>
<p>
      But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
      the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
      most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a
      far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all,
      but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly
      emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous
      wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance, as I have
      before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in
      it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance
      was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of
      the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
      deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his
      agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running
      delivery, so it was.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
      perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
      spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and
      sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
      recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking
      honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it,
      that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How
      many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and sweetly
      perished there?

<h2>
      CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.
    </h2>
<p>
      To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
      Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as
      yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
      Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for
      Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon.
      Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the various
      faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of horses, birds,
      serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of
      expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim
      failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics
      of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a
      pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I
      will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.
    </p>
<p>
      Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
      has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous
      of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls
      their combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as
      an external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the
      whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower
      of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the
      scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated
      open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias’s marble Jove,
      and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a
      magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency
      which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.
      Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been
      impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head
      in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by
      the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
      so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
      royal beadle on his throne.
    </p>
<p>
      In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be
      had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect
      is sublime.
    </p>
<p>
      In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
      morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a
      touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the
      elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that
      great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees. It
      signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most creatures,
      nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land
      lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare’s
      or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves
      seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the
      forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending
      there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
      But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
      inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that
      full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly
      than in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one
      point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes,
      ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad
      firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the
      doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous
      brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon
      you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
      depression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark of
      genius.
    </p>
<p>
      But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
      book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing
      nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical
      silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to
      the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their child-magian
      thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is
      tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so
      exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any
      highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the
      merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now
      egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to
      Jove’s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.
    </p>
<p>
      Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no
      Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s face.
      Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If
      then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the
      simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how
      may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale’s
      brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 80. The Nut.
    </h2>
<p>
      If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his
      brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.
    </p>
<p>
      In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in
      length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the
      side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base.
      But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is
      angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
      mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
      bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in
      another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth—reposes
      the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at least twenty
      feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast
      outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications
      of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have
      known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any
      other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards
      of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions,
      to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his
      general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his
      intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the
      creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true
      brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale,
      like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.
    </p>
<p>
      If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of
      its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance
      to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point
      of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human
      magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would involuntarily
      confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on one part of its
      summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man had no
      self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations, considered along
      with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best
      form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception
      of what the most exalted potency is.
    </p>
<p>
      But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you
      deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
      for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you will
      be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung necklace of
      dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It
      is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls.
      But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the
      first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the
      skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebræ of which he was
      inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I
      consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not
      pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.
      For I believe that much of a man’s character will be found betokened in
      his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you
      are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I
      rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I
      fling half out to the world.
    </p>
<p>
      Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
      cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
      the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight
      in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it
      passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but for a
      considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this
      canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the
      spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain.
      And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s
      cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to
      that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable
      to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in
      this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is
      more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal
      cord.
    </p>
<p>
      But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would
      merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm
      Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the
      larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould
      of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the
      organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the
      great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
    </h2>
<p>
      The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick
      De Deer, master, of Bremen.
    </p>
<p>
      At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
      Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals
      of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in
      the Pacific.
    </p>
<p>
      For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
      While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
      boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
      bows instead of the stern.
    </p>
<p>
      “What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
      wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s
      coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big
      tin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s
      all right, is the Yarman.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He’s
      out of oil, and has come a-begging.”
     </p>
<p>
      However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
      whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
      proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
      really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
      indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
    </p>
<p>
      As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding
      what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced
      his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the
      conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching
      his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness—his
      last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet
      captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was
      indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a <i>clean</i> one (that is, an
      empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
    </p>
<p>
      His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
      ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
      mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
      without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round
      his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats
      that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod’s keels.
      There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were
      going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their
      flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a
      great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment
      upon the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped
      old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the
      unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the
      jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod
      in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such
      venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their
      wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the
      white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell
      formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and
      laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself
      in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
      seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters
      behind him to upbubble.
    </p>
<p>
      “Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
      afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds
      are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind I ever
      knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must
      be, he’s lost his tiller.”
     </p>
<p>
      As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load
      of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so
      did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning
      over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the
      unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in
      battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
    </p>
<p>
      “Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded
      arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the
      German will have him.”
     </p>
<p>
      With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
      fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable
      whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with
      such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At
      this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three German boats last
      lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick’s boat still led the
      chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing
      they feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be
      enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass
      him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case,
      and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
      other boats.
    </p>
<p>
      “The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and dares
      me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!”—then
      in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s
      against my religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous Yarman—Pull—won’t
      ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead
      of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don’t some of ye burst a
      blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an anchor overboard—we don’t
      budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s grass growing in the
      boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s budding. This won’t
      do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will ye
      spit fire or not?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What
      a hump—Oh, <i>do</i> pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads,
      <i>do</i> spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked
      clams and muffins—oh, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i>, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t
      lose him now—don’t oh, <i>don’t!</i>—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t
      ye pull for your duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye
      love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a
      whole bank! The bank of England!—Oh, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>do!</i>—What’s that
      Yarman about now?”
     </p>
<p>
      At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
      advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
      retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically accelerating
      his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
    </p>
<p>
      “The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty
      thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,
      Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for
      the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.
    </p>
<p>
      Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s
      three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
      momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
      headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly,
      occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, “There
      she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman!
      Sail over him!”
     </p>
<p>
      But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their
      gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a
      righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of
      his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his
      white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh to capsizing,
      and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that was a good
      time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal
      start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s quarter. An
      instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale’s
      immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming
      swell that he made.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now
      going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented
      jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to
      this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at
      every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways
      rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with
      clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving
      to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with
      plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb
      brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice,
      save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the
      sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk,
      portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the
      stoutest man who so pitied.
    </p>
<p>
      Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s boats
      the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to
      hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the
      last chance would for ever escape.
    </p>
<p>
      But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
      tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to
      their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
      barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
      Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
      white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong
      rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and his
      baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying
      keels.
    </p>
<p>
      “Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing glance
      upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all right—I
      saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
      distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a
      sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
      mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury
      on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him
      that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a
      hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going to Davy Jones—all
      a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the
      everlasting mail!”
     </p>
<p>
      But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
      tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the
      loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so
      fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust
      the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated
      smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last—owing to the
      perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the
      three ropes went straight down into the blue—the gunwales of the
      bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high
      in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they
      remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the
      position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and
      lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as it is called; this
      hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is
      that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp
      lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
      doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable
      to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more
      he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him—in a
      full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet—the
      pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing
      atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground,
      in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a
      column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight
      of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of
      twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
      board.
    </p>
<p>
      As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into
      its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay,
      not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman
      would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the
      utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight
      inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible
      that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the
      big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of
      board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said—“Canst
      thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The
      sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the
      habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee;
      darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This
      the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets.
      For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run
      his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s
      fish-spears!
    </p>
<p>
      In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent
      down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to
      shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale
      must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
    </p>
<p>
      “Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
      vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
      magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
      oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
      from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
      upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
      scared from it into the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      “Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”
     </p>
<p>
      The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
      could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
      dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship’s
      lengths of the hunters.
    </p>
<p>
      His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals
      there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby
      when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
      certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it
      is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that
      when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at
      once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by
      the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface,
      his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is
      the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
      fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable
      period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the
      well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats
      pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and
      the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from
      the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
      spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its
      affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,
      because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they
      significantly call it, was untouched.
    </p>
<p>
      As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his
      form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.
      His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As
      strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when
      prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes had once occupied,
      now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was
      none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must
      die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other
      merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that
      preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his
      blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or
      protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.
    </p>
<p>
      “A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”
     </p>
<p>
      But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous
      jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable
      anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly
      darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over
      with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring the bows. It was
      his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood,
      that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on
      his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over
      slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his
      belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring
      spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
      mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
      spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying
      spout of the whale.
    </p>
<p>
      Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
      showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,
      by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
      that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a
      few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the
      ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly
      secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless
      artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.
    </p>
<p>
      It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the
      entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on
      the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of
      harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with
      the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to
      denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other
      unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration
      alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone
      being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm
      about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been
      darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before America was discovered.
    </p>
<p>
      What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet
      there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by
      the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing
      to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck,
      who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it
      so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been
      capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when
      the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
      strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were
      fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in
      the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like
      walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.
      Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from
      their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows
      were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift
      from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the
      submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole
      tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed
      on the point of going over.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in such a
      devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for
      it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of
      ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy
      hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at
      the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given,
      when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every
      fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale
      is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted
      for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its
      side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales
      that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads
      of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might
      with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon
      specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of
      buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest
      health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the
      warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
      these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
    </p>
<p>
      Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
      accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
      Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
      no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his
      Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
      incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where,
      after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again
      rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases
      are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort
      of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.
      In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a
      Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
      of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for
      it when it shall have ascended again.
    </p>
<p>
      It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
      the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering
      her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,
      belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible
      power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is so similar to the
      Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.
      And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this
      unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young
      keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold,
      hopeful chase.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.
    </h2>
<p>
      There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
      method.
    </p>
<p>
      The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to
      the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great
      honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great
      demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have
      shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I
      myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.
    </p>
<p>
      The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the
      eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by
      our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the
      knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the
      distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine
      story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of
      a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the
      very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly
      advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It
      was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers
      of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first
      dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa,
      now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood
      for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and
      all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that
      Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to
      Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in
      this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
    </p>
<p>
      Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some
      supposed to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of
      St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale;
      for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled
      together, and often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the
      waters, and as a dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly
      meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word
      itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had
      St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of
      doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake,
      but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to
      march boldly up to a whale.
    </p>
<p>
      Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
      creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
      represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on
      land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of
      those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists; and
      considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have
      crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
      ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
      bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with
      the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this
      so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,
      placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare
      like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name;
      who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s head and both the
      palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of
      him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is
      the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of
      Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And
      therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I
      venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron),
      let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen
      frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George’s
      decoration than they.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained
      dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique
      Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds,
      was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly
      makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he
      ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.
      Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate
      the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of our
      clan.
    </p>
<p>
      But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules
      and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient
      Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly they are
      very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet?
    </p>
<p>
      Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
      roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal
      kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
      short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to
      be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of
      the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine
      Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
      earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.
      When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate
      the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to
      Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose
      perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning
      the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the
      shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at
      the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and
      sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.
      Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is
      called a horseman?
    </p>
<p>
      Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a member-roll
      for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like that?

<h2>
      CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
    </h2>
<p>
      Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the
      preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical
      story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks
      and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,
      equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the
      dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
      traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
    </p>
<p>
      One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
      story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
      embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
      Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true
      with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
      varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying,
      “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small. But, to
      this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,
      hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly,
      but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems
      reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth
      would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
      players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow
      tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.
    </p>
<p>
      Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want
      of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
      reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But
      this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
      supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a <i>dead</i>
      whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
      their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been
      divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown
      overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to
      another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I
      would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays
      christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been
      wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the
      book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which
      the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor
      Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another
      reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was
      swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he
      was vomited up somewhere within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on
      the Tigris, very much more than three days’ journey across from the
      nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?
    </p>
<p>
      But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
      short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way
      of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the
      whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf
      and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete
      circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris
      waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim
      in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so
      early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland
      from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history
      a liar.
    </p>
<p>
      But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish
      pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that
      he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and
      the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable,
      devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese
      Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh via the Cape
      of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general
      miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks
      devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three
      centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s Voyages, speaks of a
      Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous
      lamp that burnt without any oil.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.
    </h2>
<p>
      To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed;
      and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation
      upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as
      such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible
      advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a
      sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide
      bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning
      not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than
      customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it
      hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently
      seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to
      be working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain
      unwarranted by the event.
    </p>
<p>
      Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
      them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,
      as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great
      exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
      stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
      flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
      planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
      imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to
      haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.
      What then remained?
    </p>
<p>
      Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
      countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
      none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
      sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is
      only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and
      feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately
      darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.
      Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in
      length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a
      lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a
      warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand
      after darting.
    </p>
<p>
      But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the
      harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom
      done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of
      the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the
      lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing,
      therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling
      comes into play.
    </p>
<p>
      Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
      equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in
      pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
      flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.
      Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length
      to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of
      the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving
      the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband’s
      middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily
      depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the
      weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He
      minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next
      moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright
      steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the
      whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
    </p>
<p>
      “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal
      Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans
      whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad,
      I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink round it! Yea,
      verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the spread of his
      spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.”
     </p>
<p>
      Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the
      spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The
      agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the
      pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the
      monster die.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
    </h2>
<p>
      That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of
      ages before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the
      sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so
      many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
      thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale,
      watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should be,
      and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes
      past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it
      should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all,
      really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy
      thing.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
      contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,
      the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined
      with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live
      a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to
      his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human
      being’s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the
      open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the
      upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,
      in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight
      feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
      connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and
      this is on the top of his head.
    </p>
<p>
      If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable
      to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element,
      which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to
      the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I
      may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it
      follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,
      he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a
      considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.
      Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who
      systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the
      bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling
      a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between
      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when
      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So
      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a
      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless
      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and
      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in <i>having his spoutings out</i>, as
      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising
      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time
      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven
      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then
      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over
      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his
      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,
      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,
      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one
      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere
      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
      whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not
      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a
      thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O
      hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
    </p>
<p>
      In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving
      for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
      Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
    </p>
<p>
      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if
      it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I
      opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems
      obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to
      his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two
      elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But
      owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it
      be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this
      head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
      olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no
      Cologne-water in the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
      canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is
      furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
      retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has
      no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely
      rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to
      say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to
      this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
      living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for
      the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just
      beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this
      curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side
      of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a
      water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the
      mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed
      with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It
      is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;
      but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
      through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would
      seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm
      Whale’s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if
      he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme
      between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
    </p>
<p>
      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You
      have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell
      water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle
      these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of
      all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be
      undecided as to what it is precisely.
    </p>
<p>
      The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
      it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when,
      always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his
      spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around
      him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops
      of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely
      condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those
      identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is
      countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For even when tranquilly
      swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump
      sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then, the whale always
      carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you
      will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
      precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
      into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
      this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
      slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often
      happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing
      so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with
      the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I
      cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among
      whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another
      thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet
      is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the
      investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout
      alone.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
      hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other
      reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the
      great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no
      common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is
      never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.
      He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads
      of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil,
      Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible
      steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a
      little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before
      me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and
      undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my
      hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
      shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for
      the above supposition.
    </p>
<p>
      And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
      behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
      head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
      contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified
      by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For,
      d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor.
      And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine
      intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And
      for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or
      denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things
      earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes
      neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with
      equal eye.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 86. The Tail.
    </h2>
<p>
      Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and
      the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I
      celebrate a tail.
    </p>
<p>
      Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point of
      the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon
      its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The
      compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or
      flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the
      crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede
      from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living
      thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the
      crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full
      grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.
    </p>
<p>
      The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into
      it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,
      middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and
      horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise
      between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything
      else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the
      middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles
      always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the
      antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of
      the masonry.
    </p>
<p>
      But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the
      whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular
      fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running
      down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute
      to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the
      whole whale seems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to
      matter, this were the thing to do it.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the
      graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates
      through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their
      most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or
      harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,
      strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that
      all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its
      charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the
      naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
      man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God
      the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they
      may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
      hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
      successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all
      brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one
      of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the
      peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.
    </p>
<p>
      Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
      wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be
      in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no
      fairy’s arm can transcend it.
    </p>
<p>
      Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
      progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
      Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
    </p>
<p>
      First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a
      different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
      wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
      whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
      forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this
      which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when
      furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.
    </p>
<p>
      Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights
      another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts
      with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a
      boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only
      inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially
      if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs
      of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it;
      but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly owing to
      the light buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials,
      a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is
      generally the most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often
      received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some
      one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the
      sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a
      delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant’s trunk.
      This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in
      maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his
      immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he
      feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all. What
      tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail any
      prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes’ elephant
      that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations presented
      nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On more accounts than
      one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue
      in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded
      in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.
    </p>
<p>
      Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
      middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of
      his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
      hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his
      tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
      thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great
      gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor
      from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was
      the smoke from the touch-hole.
    </p>
<p>
      Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie
      considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of
      sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps,
      his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect
      in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot
      out of view. Excepting the sublime <i>breach</i>—somewhere else to be
      described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the grandest
      sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
      profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
      highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth
      his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing
      at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean,
      the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.
      Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky
      and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading
      towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.
      As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of
      the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire
      worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I
      then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all
      beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity
      often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest
      silence.
    </p>
<p>
      The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant,
      so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other
      are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an
      equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For
      as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with
      Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful
      blow from the elephant’s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared
      with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous
      flukes, which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire
      boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian
      juggler tosses his balls.*
    </p>
<p>
      *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and
      the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant
      stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the
      elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious
      similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant
      will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet
      it forth in a stream.
    </p>
<p>
      The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability
      to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would
      well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive
      herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have
      heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols;
      that the whale, indeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the
      world. Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general
      body, full of strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced
      assailant. Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him
      not, and never will. But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how
      understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has
      none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face
      shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and
      hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no face.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.
    </h2>
<p>
      The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
      the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In
      a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra,
      Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or
      rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long
      unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.
      This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of
      ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and
      Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the
      west, emerge into the China seas.
    </p>
<p>
      Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
      midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
      promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to
      the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering
      the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and
      ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched,
      it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the
      very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however
      ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. The
      shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering
      fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and
      the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the
      obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of
      ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day, have
      passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the
      costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial
      like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.
    </p>
<p>
      Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low
      shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels
      sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of
      their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have
      received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs
      has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day, we
      occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in those waters,
      have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
    </p>
<p>
      With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits;
      Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence,
      cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by
      the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far
      coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these
      means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm
      Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line
      in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit,
      firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most
      known to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be
      presumed to be haunting it.
    </p>
<p>
      But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew
      drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the
      circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no
      sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler.
      While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to
      foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but
      herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake’s
      contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not
      altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years’ water
      in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,
      the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish
      fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian
      streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from
      New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in
      all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having
      seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry
      them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer—“Well,
      boys, here’s the ark!”
     </p>
<p>
      Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java,
      in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the
      ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
      excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more
      upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to
      keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed
      on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was
      snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing
      all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh
      entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft,
      and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.
    </p>
<p>
      But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which
      of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,
      instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in
      former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes
      embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous
      nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance
      and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense
      caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising
      grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without
      being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what
      sometimes seems thousands on thousands.
    </p>
<p>
      Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
      forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
      continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
      noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
      Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft
      drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the
      Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising
      and falling away to leeward.
    </p>
<p>
      Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the
      sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air,
      and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the
      thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy
      autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
    </p>
<p>
      As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
      accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
      their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;
      even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
      the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and
      swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
    </p>
<p>
      Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling
      their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended
      boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through
      these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental
      seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could
      tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not
      temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the
      coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on
      stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a
      sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to
      something in our wake.
    </p>
<p>
      Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
      It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something
      like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and
      go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling
      his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying,
      “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;—Malays,
      sir, and after us!”
     </p>
<p>
      As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly
      have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit,
      to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with
      a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these
      tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen
      pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As
      with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn
      beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty
      pirates chasing <i>him</i>; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he
      glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was
      then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to
      his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both
      chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd
      of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally
      cheering him on with their curses;—when all these conceits had
      passed through his brain, Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the
      black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being
      able to drag the firm thing from its place.
    </p>
<p>
      But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,
      after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at
      last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging
      at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to
      grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to
      rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But
      still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating
      their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away,
      word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by
      some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of
      the three keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their
      rear,—than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
      battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked
      bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
    </p>
<p>
      Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after
      several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a
      general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they
      were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert
      irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say
      he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto
      rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;
      and like King Porus’ elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they
      seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast
      irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their
      short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic.
      This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who,
      completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged
      dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of
      simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could
      not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional
      timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding
      together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have
      fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when
      herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit, they will, at the
      slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
      trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,
      therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before
      us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
      infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
    </p>
<p>
      Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet
      it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
      retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
      those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
      whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,
      Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in
      our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for
      the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale
      struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed
      is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the
      more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags
      you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect
      life and only exist in a delirious throb.
    </p>
<p>
      As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
      speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
      thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the
      crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a
      ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer through their
      complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be
      locked in and crushed.
    </p>
<p>
      But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from
      this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from
      that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time,
      Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way
      whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to
      make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty
      was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting
      part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried one, to a great
      dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant
      threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail, there!” cried a second
      to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself
      with his own fan-like extremity.
    </p>
<p>
      All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by
      the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal
      size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other’s grain
      at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the
      middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can
      in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales
      that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than
      you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day
      encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you
      cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
      afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these
      the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of
      them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales
      staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of
      the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and
      ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the
      clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in
      an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
      boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came
      in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts
      in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.
    </p>
<p>
      It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not
      that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly diminished;
      moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference
      of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last
      the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;
      then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between
      two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain
      torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the
      roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In
      this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,
      called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in
      his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they
      say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted
      distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw
      successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and
      round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder
      to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
      middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density
      of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed
      axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.
      We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall
      that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of
      the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the
      women and children of this routed host.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
      outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any
      one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the
      whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles.
      At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be
      deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
      seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
      circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked
      up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had
      hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping;
      or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and
      inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales—now
      and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced
      a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic
      which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came
      snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it
      almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg
      patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but
      fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.
    </p>
<p>
      But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
      stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in
      those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
      whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
      mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
      exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly
      and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives
      at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
      spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so did
      the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if
      we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their
      sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little
      infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might
      have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He
      was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered
      from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
      reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the
      unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow. The delicate side-fins, and
      the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled
      appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived from foreign parts.
    </p>
<p>
      “Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him
      fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one
      little!”
     </p>
<p>
      “What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.
    </p>
<p>
      “Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.
    </p>
<p>
      As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
      fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows
      the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
      air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame
      Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not
      seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the
      maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub
      is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed
      divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in
      the deep.*
    </p>
<p>
      *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike
      most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation
      which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a
      time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and
      Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
      curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
      themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts
      in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s pouring
      milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very
      sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with
      strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute <i>more
      hominum</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
      affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
      fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in
      dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my
      being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and
      while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and
      deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
      spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still
      engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly
      carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and
      some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged
      drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles,
      was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when
      fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to
      hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic
      tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which
      is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we
      afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had
      broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon
      line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing
      among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
      battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.
    </p>
<p>
      But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
      enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire
      the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening
      distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the
      unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in
      the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the
      cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that
      weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his
      tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that
      tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently
      flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
      wounding and murdering his own comrades.
    </p>
<p>
      This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary
      fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a
      little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows
      from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the
      submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more
      contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in
      thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum
      was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when
      the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came
      tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one
      common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
      taking the stern.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your
      oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
      you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand
      up—stand up, and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind
      their backs—scrape them!—scrape away!”
     </p>
<p>
      The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
      narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor
      we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at
      the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar
      hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been
      one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently
      making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the
      loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the
      fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy
      made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.
    </p>
<p>
      Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
      resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped
      together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight
      with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still
      lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped
      astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The
      waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which are carried by every boat;
      and which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted upright into the
      floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also
      as token of prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw
      near.
    </p>
<p>
      The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
      saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the
      drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the
      time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft
      than the Pequod.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.
    </h2>
<p>
      The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
      Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
      vast aggregations.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have
      been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally
      observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are
      known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost
      entirely of females, and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or
      bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
    </p>
<p>
      In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
      male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
      his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
      ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
      over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and
      endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his
      concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
      leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more
      than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
      comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
      yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
      whole they are hereditarily entitled to <i>en bon point</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
      ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely
      search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower
      of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from
      spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all
      unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down
      the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in
      anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive
      temperature of the year.
    </p>
<p>
      When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
      suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
      interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming
      that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies, with
      what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away! High
      times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to
      invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the Bashaw will, he
      cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed; for, alas! all
      fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the most terrible
      duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes
      come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their long lower
      jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy
      like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured
      having the deep scars of these encounters,—furrowed heads, broken
      teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated
      mouths.
    </p>
<p>
      But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the
      first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that
      lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there
      awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious
      Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines. Granting other
      whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of
      these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength,
      and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the sons and the daughters
      they beget, why, those sons and daughters must take care of themselves; at
      least, with only the maternal help. For like certain other omnivorous
      roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the
      nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he
      leaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic. In
      good time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and
      dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a
      general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue
      supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent,
      repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and
      grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the
      meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young
      Leviathan from his amorous errors.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the
      lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster. It
      is therefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical, that
      after going to school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not
      what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would
      very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself,
      but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of
      Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself
      what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his
      younger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons he
      inculcated into some of his pupils.
    </p>
<p>
      The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
      betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales.
      Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is called—proves
      an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no
      one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the
      wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so
      many moody secrets.
    </p>
<p>
      The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
      mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those
      female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
      forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious of
      all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
      excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met, and
      these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
    </p>
<p>
      The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a
      mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
      tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
      prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad
      at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when
      about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of
      settlements, that is, harems.
    </p>
<p>
      Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still
      more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull—poor
      devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school,
      and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes
      lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.
    </h2>
<p>
      The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
      necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
      fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
    </p>
<p>
      It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a
      whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and
      captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor
      contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,—after
      a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose
      from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to
      leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it
      alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and
      violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not
      some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all
      cases.
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment,
      was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695.
      But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the
      American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this
      matter. They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness
      surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for
      the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s Business. Yes; these laws
      might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon,
      and worn round the neck, so small are they.
    </p>
<p>
      I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
    </p>
<p>
      II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
    </p>
<p>
      But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
      brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound
      it.
    </p>
<p>
      First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when
      it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all
      controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a
      nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
      same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any
      other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it
      plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as
      their intention so to do.
    </p>
<p>
      These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
      themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the
      Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and
      honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
      it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
      possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
      others are by no means so scrupulous.
    </p>
<p>
      Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in
      England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a
      whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
      succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
      their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
      itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up with
      the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the
      very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated
      with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’ teeth, and
      assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now
      retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the
      whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for
      the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
      judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
      illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein
      a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s viciousness, had at
      last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years,
      repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of
      her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying,
      that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once
      had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging
      viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that
      she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman
      re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman’s
      property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in
      her.
    </p>
<p>
      Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale
      and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
    </p>
<p>
      These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
      learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he
      awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save
      their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and
      line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a
      Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line
      because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a
      property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish
      had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo,
      the aforesaid articles were theirs.
    </p>
<p>
      A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
      possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter,
      the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously
      quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited
      case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on
      reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for
      notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the
      Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:
      that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often
      possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
      Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is
      the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s last
      mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble mansion
      with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the
      ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the
      bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from starvation; what is
      that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of
      Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of
      hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
      without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular £100,000 but a
      Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary towns and hamlets but
      Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland,
      but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas
      but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not Possession the whole of
      the law?
    </p>
<p>
      But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
      kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
      internationally and universally applicable.
    </p>
<p>
      What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
      Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?
      What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to
      England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.
    </p>
<p>
      What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish?
      What all men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of
      religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious
      smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is
      the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but a
      Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?

<h2>
      CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.
    </h2>
<p>
      “De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.” <i>Bracton,
      l. 3, c. 3.</i>
</p>
<p>
      Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
      context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
      that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
      and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,
      in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate
      remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force
      in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
      touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in
      a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the
      English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially
      reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious
      proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I
      proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two
      years.
    </p>
<p>
      It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of
      the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching
      a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore.
      Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a
      sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office
      directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to
      the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers this
      office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily
      employed at times in fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by
      virtue of that same fobbing of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
      trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat
      fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the precious oil
      and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale
      with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up steps
      a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of
      Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands
      off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord
      Warden’s.” Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so
      truly English—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching
      their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
      stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
      hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length
      one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to
      speak,
    </p>
<p>
      “Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The Duke.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is his.”
     </p>
<p>
      “We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
      that to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains
      but our blisters?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is his.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
      getting a livelihood?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is his.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this
      whale.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is his.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is his.”
     </p>
<p>
      In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
      Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
      lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
      deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of
      the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take
      the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which
      my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published) that he
      had already done so, and received the money, and would be obliged to the
      reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would
      decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this the still militant
      old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands
      coercing alms of beggars?
    </p>
<p>
      It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to
      the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire
      then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that
      right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the
      reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and
      Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the soundest
      commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters.
    </p>
<p>
      But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
      for that, ye lawyers!
    </p>
<p>
      In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench
      author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s, that
      ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this was
      written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right
      whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is not in
      the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer
      like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An
      allegorical meaning may lurk here.
    </p>
<p>
      There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the
      whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
      nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I
      know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference
      it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the
      whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to
      that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously
      grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there seems a reason in
      all things, even in law.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
    </h2>
<p>
      “In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,
      insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” <i>Sir T. Browne, V.E.</i>
</p>
<p>
      It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we
      were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many
      noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three
      pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in
      the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      “I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are
      some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
      would keel up before long.”
     </p>
<p>
      Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
      lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
      alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from
      his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and
      hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside
      must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has
      died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It
      may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale;
      worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent
      to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that
      no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there
      those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained
      from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the
      nature of attar-of-rose.
    </p>
<p>
      Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
      had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a
      nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those
      problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious
      dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely
      bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall
      see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale
      as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.
    </p>
<p>
      The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
      recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted
      round the tail of one of these whales.
    </p>
<p>
      “There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in the
      ship’s bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of
      Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their
      boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and
      sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow
      candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get
      won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all know these
      things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with our leavings,
      the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the
      dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say,
      pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a present of a little oil
      for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get from that drugged whale
      there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And
      as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and
      trying out these three masts of ours, than he’ll get from that bundle of
      bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a
      good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has
      thought of that. It’s worth trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he
      started for the quarter-deck.
    </p>
<p>
      By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or
      no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of
      escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb
      now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing
      across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French
      taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a
      huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes
      projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical
      folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in large gilt
      letters, he read “Bouton de Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and
      this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Though Stubb did not understand the <i>Bouton</i> part of the inscription, yet
      the word <i>rose</i>, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently
      explained the whole to him.
    </p>
<p>
      “A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will do
      very well; but how like all creation it smells!”
     </p>
<p>
      Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had
      to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the
      blasted whale; and so talk over it.
    </p>
<p>
      Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose,
      ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the
      chief-mate.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      “<i>What</i> whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The <i>White</i> Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
    </p>
<p>
      “Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”
     </p>
<p>
      Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over
      the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a
      trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab retired, and
      Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
    </p>
<p>
      He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains,
      and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.
    </p>
<p>
      “What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered
      the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much.
      “But what are you holding <i>yours</i> for?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t it?
      Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,
      Bouton-de-Rose?”
     </p>
<p>
      “What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,
      flying into a sudden passion.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those
      whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do
      you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
      such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his
      whole carcase.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe
      it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
      come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll get
      out of this dirty scrape.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb, and
      with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented
      itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the
      heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and
      talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses
      upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then
      pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get
      some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in
      coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken
      the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously
      puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories.
    </p>
<p>
      Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the
      Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery
      face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This
      was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the
      proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain’s round-house
      (<i>cabinet</i> he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help
      yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.
    </p>
<p>
      Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
      Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
      expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had
      brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him
      carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the
      slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace
      on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so
      that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and
      satirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their
      sincerity. According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,
      under cover of an interpreter’s office, was to tell the Captain what he
      pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any
      nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.
    </p>
<p>
      By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small
      and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large
      whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with
      watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely
      introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the
      aspect of interpreting between them.
    </p>
<p>
      “What shall I say to him first?” said he.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you
      may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
      though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
      captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and
      chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
      blasted whale they had brought alongside.”
     </p>
<p>
      Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
    </p>
<p>
      “What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
      carefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a whale-ship
      than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a baboon.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is
      far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,
      as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”
     </p>
<p>
      Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew
      to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the
      cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      “What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in
      fact, tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
      else.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to
      us.”
     </p>
<p>
      Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
      (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his
      cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
    </p>
<p>
      “He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.
    </p>
<p>
      “Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink with
      the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking; but
      that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had
      best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for
      it’s so calm they won’t drift.”
     </p>
<p>
      By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
      the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his
      boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter
      whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s boats, then,
      were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at
      his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long
      tow-line.
    </p>
<p>
      Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
      hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the
      Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly
      pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his
      intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
      cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the
      body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was
      digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck
      against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery
      buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew were all in high excitement,
      eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.
    </p>
<p>
      And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming,
      and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look
      disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly
      from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of
      perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being
      absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another,
      without at all blending with it for a time.
    </p>
<p>
      “I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in
      the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”
     </p>
<p>
      Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
      something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese;
      very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb;
      it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is
      ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls
      were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more,
      perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab’s loud
      command to Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid
      them good bye.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.
    </h2>
<p>
      Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
      article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin
      was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject.
      For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise
      origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned.
      Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet
      the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on
      the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris
      is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent,
      brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and
      ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,
      that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,
      hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it
      to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s
      in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
    </p>
<p>
      Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
      themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale!
      Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by
      others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a
      dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four boat
      loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of harm’s way, as
      laborers do in blasting rocks.
    </p>
<p>
      I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain
      hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors’
      trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more
      than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.
    </p>
<p>
      Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found
      in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying
      of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we
      are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that
      saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also
      forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor,
      Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the worst.
    </p>
<p>
      I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,
      owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and
      which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be considered
      as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman’s two
      whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been
      disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy
      business. But there is another thing to rebut. They hint that all whales
      always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma originate?
    </p>
<p>
      I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
      Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
      those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as
      the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in
      small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it
      home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and
      the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any
      other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and
      unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is
      given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city
      grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.
    </p>
<p>
      I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
      likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
      times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
      latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
      work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,
      fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place
      for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being
      taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces,
      fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation
      certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite
      different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years
      perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps,
      consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that
      it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or
      dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means
      creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of
      the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor
      indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a
      general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise;
      always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say,
      that the motion of a Sperm Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume,
      as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then
      shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?
      Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent
      with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander
      the Great?

<h2>
      CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.
    </h2>
<p>
      It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
      significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s crew; an
      event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly
      merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy
      of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some
      few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work
      the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,
      these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats’
      crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous
      wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was
      so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by
      abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his
      tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
    </p>
<p>
      In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a
      white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in
      one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and
      torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom
      very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his
      tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer,
      freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year’s calendar should
      show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New
      Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was
      brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous
      ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life’s
      peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had
      somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his
      brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily
      subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange
      wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural
      lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once
      enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on the green; and at melodious
      even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into one
      star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day, suspended
      against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful
      glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its
      most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then
      lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out
      those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond,
      once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel
      stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.
    </p>
<p>
      It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman
      chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and,
      temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
    </p>
<p>
      The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but
      happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
      therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
      him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to
      the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
    </p>
<p>
      Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the
      fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened,
      in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The involuntary
      consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the
      boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against
      his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in
      it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale
      started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor
      Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged
      there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and
      neck.
    </p>
<p>
      Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated
      Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended
      its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed
      interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face plainly looked,
      Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute,
      this entire thing happened.
    </p>
<p>
      “Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
      saved.
    </p>
<p>
      So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
      yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular
      cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still
      half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially
      gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat,
      Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice
      ever is. Now, in general, <i>Stick to the boat</i>, is your true motto in
      whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when <i>Leap from the boat</i>, is still
      better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give
      undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
      margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and
      concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the
      Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can’t afford to lose
      whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you
      would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don’t jump any more.”
       Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow,
      yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes
      with his benevolence.
    </p>
<p>
      But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
      under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time
      he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run,
      Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s trunk. Alas!
      Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue
      day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all
      round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin hammered out to the
      extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s ebon head showed like a
      head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.
      Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In
      three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb.
      Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black
      head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the
      brightest.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
      practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
      lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
      middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how
      when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely
      they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
    </p>
<p>
      But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he
      did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and
      he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very
      quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards
      oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested
      by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not
      unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called,
      is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies
      and armies.
    </p>
<p>
      But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying
      whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb’s boat
      was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that
      Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest
      chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little
      negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The
      sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his
      soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous
      depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and
      fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his
      hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,
      Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the
      firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the
      treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him
      mad. So man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal
      reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
      absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent
      as his God.
    </p>
<p>
      For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
      fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
      like abandonment befell myself.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.
    </h2>
<p>
      That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
      Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously
      detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of the
      Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
    </p>
<p>
      While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in
      dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and when
      the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere
      going to the try-works, of which anon.
    </p>
<p>
      It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several
      others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I found it
      strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid
      part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet
      and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a
      favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener!
      such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it for only a few
      minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine
      and spiralise.
    </p>
<p>
      As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
      exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
      indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among
      those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within
      the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their
      opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
      uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring
      violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow;
      I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm, I
      washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit the old
      Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat
      of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all
      ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.
    </p>
<p>
      Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
      till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange
      sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my
      co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules.
      Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this
      avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and
      looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,—Oh! my
      dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or
      know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all
      round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze
      ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.
    </p>
<p>
      Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by
      many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases
      man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable
      felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in
      the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the
      country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case
      eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of
      angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin
      to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.
    </p>
<p>
      First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
      part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is
      tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still
      contains some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is
      first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much
      like blocks of Berkshire marble.
    </p>
<p>
      Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
      whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
      often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a
      most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
      imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
      snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
      purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it
      is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole
      behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a
      royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing
      him to have been killed the first day after the venison season, and that
      particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of
      the vineyards of Champagne.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the
      course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
      adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original
      with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance. It is an
      ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the tubs of
      sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to
      be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.
    </p>
<p>
      Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
      sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the
      dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland
      or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls
      who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
    </p>
<p>
      Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s vocabulary.
      But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s nipper is a short
      firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan’s
      tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the
      size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it
      operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of
      magic, allures along with it all impurities.
    </p>
<p>
      But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once
      to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.
      This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
      blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper
      time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of
      terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull
      lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in
      pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is
      similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is
      something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet
      of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and
      lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,
      perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is
      sharp as hone can make it; the spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he
      stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.
      If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you
      be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.

      CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.
    </h2>
<p>
      Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
      post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
      windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
      curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
      there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
      cistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
      jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
      surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer
      than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
      jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is;
      or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in
      the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which,
      King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it
      for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th
      chapter of the First Book of Kings.
    </p>
<p>
      Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted
      by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it,
      and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
      carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle
      deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African
      hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a
      pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its
      diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere
      long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the
      pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other
      end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands
      before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to
      all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while
      employed in the peculiar functions of his office.
    </p>
<p>
      That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots;
      an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise
      against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the
      minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator’s desk. Arrayed
      in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves;
      what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this
      mincer!*
    </p>
<p>
      *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to
      the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin
      slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out
      the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased,
      besides perhaps improving it in quality.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.
    </h2>
<p>
      Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished
      by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
      masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It
      is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.
    </p>
<p>
      The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
      roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
      fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar,
      some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not
      penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by
      ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to
      the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely
      covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we
      expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels’
      capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they
      are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
      punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl
      into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in
      polishing them—one man in each pot, side by side—many
      confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a
      place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand
      try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me,
      that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in
      geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example,
      will descend from any point in precisely the same time.
    </p>
<p>
      Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry
      of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the
      furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy
      doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented from
      communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
      extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel
      inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
      fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
      from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
      It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were first
      started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the
      business.
    </p>
<p>
      “All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
      works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his
      shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in
      a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time
      with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition
      to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp,
      shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains
      considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames.
      Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once
      ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would
      that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and
      inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the
      time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk
      in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day
      of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.
    </p>
<p>
      By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
      carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
      darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
      flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
      illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire.
      The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to some
      vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold
      Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets
      of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and folded them
      in conflagrations.
    </p>
<p>
      The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth
      in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan
      harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge pronged poles they
      pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up
      the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors
      to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every
      pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all
      eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on
      the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served
      for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,
      looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in
      their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat,
      their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their
      teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of
      the works. As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their
      tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter
      forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and
      fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge
      pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and
      the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further
      and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
      champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all
      sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with
      fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness,
      seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s soul.
    </p>
<p>
      So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
      guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,
      in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the
      ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me,
      capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred
      visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable
      drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.
    </p>
<p>
      But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
      thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly
      conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side,
      which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just
      beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half
      conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching
      them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no compass
      before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been
      watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing
      seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of
      redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing
      I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all
      havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.
      Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that
      the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is
      the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself
      about, and was fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the
      compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel
      from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad
      and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the
      night, and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
    </p>
<p>
      Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
      hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint
      of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness
      makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies
      will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the
      morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious,
      golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but liars!
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s
      accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
      deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which
      is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So,
      therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that
      mortal man cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With books the
      same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all
      books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.
      “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian
      Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks
      fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls
      Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and
      throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and
      therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones,
      and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.
    </p>
<p>
      But even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of
      understanding shall remain” (<i>i.e.</i>, even while living) “in the congregation
      of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee,
      deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but
      there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some
      souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of
      them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for
      ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even
      in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds
      upon the plain, even though they soar.

      CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.
    </h2>
<p>
      Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s forecastle,
      where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would
      have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of
      canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken
      vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon
      his hooded eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens.
      To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his
      pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of
      light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin’s lamp, and
      lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night the ship’s black hull
      still houses an illumination.
    </p>
<p>
      See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps—often
      but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at the
      try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He burns,
      too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated
      state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore. It
      is sweet as early grass butter in April. He goes and hunts for his oil, so
      as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on
      the prairie hunts up his own supper of game.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
    </h2>
<p>
      Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried
      from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and
      slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and
      beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to
      the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded surtout
      becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned
      to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti,
      oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;—but now it remains to
      conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing—singing,
      if I may—the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the
      casks and striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan
      returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as
      before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.
    </p>
<p>
      While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel
      casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling this way and
      that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed
      over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery
      deck, like so many land slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in
      their course; and all round the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can
      play upon them, for now, <i>ex officio</i>, every sailor is a cooper.
    </p>
<p>
      At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great
      hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down
      go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are
      replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
    </p>
<p>
      In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents
      in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of
      blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale’s
      head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery
      yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the
      mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems great
      leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is deafening.
    </p>
<p>
      But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
      self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you
      would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most
      scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a
      singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look
      so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the
      ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and
      whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to
      the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the
      bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full
      tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous
      implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put
      away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works,
      completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are
      coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry
      of almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
      is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own
      ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the
      immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out
      the daintiest Holland.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
      humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
      propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not to
      taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such
      musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short of
      audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring
      us napkins!
    </p>
<p>
      But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on
      spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the
      old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere.
      Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors,
      which know no night; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours;
      when from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists with all day
      rowing on the Line,—they only step to the deck to carry vast chains,
      and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very
      sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the
      equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all
      this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make
      a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just
      buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of
      “There she blows!” and away they fly to fight another whale, and go
      through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is
      man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings
      extracted from this world’s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and
      then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its defilements, and
      learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this
      done, when—<i>There she blows!</i>—the ghost is spouted up, and away
      we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life’s old routine
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
      thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with thee
      along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught
      thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.
    </h2>
<p>
      Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
      taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
      the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added
      how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was
      wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the
      particular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his
      glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot
      like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when
      resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same
      riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore
      the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild
      longing, if not hopefulness.
    </p>
<p>
      But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
      attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though
      now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some
      monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some certain
      significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and
      the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the
      cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the
      Milky Way.
    </p>
<p>
      Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the
      heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the
      head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the
      rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,
      untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito
      glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by
      ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
      darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every
      sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set
      apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their
      sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s
      talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,
      wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to
      spend it.
    </p>
<p>
      Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and
      tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s disks and
      stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in
      luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to
      derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through
      those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
    </p>
<p>
      It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example
      of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL
      ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the
      middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;
      and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows
      no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes’
      summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing
      cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the
      signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun
      entering the equinoctial point at Libra.
    </p>
<p>
      Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
      pausing.
    </p>
<p>
      “There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all
      other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as
      Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
      courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
      are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
      which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors
      back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask
      the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined
      sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the
      equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at
      Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, ’tis fit that
      man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here’s stout
      stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must have
      left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to himself,
      leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read Belshazzar’s
      awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below;
      let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks,
      that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this
      vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of
      Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes,
      the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun
      meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture;
      and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we
      gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still
      sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”
     </p>
<p>
      “There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s
      been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
      faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And
      all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill
      or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph!
      in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen
      doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your
      doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia,
      your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and
      joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this
      doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me
      read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what
      old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below
      calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised
      with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of
      these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the
      book. Let’s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he’s always among
      ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are—here they go—all alive:—Aries,
      or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the
      Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among ’em. Aye, here on the coin he’s just
      crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.
      Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll
      do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the
      thoughts. That’s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts
      calendar, and Bowditch’s navigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and
      wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant
      in wonders! There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By
      Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man
      in one round chapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book.
      Come, Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog,
      he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing;
      then Gemini, or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach
      Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going
      from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few
      fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the
      Virgin! that’s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,
      when pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found
      wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump,
      as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the
      wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer,
      is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the
      battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and
      headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his
      whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we
      sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through
      it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he,
      aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does
      jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here
      comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let’s hear
      what he’ll have to say. There; he’s before it; he’ll out with something
      presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a
      certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all this
      staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at two
      cents the cigar, that’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t smoke dirty
      pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here’s nine hundred and sixty of
      them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ’em out.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
      foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of
      wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old
      hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He
      luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of
      the mast; why, there’s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he’s back
      again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s muttering—voice like an old
      worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”
     </p>
<p>
      “If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the
      sun stands in some one of these signs. I’ve studied signs, and know their
      marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in
      Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign;
      for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what’s the horse-shoe sign?
      The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the roaring and devouring lion.
      Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”
     </p>
<p>
      “There’s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in
      one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg—all
      tattooing—looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
      Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
      thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
      suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon’s Astronomy in the back country.
      And by Jove, he’s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—I
      guess it’s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don’t know what to make of
      the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king’s trowsers. But,
      aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of
      sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say,
      with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself;
      there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more
      and more. This way comes Pip—poor boy! would he had died, or I; he’s
      half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters—myself
      included—and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot
      face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving his mind,
      poor fellow! But what’s that he says now—hist!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, that’s funny.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a crow,
      especially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw! caw! caw!
      caw! caw! Ain’t I a crow? And where’s the scare-crow? There he stands; two
      bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the
      sleeves of an old jacket.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could
      go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s vicinity. I can
      stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he’s too crazy-witty for my
      sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Here’s the ship’s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to
      unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what’s the consequence? Then
      again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught’s nailed to the
      mast it’s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White
      Whale; he’ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland
      county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in
      it; some old darkey’s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they’ll
      say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find
      a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the
      gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser’ll hoard ye soon!
      Hish! hish! God goes ’mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and
      cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your
      hoe-cake done!”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
    </h2>
<h3>
      The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
    </h3>
<p>
      “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing
      down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his
      hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
      captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s bow. He was a
      darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or
      thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in
      festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
      behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      “See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he
      held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like
      a mallet.
    </p>
<p>
      “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
      him—“Stand by to lower!”
     </p>
<p>
      In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew
      were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But
      here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the
      moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
      once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was
      always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
      the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel
      at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody—except
      those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen—to clamber up
      a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift
      the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it
      half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship
      of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now
      found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly
      eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
    </p>
<p>
      It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
      circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
      luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in
      the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two
      officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular
      ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of
      tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink
      them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea
      bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange
      captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, “I see, I
      see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the
      cutting-tackle.”
     </p>
<p>
      As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
      previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved
      blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was
      quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his
      solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the
      fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the
      word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own
      weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the
      tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently
      landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in
      welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg,
      and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his
      walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!—an arm
      and a leg!—an arm that never can shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that
      never can run. Where did’st thou see the White Whale?—how long ago?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the
      East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope;
      “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from the
      capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,” began
      the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one
      day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to
      one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and
      milling round so, that my boat’s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all
      their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom
      of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all
      crows’ feet and wrinkles.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
      breath.
    </p>
<p>
      “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye—they were mine—<i>my</i> irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but
      on!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well, this
      old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into
      the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old
      trick—I know him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not know;
      but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow;
      but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line,
      bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale’s; that
      went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a
      noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in
      my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he
      seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the
      tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat’s crew
      for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my
      first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the way, Captain—Mounttop;
      Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped into
      Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then;
      and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.
      But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls alive, man—the next
      instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes out—all
      befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail looming
      straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No
      use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding
      sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to
      toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my
      boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white
      hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck
      out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole
      sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a
      combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one
      good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed
      second iron towing along near me caught me here” (clapping his hand just
      below his shoulder); “yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to
      Hell’s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good
      God, the barb ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole
      length of my arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and
      that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr.
      Bunger, ship’s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger
      boy, spin your part of the yarn.”
     </p>
<p>
      The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the
      time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his
      gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober
      one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched
      trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
      marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
      occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
      crippled captains. But, at his superior’s introduction of him to Ahab, he
      politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’s bidding.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my
      advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed
      captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot
      weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat
      up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering
      his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn’t
      see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about
      three o’clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and
      was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically
      severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don’t ye? You know
      you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I’d rather be
      killed by you than kept alive by any other man.”
     </p>
<p>
      “My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said
      the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is
      apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort.
      But I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I
      myself—that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am
      a strict total abstinence man; I never drink—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to
      him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on
      with the arm story.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,
      sir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my best
      and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth
      was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two
      feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short,
      it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no
      hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule”—pointing
      at it with the marlingspike—“that is the captain’s work, not mine;
      he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to
      the end, to knock some one’s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine
      once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent,
      sir”—removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a
      bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry
      trace, or any token of ever having been a wound—“Well, the captain
      there will tell you how that came here; he knows.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with it.
      Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another
      Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
      pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
      impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
      didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn’t
      then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some
      time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick—as
      some call him—and then I knew it was he.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Did’st thou cross his wake again?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Twice.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But could not fasten?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without
      this other arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so much as he
      swallows.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to get
      the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically
      bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that
      the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
      Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even
      a man’s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White
      Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a
      single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like
      the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making
      believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in
      good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave
      him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d’ye see. No possible
      way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his
      general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about
      it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of
      giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only
      let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that’s all.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the arm
      he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to
      another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once, and
      that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know
      that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,
      he’s best let alone; don’t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the
      ivory leg.
    </p>
<p>
      “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone,
      that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a magnet!
      How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly
      walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s blood—bring
      the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes
      these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and
      drawing near to Ahab’s arm.
    </p>
<p>
      “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the
      boat! Which way heading?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
      “What’s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain
      crazy?” whispering Fedallah.
    </p>
<p>
      But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take
      the boat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards
      him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.
    </p>
<p>
      In a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men were
      springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back
      to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood
      upright till alongside of the Pequod.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.
    </h2>
<p>
      Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
      hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant
      of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby &amp;
      Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not far behind
      the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real
      historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this
      great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not
      make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships
      that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years
      previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and
      the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the
      North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here,
      that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with
      civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they
      were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.
    </p>
<p>
      In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and
      at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and
      was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the
      great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to
      her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia’s example
      was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast
      Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with
      this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and
      all his Sons—how many, their mother only knows—and under their
      immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British
      government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling
      voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain,
      the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much
      does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a
      discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote
      waters of Japan. That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a
      noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling
      Ground first became generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was
      commanded by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.
    </p>
<p>
      All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
      the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have
      slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.
    </p>
<p>
      The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast
      sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
      somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
      forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every
      soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam
      I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
      ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of
      that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I
      ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it
      at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s
      squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were
      called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
      other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
      jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling
      gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go
      overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass
      the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle
      scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste.
    </p>
<p>
      The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was
      bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
      certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
      symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you
      could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. If
      you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you
      like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be helped; besides,
      it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the only fresh
      fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy
      to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking
      her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook’s boilers,
      including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel
      Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong;
      crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.
    </p>
<p>
      But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English
      whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable
      ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
      joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I
      will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter
      for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical
      whale research, when it has seemed needed.
    </p>
<p>
      The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
      Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in
      the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty
      to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship
      scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English,
      this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental
      and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is
      here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.
    </p>
<p>
      During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
      ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must
      be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I concluded that
      this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the
      fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in
      this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one “Fitz
      Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of
      Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott’s, to
      whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles
      for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the
      book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The Cooper,” but “The
      Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of
      the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very
      interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was,
      headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a long detailed list of the
      outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from
      which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:
    </p>
<p>
      400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
      fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of
      butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel &amp; Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
      (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
      beer.
    </p>
<p>
      Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the
      present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,
      barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
    </p>
<p>
      At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
      beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
      incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic
      application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my own,
      touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by every Low
      Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery.
      In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese
      consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous
      natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their
      vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid
      Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the
      convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.
    </p>
<p>
      The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
      polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
      climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
      including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much
      exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of
      180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have
      precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’ allowance,
      exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin. Now, whether
      these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have
      been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat’s head, and take
      good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they
      did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it
      remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the
      Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer
      sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might
      ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
    </p>
<p>
      But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of
      two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers
      have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising
      in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a
      good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the decanter.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.
    </h2>
<p>
      Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
      dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
      upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
      sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
      further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and
      casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones,
      set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional
      skeleton.
    </p>
<p>
      But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,
      pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did
      erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy
      of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for
      exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on
      your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A
      veritable witness have you hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you
      seize the privilege of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the
      joists and beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings,
      making up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,
      dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.
    </p>
<p>
      I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath
      the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an
      opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small
      cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag,
      to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the
      lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and
      jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that
      young cub?
    </p>
<p>
      And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
      gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to
      my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For
      being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of
      Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the
      lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not
      very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.
    </p>
<p>
      Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
      with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together
      in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could
      invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells,
      inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed
      among whatever natural wonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering
      waves had cast upon his shores.
    </p>
<p>
      Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
      unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
      head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed
      his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of its
      fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the
      skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand
      temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
    </p>
<p>
      The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with
      Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
      kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again
      sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific
      lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so
      affrighted Damocles.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the
      trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious
      earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it,
      whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living
      flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the
      shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these
      unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun
      seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver!
      unseen weaver!—pause!—one word!—whither flows the
      fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings?
      Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single word with thee!
      Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the loom;
      the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he
      weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice;
      and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only
      when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it.
      For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are
      inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard
      without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have
      villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all
      this din of the great world’s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be
      overheard afar.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
      great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler!
      Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
      him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
      with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself
      a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived
      with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
      skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet
      had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object
      of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear
      that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton—brushed
      the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and with a ball of
      Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded
      colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I
      emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no living thing within;
      naught was there but bones.
    </p>
<p>
      Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.
      From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the
      altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st thou measure
      this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long do ye
      make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning
      feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with their yard-sticks—the
      great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly
      concluded my own admeasurements.
    </p>
<p>
      These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
      recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
      measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer
      to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in
      Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where they have
      some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard
      that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the
      proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale
      in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton
      Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession
      the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the
      full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo’s.
    </p>
<p>
      In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged,
      were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King
      Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was
      lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford’s whale has been
      articulated throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can
      open and shut him, in all his bony cavities—spread out his ribs like
      a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be
      put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show
      round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir Clifford
      thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the
      spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his
      cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.
    </p>
<p>
      The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
      verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
      wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
      such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished the
      other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then
      composing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did
      not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
      enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale’s Skeleton.
    </h2>
<p>
      In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
      statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we
      are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.
    </p>
<p>
      According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base
      upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
      Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
      calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
      eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet
      in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety
      tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably
      outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one
      hundred inhabitants.
    </p>
<p>
      Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this
      leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?
    </p>
<p>
      Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw,
      teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply
      point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed
      bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of
      the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated
      part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you
      must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we proceed,
      otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we
      are about to view.
    </p>
<p>
      In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
      feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been
      ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in
      length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull
      and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain
      back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a third of
      its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his
      vitals.
    </p>
<p>
      To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
      extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the
      hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of
      her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time,
      but a long, disconnected timber.
    </p>
<p>
      The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly
      six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively
      longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle
      ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From that part, the
      remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned five feet
      and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly
      correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most arched. In
      some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath
      bridges over small streams.
    </p>
<p>
      In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
      circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the
      whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the
      Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish
      which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the
      invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen
      feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
      feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living
      magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked
      spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in
      flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here
      saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic,
      but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
    </p>
<p>
      How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to
      comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead
      attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the
      heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry
      flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale
      be truly and livingly found out.
    </p>
<p>
      But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane,
      to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it’s done,
      it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.
    </p>
<p>
      There are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not
      locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic
      spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one,
      is in width something less than three feet, and in depth more than four.
      The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two
      inches in width, and looks something like a white billiard-ball. I was
      told that there were still smaller ones, but they had been lost by some
      little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children, who had stolen them to
      play marbles with. Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of
      living things tapers off at last into simple child’s play.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.
    </h2>
<p>
      From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to
      enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
      compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
      folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the
      yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic involutions
      of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers
      coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
      approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking
      the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the
      uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him in most of his
      present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify
      him in an archæological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.
      Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such
      portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when
      Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this
      emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said,
      that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these
      dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson,
      expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s
      uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by
      a whale author like me.
    </p>
<p>
      One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though
      it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this
      Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals.
      Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an inkstand!
      Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this
      Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching
      comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the
      sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past,
      present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth,
      and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and so
      magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its
      bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great
      and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be
      who have tried it.
    </p>
<p>
      Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials
      as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a
      stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,
      wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of
      preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier
      geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
      completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called
      the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted
      links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote
      posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto
      discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the
      superficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any
      known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them
      in general respects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.
    </p>
<p>
      Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
      and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been
      found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in
      Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among
      the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year
      1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening
      almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in
      excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s time. Cuvier
      pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown
      Leviathanic species.
    </p>
<p>
      But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
      complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on
      the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous
      slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels.
      The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the
      name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken across the
      sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out that this alleged
      reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A significant
      illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that the
      skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully
      invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his
      paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in
      substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of
      the globe have blotted out of existence.
    </p>
<p>
      When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws,
      ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to the
      existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other
      hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their
      incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous
      period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for time began with
      man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering
      glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed
      hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this
      world’s circumference, not an inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was
      visible. Then the whole world was the whale’s; and, king of creation, he
      left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who
      can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood
      than the Pharaoh’s. Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake
      hands with Shem. I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced
      existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been
      before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
    </p>
<p>
      But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
      stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
      ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
      for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print
      of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty
      years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and
      painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins,
      similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.
      Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in
      that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of
      the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by the
      venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of
      which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
      oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that
      by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it
      without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either
      side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and
      wound the Whales when they light upon ’em. They keep a Whale’s Rib of an
      incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with its
      convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached
      by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have
      layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm, that
      a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do
      not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at
      the Base of the Temple.”
     </p>
<p>
      In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a
      Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?
    </h2>
<p>
      Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the
      head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the
      long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original
      bulk of his sires.
    </p>
<p>
      But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
      present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found
      in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to
      man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to
      its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones.
    </p>
<p>
      Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
      Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy
      feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the
      tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized
      modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority, that Sperm Whales
      have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.
    </p>
<p>
      But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
      advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it
      not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
      gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells
      us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others
      which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope Walks and Thames
      Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke’s
      naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting
      down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one
      hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And
      Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in
      the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one
      hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was
      published so late as A.D. 1825.
    </p>
<p>
      But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as
      big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I,
      a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I
      cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were
      buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so
      much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the
      cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh
      tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as
      plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield,
      not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh’s fat
      kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the
      whale alone should have degenerated.
    </p>
<p>
      But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
      recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs
      at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through
      Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the
      world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental
      coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a
      chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be
      exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke
      his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.
    </p>
<p>
      Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
      which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
      of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with
      their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,
      where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a
      comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the
      hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.
    </p>
<p>
      But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period
      ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois
      exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
      not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
      cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
      different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
      end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for
      forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God, if
      at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the
      old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far
      west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the
      same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on
      horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty
      thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be
      statistically stated.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual
      extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the
      latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods,
      were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the
      voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative.
      Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some
      views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large
      degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other
      days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.
      That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the
      so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
      abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are
      only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer
      enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand
      has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
    </p>
<p>
      Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
      firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
      impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss
      have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades
      of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their
      Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls
      there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle of
      everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
    </p>
<p>
      But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
      cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
      positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But
      though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000,
      have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the Americans alone;
      yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little
      or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.
    </p>
<p>
      Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of
      the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto,
      the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of
      Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as
      droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to
      doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of
      years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive
      monarchs of the East—if they still survive there in great numbers,
      much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture
      to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both
      Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
      combined.
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
      whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore
      at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be
      contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by
      imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of creation
      yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who were
      alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to the
      present human population of the globe.
    </p>
<p>
      Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
      species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before
      the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries,
      and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he despised Noah’s
      Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands,
      to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and
      rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed
      defiance to the skies.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.
    </h2>
<p>
      The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
      Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his
      own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that
      his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after
      gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently
      wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever,
      something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already
      shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it
      still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem
      it entirely trustworthy.
    </p>
<p>
      And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
      pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
      condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
      been very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he had
      been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some
      unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb
      having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and
      all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the
      agonizing wound was entirely cured.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the
      anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
      former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous
      reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
      songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable
      events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought
      Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the
      ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an
      inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural
      enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,
      but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all
      hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely
      beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the
      grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the
      deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest
      earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in
      them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some
      men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie
      the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal
      miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the
      gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
      cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the
      gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in
      the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.
    </p>
<p>
      Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
      properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
      particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why
      it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing of
      the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like
      exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it
      were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg’s bruited reason
      for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching
      all Ahab’s deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant
      darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came out; this
      one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his
      temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,
      dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a
      less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted
      casualty—remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested
      itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spirits and
      of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so
      far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others;
      and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did
      it transpire upon the Pequod’s decks.
    </p>
<p>
      But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or
      the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with
      earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain
      practical procedures;—he called the carpenter.
    </p>
<p>
      And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay
      set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied
      with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus
      far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of
      the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the
      carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to
      provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the
      distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship’s forge was ordered to be
      hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the
      affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of
      whatever iron contrivances might be needed.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.
    </h2>
<p>
      Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
      abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
      from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
      seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
      But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the
      high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate; hence,
      he now comes in person on this stage.
    </p>
<p>
      Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to
      whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike
      experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the
      carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those
      numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an
      auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic
      remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in
      those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a
      large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in uncivilized and
      far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:—repairing
      stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars,
      inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks,
      and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special
      business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of
      conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.
    </p>
<p>
      The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
      was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
      vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
      except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
      athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
    </p>
<p>
      A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the
      carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files
      it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is
      made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and
      cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking
      cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a
      soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the
      blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the
      carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy
      to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has
      the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his
      bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces
      under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden
      vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have
      him draw the tooth.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and
      without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed
      but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now
      upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness
      of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon
      vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man
      more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were;
      impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of
      things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the
      whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,
      still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig
      foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,
      involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet
      was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,
      wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled
      wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight
      watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old
      carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro,
      not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever
      small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a
      stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
      babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You
      might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a
      sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to
      work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been
      tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but
      merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a
      pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed
      along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those
      unreasoning but still highly useful, <i>multum in parvo</i>, Sheffield
      contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little swelled—of
      a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,
      but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,
      nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the
      carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of
      him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs,
      and there they were.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was,
      after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common
      soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its
      duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of
      hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it had abided
      for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
      unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a
      great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel,
      which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box
      and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep
      himself awake.

      CHAPTER 108. Ahab and the Carpenter.
    </h2>
<h3>
      The Deck—First Night Watch.
    </h3>
<p>
      (<i>Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
      lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly
      fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and
      various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red flame
      of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.</i>)
    </p>
<p>
      Drat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft, and
      that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
      shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now, this works better (<i>sneezes</i>).
      Halloa, this bone dust is (<i>sneezes</i>)—why it’s (<i>sneezes</i>)—yes
      it’s (<i>sneezes</i>)—bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what an
      old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
      don’t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don’t get it (<i>sneezes</i>).
      Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let’s have that ferule
      and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready for them presently. Lucky now (<i>sneezes</i>)
      there’s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere
      shinbone—why it’s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to
      put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn
      him out as neat a leg now as ever (<i>sneezes</i>) scraped to a lady in a parlor.
      Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t
      compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and
      have to be doctored (<i>sneezes</i>) with washes and lotions, just like live
      legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and
      see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess.
      Ha! that’s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s somebody else,
      that’s certain.
    </p>
<p>
      AHAB (<i>advancing</i>). (<i>During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
      sneezing at times.</i>)
    </p>
<p>
      Well, manmaker!
    </p>
<p>
      Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let
      me measure, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      Measured for a leg! good. Well, it’s not the first time. About it! There;
      keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter;
      let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!
    </p>
<p>
      No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery
      world that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the
      blacksmith, I mean—what’s he about?
    </p>
<p>
      He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
    </p>
<p>
      Right. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce
      red flame there!
    </p>
<p>
      Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
    </p>
<p>
      Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
      Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith,
      and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must properly belong
      to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the
      remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he’s through
      with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades;
      there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.
    </p>
<p>
      Sir?
    </p>
<p>
      Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after a
      desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
      modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to ’em, to stay in
      one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass
      forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see—shall
      I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head
      to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, what’s he speaking about, and who’s he speaking to, I should like to
      know? Shall I keep standing here? (<i>aside</i>).
    </p>
<p>
      ’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one. No,
      no, no; I must have a lantern.
    </p>
<p>
      Ho, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
    </p>
<p>
      What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted
      light is worse than presented pistols.
    </p>
<p>
      I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
    </p>
<p>
      Carpenter? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an
      extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;—or
      would’st thou rather work in clay?
    </p>
<p>
      Sir?—Clay? clay, sir? That’s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      The fellow’s impious! What art thou sneezing about?
    </p>
<p>
      Bone is rather dusty, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
      living people’s noses.
    </p>
<p>
      Sir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!
    </p>
<p>
      Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
      workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy
      work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless
      feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that is, carpenter,
      my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive
      that old Adam away?
    </p>
<p>
      Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
      something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
      entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking
      him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
    </p>
<p>
      It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was;
      so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul.
      Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair,
      do I. Is’t a riddle?
    </p>
<p>
      I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
      may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
      thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
      solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t speak!
      And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long
      dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of
      hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
    </p>
<p>
      Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I
      think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long before
      the leg is done?
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps an hour, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (<i>turns to go</i>). Oh, Life! Here I
      am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a
      bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not
      do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I’m down in the whole
      world’s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the
      wealthiest Prætorians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the
      world’s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By
      heavens! I’ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one
      small, compendious vertebra. So.
    </p>
<p>
      CARPENTER (<i>resuming his work</i>).
    </p>
<p>
      Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he’s
      queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he’s queer,
      says Stubb; he’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr.
      Starbuck all the time—queer—sir—queer, queer, very
      queer. And here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his
      bedfellow! has a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his
      leg; he’ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in
      three places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was
      that? Oh! I don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of
      strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like.
      Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out
      into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you
      under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for life-boats. And
      here’s the heron’s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks
      one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them
      mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old
      coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to
      death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the
      cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and
      let’s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his
      horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old
      beer barrels, to fill ’em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a
      real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he’ll be standing on
      this to-morrow; he’ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot
      the little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.
      So, so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.
    </h2>
<p>
      According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
      inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
      sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the
      cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*
    </p>
<p>
      *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a
      regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the
      casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed
      by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight;
      while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners
      readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
      the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the
      China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general
      chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another
      separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands—Niphon,
      Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the
      screwed leg of his table, and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in
      his hand, the wondrous old man, with his back to the gangway door, was
      wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old courses again.
    </p>
<p>
      “Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round to
      it. “On deck! Begone!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We
      must up Burtons and break out.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
      for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good
      in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving,
      sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “So it is, so it is; if we get it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak!
      I’m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks,
      but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far worse plight
      than the Pequod’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak; for who can find
      it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found, in this
      life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not have the Burtons hoisted.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What will the owners say, sir?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
      cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about
      those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye,
      the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my
      conscience is in this ship’s keel.—On deck!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
      with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
      not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of
      itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself; “A
      better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
      enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On
      deck!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be
      forbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,
      Captain Ahab?”
     </p>
<p>
      Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
      South-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
      exclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain
      that is lord over the Pequod.—On deck!”
     </p>
<p>
      For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you
      would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the
      levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he
      quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: “Thou hast outraged,
      not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck;
      thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself,
      old man.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!”
       murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. “What’s that he said—Ahab
      beware of Ahab—there’s something there!” Then unconsciously using
      the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the
      little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
      returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
    </p>
<p>
      “Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” he said lowly to the mate;
      then raising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and
      close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and
      break out in the main-hold.”
     </p>
<p>
      It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
      Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him; or
      mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade
      the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient, in the
      important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders were
      executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.
    </h2>
<p>
      Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were
      perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm
      weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the
      huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those
      gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so
      ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons,
      that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing
      coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly warning
      the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after tierce, too, of
      water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of
      hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get
      about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over
      empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted
      demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all
      Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them
      then.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
      bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to
      his endless end.
    </p>
<p>
      Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
      dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher
      you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer,
      must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but—as we have
      elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally
      descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that
      subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and
      see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the
      holders, so called.
    </p>
<p>
      Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have
      stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped
      to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that
      dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well.
      And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where,
      strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible
      chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days’ suffering,
      laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How
      he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there
      seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else
      in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless,
      seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of
      lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a
      wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die, or
      be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter,
      expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of
      Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by
      the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as
      any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
      wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
      the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
      with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
      adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee
      or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious
      shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay
      in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to
      his final rest, and the ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
      higher towards his destined heaven.
    </p>
<p>
      Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what
      he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked. He
      called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just
      breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced
      to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his
      native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died
      in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of
      being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of
      his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in
      his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes;
      for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond
      all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with
      the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way. He
      added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
      according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
      death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket,
      all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat
      these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but
      uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was
      at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might include.
      There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon
      a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the
      Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to
      be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking
      his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his
      character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg’s measure with
      great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s person as he shifted the
      rule.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island
      sailor.
    </p>
<p>
      Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
      reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin
      was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at
      its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to
      work.
    </p>
<p>
      When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
      lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether
      they were ready for it yet in that direction.
    </p>
<p>
      Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on
      deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s
      consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
      him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
      dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly
      trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.
    </p>
<p>
      Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
      attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn
      from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of
      the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then
      ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the
      head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot;
      and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now
      entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its
      comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told
      one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his
      arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch
      he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a
      leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his
      composed countenance in view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he
      murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.
    </p>
<p>
      But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this
      while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by
      the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
    </p>
<p>
      “Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go
      ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the
      beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for
      me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think he’s in those
      far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad;
      for look! he’s left his tambourine behind;—I found it. Rig-a-dig,
      dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye your dying march.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in
      violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
      that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly
      forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their
      hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this
      strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our
      heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he speaks
      again: but more wildly now.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his harpoon?
      Lay it across here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock
      now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye that;
      Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I
      say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all
      a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the
      Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped
      from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail
      him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all
      cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that jumped from
      a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”
     </p>
<p>
      During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was
      led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
    </p>
<p>
      But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that
      his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there
      seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some expressed
      their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his
      sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he had just
      recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore
      had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They
      asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign
      will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg’s
      conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not
      kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
      unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
      that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally
      speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good
      time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after sitting on the
      windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he
      suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a
      good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of
      his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a
      fight.
    </p>
<p>
      With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
      emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many
      spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque
      figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his
      rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. And this
      tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island,
      who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete
      theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of
      attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to
      unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even
      himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these
      mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the
      living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
      last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild
      exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor
      Queequeg—“Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!”

      CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.
    </h2>
<p>
      When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South
      Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific
      with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was
      answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of
      blue.
    </p>
<p>
      There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
      awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
      fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
      John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
      prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should rise
      and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades
      and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call
      lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in
      their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.
    </p>
<p>
      To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
      ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the
      world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves
      wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted
      by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts
      of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between float milky-ways
      of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and
      impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the
      world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the
      tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs
      must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
    </p>
<p>
      But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
      statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril
      he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose
      sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously
      inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated
      White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at length upon these
      almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the
      old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a
      vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in
      his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, “Stern all!
      the White Whale spouts thick blood!”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.
    </h2>
<p>
      Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
      these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
      shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith,
      had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his
      contributory work for Ahab’s leg, but still retained it on deck, fast
      lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked
      by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for
      them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and
      boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all
      waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and
      lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled.
      Nevertheless, this old man’s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient
      arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent,
      slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back,
      he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his
      hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.—Most
      miserable!
    </p>
<p>
      A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
      yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
      curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted
      questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
      one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.
    </p>
<p>
      Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road
      running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the
      deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
      dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet.
      Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of
      the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of
      the grief of his life’s drama.
    </p>
<p>
      He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
      encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been an
      artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and
      garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe,
      ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in
      a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in
      a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home,
      and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith
      himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family’s heart. It
      was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew
      the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and
      economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was in the basement of his
      dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young
      and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with
      vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband’s
      hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and
      walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout
      Labor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s infants were rocked to slumber.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst
      thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him,
      then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly
      venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of
      them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder
      brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of
      some other family, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till
      the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.
    </p>
<p>
      Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
      and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the
      wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing
      into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked
      up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived down into the long
      church-yard grass; her children twice followed her thither; and the
      houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every
      woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!
    </p>
<p>
      Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is
      only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the
      first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the
      Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men,
      who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide,
      does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth
      his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life
      adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand
      mermaids sing to them—“Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another
      life without the guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders
      supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life
      which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more
      oblivious than death. Come hither! put up <i>thy</i> gravestone, too, within the
      churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!”
     </p>
<p>
      Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall
      of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went
      a-whaling.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 113. The Forge.
    </h2>
<p>
      With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
      mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed
      upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and
      with the other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along,
      carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a
      little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth,
      withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil—the
      red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which
      flew close to Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      “Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in
      thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they
      burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting
      for a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st thou
      scorch a scar.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to
      me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is
      not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?
      How can’st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee,
      that thou can’st not go mad?—What wert thou making there?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
      usage as it had?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I think so, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind
      how hard the metal, blacksmith?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with
      both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—<i>here</i>—can ye
      smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his
      ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my
      head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer!
      Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though
      thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of
      my skull—<i>that</i> is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s play; no more
      gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the leathern bag, as if it
      were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand
      yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale
      like his own fin-bone. There’s the stuff,” flinging the pouch upon the
      anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the
      steel shoes of racing horses.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best
      and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
      melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
      first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these
      twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I’ll blow
      the fire.”
     </p>
<p>
      When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
      spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A
      flaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”
     </p>
<p>
      This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab
      stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with
      regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the
      glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up
      its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over
      his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on
      the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
    </p>
<p>
      “What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered Stubb,
      looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and
      smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”
     </p>
<p>
      At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
      Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
      by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.
    </p>
<p>
      “Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain; “have
      I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
      harpoon for the White Whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      “For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself,
      man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the barbs
      sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”
     </p>
<p>
      For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain
      not use them.
    </p>
<p>
      “Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,
      nor pray till—but here—to work!”
     </p>
<p>
      Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank,
      the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was
      about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried
      to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
      there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as
      much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster of dark
      nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the
      White Whale’s barbs were then tempered.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!” deliriously
      howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal
      blood.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,
      with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the
      iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it
      taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot
      upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending
      over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, “Good! and now for the
      seizings.”
     </p>
<p>
      At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
      were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was
      then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was
      traced half-way along the pole’s length, and firmly secured so, with
      intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the
      Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with
      the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,
      both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,
      light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,
      Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange
      mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy
      ship, and mocked it!

<h2>
      CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.
    </h2>
<p>
      Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
      ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
      pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the
      stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or
      paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes
      calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success for their
      pains.
    </p>
<p>
      At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
      heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
      sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
      cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
      quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean’s
      skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not
      willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.
    </p>
<p>
      These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
      certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
      regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only
      the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high rolling
      waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when the
      western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their hidden
      bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
    </p>
<p>
      The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there
      steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie
      sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of
      the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so
      that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one
      seamless whole.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
      temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to
      open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them
      prove but tarnishing.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,—though
      long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye, men yet
      may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few
      fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to
      God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of
      life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for
      every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do
      not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:—through
      infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless faith, adolescence’
      doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last
      in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the
      round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies
      the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the
      world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling’s
      father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die
      in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we
      must there to learn it.
    </p>
<p>
      And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that
      same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—
    </p>
<p>
      “Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s eye!—Tell
      me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let
      faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe.”
     </p>
<p>
      And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden
      light:—
    </p>
<p>
      “I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he
      has always been jolly!”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.
    </h2>
<p>
      And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
      before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last
      cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad
      holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing
      round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing
      her prow for home.
    </p>
<p>
      The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting
      at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;
      and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the
      last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were
      flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her
      three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her
      top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid;
      and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.
    </p>
<p>
      As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising
      success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas
      numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single
      fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room
      for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had
      been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along
      the deck, and in the captain’s and officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin
      table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined
      off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a
      centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and
      pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the
      cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the
      steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the
      harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that
      indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons
      pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in
      self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
      As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
      barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
      still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
      try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like <i>poke</i> or stomach skin of
      the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
      hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were
      dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the
      Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured
      aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with
      glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious
      jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s company were tumultuously busy at the
      masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You
      would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such
      wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being
      hurled into the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship’s
      elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before
      him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.
    </p>
<p>
      And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with
      a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s wakes—one
      all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things
      to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole
      striking contrast of the scene.
    </p>
<p>
      “Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting a
      glass and a bottle in the air.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.
    </p>
<p>
      “No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the other
      good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come
      aboard, old hearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow.
      Come along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”
     </p>
<p>
      “How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art a
      full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty
      ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there!
      Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”
     </p>
<p>
      And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
      stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of
      the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding
      Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for the lively
      revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the
      homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and
      then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote
      associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.
    </h2>
<p>
      Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites
      sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
      rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it
      with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales
      were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson
      fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and
      whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such
      plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that
      it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the
      Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone
      to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
    </p>
<p>
      Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off
      from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now
      tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
      dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that
      strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab
      conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
    </p>
<p>
      “He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
      homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
      worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh
      that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights. Look!
      here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in these most
      candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets;
      where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still rolled on speechless
      and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the Niger’s unknown source;
      here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than
      death whirls round the corpse, and it heads some other way.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
      thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas; thou
      art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
      wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
      has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
      again, without a lesson to me.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed
      jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh
      whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only
      calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock
      me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings float
      beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled as
      air, but water now.
    </p>
<p>
      “Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl
      finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though hill
      and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.
    </h2>
<p>
      The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
      windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last
      three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not
      be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side
      all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.
    </p>
<p>
      The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and the
      lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the
      black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently
      chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
    </p>
<p>
      Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching
      in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the
      whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like
      the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
      Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
    </p>
<p>
      Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped
      round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded
      world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.
    </p>
<p>
      “Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin
      can be thine?”
     </p>
<p>
      “And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”
     </p>
<p>
      “But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
      hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
      mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
      America.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes
      floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
      sight we shall not soon see.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And what was that saying about thyself?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere
      I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was
      it not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here
      two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
      like fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,”
       cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”
     </p>
<p>
      Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
      slumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale
      was brought to the ship.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.
    </h2>
<p>
      The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
      coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
      ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
      the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on
      the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s prow for
      the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and
      Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his
      wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
      effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus
      of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered;
      clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of
      unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God’s throne. Well
      that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through which to
      take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of
      the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye,
      he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant
      when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole
      attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s
      deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with
      him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face
      was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired
      observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon
      calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling
      into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to
      himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly
      where I <i>am</i>—but canst thou cast the least hint where I <i>shall</i> be? Or
      canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living?
      Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of
      mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into
      the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,
      thither side of thee, thou sun!”
     </p>
<p>
      Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
      numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
      “Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and
      Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what
      after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou
      thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee:
      no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one
      grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence thou
      insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all
      the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness
      but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light,
      O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon are the glances of man’s
      eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze
      on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no
      longer will I guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and
      the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line; <i>these</i> shall conduct me, and
      show me my place on the sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck,
      “thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high;
      thus I split and destroy thee!”
     </p>
<p>
      As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead
      feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic
      despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the mute,
      motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away; while,
      awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together
      on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out—“To
      the braces! Up helm!—square in!”
     </p>
<p>
      In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her
      heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long,
      ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient
      steed.
    </p>
<p>
      Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s
      tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.
    </p>
<p>
      “I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of
      its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down,
      to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what
      will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck—sea-coal,
      not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter, ‘Here some one
      thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must play
      them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in
      the game, and die in it!”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 119. The Candles.
    </h2>
<p>
      Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches
      in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent but basket
      the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept
      tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese
      seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will
      sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a
      dazed and sleepy town.
    </p>
<p>
      Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
      bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
      ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
      thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
      fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
      tempest had left for its after sport.
    </p>
<p>
      Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every
      flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster
      might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were
      directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats.
      But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the
      cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did not escape. A great rolling
      sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship’s high teetering side, stove
      in the boat’s bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through
      like a sieve.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck, “but
      the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You see, Mr.
      Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round
      the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all the start
      I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never mind; it’s all
      in fun: so the old song says;”—(<i>sings</i>.)
    </p>
<pre>
  Oh! jolly is the gale,
  And a joker is the whale,
  A’ flourishin’ his tail,—
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
<p>The scud all a flyin’,<br>
That’s his flip only foamin’;<br>
When he stirs in the spicin’,—<br>
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!</p>
<p>Thunder splits the ships,<br>
But he only smacks his lips,<br>
A tastin’ of this flip,—<br>
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!<br>
</pre></p>
<p>
      “Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his harp
      here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy
      peace.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
      and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck,
      there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. And
      when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
      mind how foolish?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
      hand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes from
      the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very
      course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that
      stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his
      stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
      must!
    </p>
<p>
      “I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket,”
       soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s question. “The gale
      that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that
      will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom;
      but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up there; but not with
      the lightning.”
     </p>
<p>
      At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the
      flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a
      volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
    </p>
<p>
      “Who’s there?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
      pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
      lances of fire.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the
      perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships
      carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this
      conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all
      contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there,
      it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with
      some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel’s way in the
      water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship’s lightning-rods are
      not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender links, so as
      to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down
      into the sea, as occasion may require.
    </p>
<p>
      “The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to
      vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux, to
      light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and aft.
      Quick!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the weaker
      side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that
      all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”
     </p>
<p>
      All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
      tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
      the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
      three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
    </p>
<p>
      “Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
      sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
      jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but
      slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
      immediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on
      us all!”
     </p>
<p>
      To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
      the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from
      the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but
      in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God’s burning
      finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin”
       has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
    </p>
<p>
      While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
      enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all
      their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
      constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic
      jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the
      black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego
      revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too had
      been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preternatural light,
      Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body.
    </p>
<p>
      The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the
      Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two
      passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was
      Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same
      in the song.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope
      they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have
      they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too
      dark to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
      of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
      chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will work
      up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as
      three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”
     </p>
<p>
      At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning to
      glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once more
      the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
      supernaturalness in their pallor.
    </p>
<p>
      “The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.
    </p>
<p>
      At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the
      Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away from
      him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they
      had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by
      the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed
      wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like
      the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others
      remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame
      but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there;
      I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against
      fire! So.”
     </p>
<p>
      Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his
      foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
      he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once
      did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this
      hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know
      that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt
      thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed.
      No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless power;
      but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional,
      unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the personified impersonal, a
      personality stands here. Though but a point at best; whencesoe’er I came;
      wheresoe’er I go; yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives
      in me, and feels her royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come
      in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy
      highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of
      full-freighted worlds, there’s that in here that still remains
      indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a
      true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.”
     </p>
<p>
      [<i>Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to
      thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his
      right hand pressed hard upon them.</i>]
    </p>
<p>
      “I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung
      from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then
      grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of
      these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning
      flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten
      brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet
      blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out
      of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!
      The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh,
      thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my
      fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done
      with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how
      came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy
      beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou
      knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing
      thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but
      time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my
      scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit
      immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated
      grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and
      lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded
      with thee; defyingly I worship thee!”
     </p>
<p>
      “The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”
     </p>
<p>
      Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed in
      its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s bow;
      but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath
      to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame
      of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent’s
      tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is against thee,
      old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me
      square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it
      homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”
     </p>
<p>
      Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though
      not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate’s thoughts
      seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling
      lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved
      it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor
      that but cast loose a rope’s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more
      shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay,
      and Ahab again spoke:—
    </p>
<p>
      “All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart,
      soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to
      what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!”
       And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.
    </p>
<p>
      As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
      some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so
      much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so
      at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did run from him in a
      terror of dismay.

<p>
<i>Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over the
      anchors there hanging.</i>
</p>
<p>
      “No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you
      will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long ago
      is it since you said the very contrary? Didn’t you once say that whatever
      ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance
      policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of
      lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn’t you say so?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since that
      time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we <i>are</i> loaded with powder
      barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
      afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
      red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re Aquarius,
      or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat collar. Don’t
      you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies
      have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But hark, again, and I’ll
      answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off from the crown of the
      anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What’s the mighty
      difference between holding a mast’s lightning-rod in the storm, and
      standing close by a mast that hasn’t got any lightning-rod at all in a
      storm? Don’t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder
      of the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about,
      then? Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man,
      and all of us,—were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than
      all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you
      King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every man in the world go about
      with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a
      militia officer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
      don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye, then?
      any man with half an eye can be sensible.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s a
      fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the turn
      there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as
      if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here,
      Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands behind him. And what big generous
      hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold
      they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere;
      if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer
      that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on
      deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just wring out my jacket skirts,
      will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a
      long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails
      tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with
      cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more
      monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and
      drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard;
      Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
      This is a nasty night, lad.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 123. The Musket.
    </h2>
<p>
      During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s
      jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its
      spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it—for
      they were slack—because some play to the tiller was indispensable.
    </p>
<p>
      In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to
      the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses,
      at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod’s; at almost
      every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity
      with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone
      can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.
    </p>
<p>
      Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
      strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and
      the other aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and
      main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to
      leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to
      the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
    </p>
<p>
      The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
      storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the
      water with some precision again; and the course—for the present,
      East-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
      given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
      steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship
      as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good
      sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze became
      fair!
    </p>
<p>
      Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “<i>Ho! the fair
      wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!</i>” the crew singing for joy, that so promising
      an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.
    </p>
<p>
      In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report
      immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change
      in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards
      to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he
      mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
    </p>
<p>
      Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
      moment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was
      burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man’s bolted
      door,—a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper
      panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming
      silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
      elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they
      stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest,
      upright man; but out of Starbuck’s heart, at that instant when he saw the
      muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its
      neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for
      itself.
    </p>
<p>
      “He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’s the very musket
      that he pointed at me;—that one with the studded stock; let me touch
      it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances,
      strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and
      powder in the pan;—that’s not good. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll
      cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly while I think.—I
      come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,—<i>that’s</i>
      fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s only fair for that accursed
      fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—the very one; <i>this</i> one—I
      hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.—Aye
      and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike
      his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in
      these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of
      the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that
      he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely
      suffered to drag a whole ship’s company down to doom with him?—Yes,
      it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship
      come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship
      will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant—put
      aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes,
      just there,—in there, he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive,
      and soon awake again. I can’t withstand thee, then, old man. Not
      reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this
      thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou
      breathest. Aye, and say’st the men have vow’d thy vow; say’st all of us
      are Ahabs. Great God forbid!—But is there no other way? no lawful
      way?—Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this
      old man’s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try
      it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;
      chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous
      than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly
      fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would
      leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is
      hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here
      upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me and
      law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is heaven a murderer when its
      lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and
      skin together?—And would I be a murderer, then, if”—and
      slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded
      musket’s end against the door.
    </p>
<p>
      “On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head this way. A touch,
      and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh Mary!
      Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
      who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck’s body this day week may
      sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall I?—The
      wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails are reefed
      and set; she heads her course.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”
     </p>
<p>
      Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’s
      tormented sleep, as if Starbuck’s voice had caused the long dumb dream to
      speak.
    </p>
<p>
      The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the panel;
      Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
      placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
    </p>
<p>
      “He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
      him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 124. The Needle.
    </h2>
<p>
      Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
      mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on
      like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so,
      that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed
      before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was
      only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays
      moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and
      queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold,
      that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
    </p>
<p>
      Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
      the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye
      the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by
      the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward place, and how the
      same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
      the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!
      Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”
     </p>
<p>
      But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
      helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
    </p>
<p>
      “East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.
    </p>
<p>
      “Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this
      hour in the morning, and the sun astern?”
     </p>
<p>
      Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed
      by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding
      palpableness must have been the cause.
    </p>
<p>
      Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of
      the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed
      to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses
      pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
    </p>
<p>
      But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old
      man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened before. Mr.
      Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s all. Thou
      hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,
      gloomily.
    </p>
<p>
      Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
      one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
      developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with
      the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at,
      that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has actually
      struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the
      effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its
      loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was
      of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle. But in either case, the
      needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or
      lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all
      the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted
      into the kelson.
    </p>
<p>
      Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
      compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the
      precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly
      inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be changed
      accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her
      undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only
      been juggling her.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,
      but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask—who
      in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings—likewise
      unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly
      rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as
      ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or
      if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
      congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.
    </p>
<p>
      For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing
      to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the
      quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
    </p>
<p>
      “Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee,
      and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is
      lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without a
      pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles. Quick!”
     </p>
<p>
      Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to
      do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
      revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
      matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man
      well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
      practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,
      without some shudderings and evil portents.
    </p>
<p>
      “Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the
      things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s needles;
      but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point
      as true as any.”
     </p>
<p>
      Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this
      was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
      follow. But Starbuck looked away.
    </p>
<p>
      With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
      lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him
      hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after
      repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted
      needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several
      times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then going through some
      small strange motions with it—whether indispensable to the
      magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the
      crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread; and moving to the
      binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally
      suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At
      first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either
      end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently
      watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and
      pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,—“Look ye, for
      yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East,
      and that compass swears it!”
     </p>
<p>
      One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
      persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.
    </p>
<p>
      In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal
      pride.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.
    </h2>
<p>
      While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
      and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
      upon other means of determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen, and
      many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log;
      though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake than anything
      else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered
      by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of progression every
      hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log
      attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after
      bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all
      the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly. But heedless
      of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,
      not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his quadrant
      was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line.
      The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.
    </p>
<p>
      “Forward, there! Heave the log!”
     </p>
<p>
      Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. “Take
      the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”
     </p>
<p>
      They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the
      deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the
      creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
    </p>
<p>
      The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
      handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
      stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.
    </p>
<p>
      Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
      turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
      Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
      speak.
    </p>
<p>
      “Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
      spoiled it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
      Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs
      of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a superior, who’ll
      ne’er confess.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s
      granite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert
      thou born?”
     </p>
<p>
      “In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I know not, sir, but I was born there.”
     </p>
<p>
      “In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man
      from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
      which is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
      butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”
     </p>
<p>
      The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
      dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
      turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
      resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hold hard!”
     </p>
<p>
      Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging
      log was gone.
    </p>
<p>
      “I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea
      parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel
      up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend
      thou the line. See to it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer seems
      loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!
      These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging
      slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing.
      Let’s see now if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard;
      I guess he’s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no
      cowards here. Ho! there’s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a
      hatchet! cut it off—we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,
      sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board again.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. “Away
      from the quarter-deck!”
     </p>
<p>
      “The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing.
      “Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
    </p>
<p>
      “Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!”
     </p>
<p>
      “And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
      thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve
      through! Who art thou, boy?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hundred
      pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks cowardly—quickest
      known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip the coward?”
     </p>
<p>
      “There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look
      down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye
      creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s home
      henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou
      art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let’s down.”
     </p>
<p>
      “What’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s hand,
      and feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this,
      perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope;
      something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and
      rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I will
      not let this go.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
      horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in gods
      all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
      oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what
      he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel
      prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
      Emperor’s!”
     </p>
<p>
      “There go two daft ones now,” muttered the old Manxman. “One daft with
      strength, the other daft with weakness. But here’s the end of the rotten
      line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new
      line altogether. I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.
    </h2>
<p>
      Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress
      solely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her
      path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
      unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled
      by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed
      the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.
    </p>
<p>
      At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
      Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the
      dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then
      headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
      unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all
      Herod’s murdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their
      reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
      transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry
      remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said
      it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained
      unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of all—declared
      that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly
      drowned men in the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
      came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied
      with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the
      wonder.
    </p>
<p>
      Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
      of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that
      had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with
      her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the
      more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very
      superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar
      tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their round heads
      and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water
      alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than
      once been mistaken for men.
    </p>
<p>
      But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
      confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise
      this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether
      it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors
      sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus with the
      man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had not been long
      at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a rushing—and
      looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking down, a
      little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern,
      where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to
      seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so
      that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every
      pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom,
      as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for
      the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man was
      swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.
      Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a
      portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the
      future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared
      that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the
      night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.
    </p>
<p>
      The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to
      it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the
      feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage,
      all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with
      its final end, whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going
      to leave the ship’s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange
      signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.
    </p>
<p>
      “A life-buoy of a coffin!” cried Starbuck, starting.
    </p>
<p>
      “Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.
    </p>
<p>
      “It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here can
      arrange it easily.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a
      melancholy pause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the
      coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a
      caulking-iron.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand as
      with a pitch-pot.
    </p>
<p>
      “Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no
      more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.
      Now I don’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like
      a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won’t put his head
      into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I’m
      ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like turning an old coat; going to
      bring the flesh on the other side now. I don’t like this cobbling sort of
      business—I don’t like it at all; it’s undignified; it’s not my
      place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to
      take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs,
      something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle
      when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job,
      that’s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It’s the
      old woman’s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all
      old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away
      with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would
      work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the
      Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off
      with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see.
      Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten
      them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship’s stern.
      Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old
      carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the
      job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don’t budge. Cruppered
      with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We
      workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins
      and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not
      for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too
      confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I’ll do the job,
      now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s see—how many in the ship’s
      company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any way, I’ll have me thirty
      separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round
      to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there’ll be thirty lively
      fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath
      the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let’s
      to it.”

      they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
      monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
      next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
      same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
      jack-of-all-trades.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin?
      The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for
      volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost
      thou never?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the
      reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was
      none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to
      it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and what in all
      things makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught beneath. And
      yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
      Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the
      churchyard gate, going in?
    </p>
<p>
      “Faith, sir, I’ve——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Faith? What’s that?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all,
      sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Um, um; go on.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I was about to say, sir, that——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself? Look
      at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
      latitudes. I’ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos,
      is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of
      Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He’s always under the
      Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s looking this way—come, oakum;
      quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I’m the
      professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”
     </p>
<p>
      (<i>Ahab to himself</i>.)
    </p>
<p>
      “There’s a sight! There’s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker
      tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
      thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that
      fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
      materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
      now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
      expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy
      of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense
      the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I’ll think of
      that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other
      side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will
      ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let
      me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk
      this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown
      conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.
    </h2>
<p>
      Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
      upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time
      the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
      broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
      fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the
      smitten hull.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
      commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could
      hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”
     </p>
<p>
      Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and
      would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain
      himself, having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending her side. A
      few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod’s main-chains,
      and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a
      Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.
    </p>
<p>
      “Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely
      advancing. “How was it?”
     </p>
<p>
      It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while
      three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which
      had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were
      yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had
      suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon,
      the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been instantly
      lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat—the
      swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in fastening—at
      least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it.
      In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam
      of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was
      concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his
      pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive
      alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness
      came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats—ere
      going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction—the
      ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till
      near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it. But
      the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail
      on stunsail—after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots
      for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when
      she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of
      the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare
      boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed
      on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued
      doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had
      been seen.
    </p>
<p>
      The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
      object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own
      in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on
      parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.
    </p>
<p>
      “I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one in
      that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his watch—he’s
      so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships
      cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season?
      See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in the very buttons of
      his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been the—”
     </p>
<p>
      “My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I conjure”—here
      exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but icily
      received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship—I
      will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if there be no other
      way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you must,
      oh, you must, and you <i>shall</i> do this thing.”
     </p>
<p>
      “His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the coat
      and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”
     </p>
<p>
      “He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx sailor
      standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”
     </p>
<p>
      Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s the
      more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
      Captain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among the
      number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the other hand,
      separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there
      had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched father was
      plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which was only solved
      for him by his chief mate’s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure
      of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between
      jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first. But
      the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from
      mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he
      allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old,
      whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s
      paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and
      wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor
      does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of
      such tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’
      voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of
      a whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
      father’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
      concern.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and
      Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the
      least quivering of his own.
    </p>
<p>
      “I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say <i>aye</i> to me. Do to me as
      you would have me do to you in the like case. For <i>you</i> too have a boy,
      Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a
      child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run,
      run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
      prolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
      Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
      forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch,
      and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:
      then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”
     </p>
<p>
      Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving
      the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection
      of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner
      silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and
      returned to his ship.
    </p>
<p>
      Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
      was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
      however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;
      starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head
      sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and
      yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when
      the boys are cherrying among the boughs.
    </p>
<p>
      But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
      that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.
      She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.

      CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.
    </h2>
<p>
      (<i>Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.</i>)
    </p>
<p>
      “Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming
      when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him.
      There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady.
      Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired
      health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee, as if thou
      wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair;
      another screw to it, thou must be.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for your
      one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a part
      of ye.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
      fidelity of man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks
      like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”
     </p>
<p>
      “They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
      drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
      But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
      ye.”
     </p>
<p>
      “If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up in him. I
      tell thee no; it cannot be.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh good master, master, master!
    </p>
<p>
      “Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
      Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
      know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—Met! True art
      thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
      thee; and if it come to that,—God for ever save thee, let what will
      befall.”
     </p>
<p>
      (<i>Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.</i>)
    </p>
<p>
      “Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now
      were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!
      Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He must be up here; let’s try the door.
      What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no opening it. It
      must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this screwed
      chair was mine. Here, then, I’ll seat me, against the transom, in the
      ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me. Here, our
      old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit
      at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s
      this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the
      decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now,
      when a black boy’s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats!—Monsieurs,
      have ye seen one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog
      look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;—seen him? No!
      Well then, fill up again, captains, and let’s drink shame upon all
      cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table.
      Shame upon all cowards.—Hist! above there, I hear ivory—Oh,
      master! master! I am indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here
      I’ll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and
      oysters come to join me.”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 130. The Hat.
    </h2>
<p>
      And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
      preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed
      to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
      there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
      where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been
      spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;—and
      now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly
      concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale
      tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there
      lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable
      for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which through the
      livelong, arctic, six months’ night sustains its piercing, steady, central
      gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant
      midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their
      bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls,
      and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.
    </p>
<p>
      In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
      vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove
      to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to
      finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab’s
      iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious
      that the old man’s despot eye was on them.
    </p>
<p>
      But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he
      thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even
      as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance awed
      his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an
      added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such
      ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half
      uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or
      else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being’s body.
      And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had
      Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go below. He would stand
      still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did
      plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
      deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or
      exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the
      main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
      cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to
      step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless
      he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
      in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
      tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
      times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though
      he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the
      unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat
      and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day’s sunshine dried
      upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more
      beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent
      for.
    </p>
<p>
      He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast
      and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
      grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow
      idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though
      his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee’s
      mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never
      seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals
      some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent
      spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
      crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one
      word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest
      verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail,
      they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by
      the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
      Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned
      substance.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
      and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab
      seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
      seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade
      siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was
      solid Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
      from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till
      after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the
      striking of the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp!
      sharp!”
     </p>
<p>
      But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
      children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
      old man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly all
      except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and
      Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these
      suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally
      expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.
    </p>
<p>
      “I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye!
      Ahab must have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
      basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block,
      to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
      downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for
      the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end
      yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his
      crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo,
      Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm
      relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the rope, sir—I
      give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his person in the
      basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck
      being the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it.
      And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad
      upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead, astern, this side, and
      that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a
      height.
    </p>
<p>
      When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the
      rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted
      up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
      circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
      to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a
      wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft
      cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck;
      and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast
      down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,
      unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some
      carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.
      So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange
      thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who
      had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree
      approaching to decision—one of those too, whose faithfulness on the
      look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;—it was strange, that this
      was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his
      whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person’s hands.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
      minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
      incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
      latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
      in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet
      straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying
      again round his head.
    </p>
<p>
      But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not
      to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it
      much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful
      eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.
    </p>
<p>
      “Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being
      posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat
      lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.
    </p>
<p>
      But already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long hooked
      bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his
      prize.
    </p>
<p>
      An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to replace it,
      and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of
      Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good.
      Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far
      in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of
      that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from
      that vast height into the sea.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.
    </h2>
<p>
      The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
      life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
      misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed
      upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross
      the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the
      spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
    </p>
<p>
      Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some
      few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw
      through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
      half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his
      trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
    </p>
<p>
      “Hast killed him?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the
      other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered
      sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
      held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I
      hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
      barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin,
      where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the
      hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
      yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only <i>that</i> one I bury; the rest were
      buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning to his
      crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and lift
      the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with
      uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
    </p>
<p>
      But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
      of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so
      quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
      her hull with their ghostly baptism.
    </p>
<p>
      As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
      hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake. “In
      vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
      taffrail to show us your coffin!”

<h2>
      CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.
    </h2>
<p>
      It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly
      separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
      transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and
      man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s chest
      in his sleep.
    </p>
<p>
      Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
      unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but
      to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty
      leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled,
      murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
    </p>
<p>
      But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
      shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
      that distinguished them.
    </p>
<p>
      Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air
      to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling
      line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen here at
      the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms,
      with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
    </p>
<p>
      Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and
      unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of
      ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting
      his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s forehead of heaven.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
      creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
      oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
      little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
      their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the
      marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
    </p>
<p>
      Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and
      watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more
      and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely
      aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the
      cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did
      at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel—forbidding—now
      threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously
      sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could
      yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched
      hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such
      wealth as that one wee drop.
    </p>
<p>
      Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
      and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
      stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him,
      or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.
    </p>
<p>
      Ahab turned.
    </p>
<p>
      “Starbuck!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a
      day—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a
      boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago!
      Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
      storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
      forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of
      the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent
      three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of
      solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain’s
      exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
      green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery
      of solitary command!—when I think of all this; only half-suspected,
      not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty years I have fed
      upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!—when
      the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the
      world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away, whole oceans away,
      from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn
      the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow—wife? wife?—rather
      a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I
      married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling
      blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab
      has furiously, foamingly chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye,
      aye! what a forty years’ fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab
      been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the
      oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?
      Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear,
      one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old
      hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never
      grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old,
      Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam,
      staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack
      my heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting
      mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and
      feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look
      into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than
      to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
      the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
      stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab
      gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with
      the far away home I see in that eye!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why
      should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly
      these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck’s—wife
      and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine,
      sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age!
      Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter the course! How
      cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see
      old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days,
      even as this, in Nantucket.”
     </p>
<p>
      “They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the
      morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy
      vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
      cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to
      dance him again.”
     </p>
<p>
      “’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,
      should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father’s
      sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my
      Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy’s face
      from the window! the boy’s hand on the hill!”
     </p>
<p>
      But Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
      cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
    </p>
<p>
      “What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
      cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands
      me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and
      crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready
      to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare?
      Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great
      sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single
      star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small
      heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that
      beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man,
      we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and
      Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this
      unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase and
      fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the
      judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a
      mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away
      meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes,
      Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping?
      Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye,
      and rust amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in
      the half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”
     </p>
<p>
      But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
    </p>
<p>
      Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two
      reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
      leaning over the same rail.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.
    </h2>
<p>
      That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at
      intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and
      went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
      up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
      barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar
      odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale,
      was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after
      inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the
      precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered
      the ship’s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.
    </p>
<p>
      The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at
      daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise
      ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles
      bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at
      the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
    </p>
<p>
      “Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”
     </p>
<p>
      Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
      deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed
      to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their
      clothes in their hands.
    </p>
<p>
      “What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
    </p>
<p>
      “Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.
    </p>
<p>
      “T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”
     </p>
<p>
      All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying
      him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting
      him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while
      peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and
      top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air. “There she blows!—there
      she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!”
     </p>
<p>
      Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
      look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
      whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch,
      some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on
      the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s head was almost on a
      level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile
      or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump,
      and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous
      mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in
      the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
    </p>
<p>
      “And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
      all around him.
    </p>
<p>
      “I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
      cried out,” said Tashtego.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
      reserved the doubloon for me. <i>I</i> only; none of ye could have raised the
      White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she
      blows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn,
      lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the
      whale’s visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
      top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on
      board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man,
      steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats
      there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,—quick,
      quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.
    </p>
<p>
      “He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from
      us; cannot have seen the ship yet.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!
      Shiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”
     </p>
<p>
      Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails set—all
      the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab
      heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a
      hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
    </p>
<p>
      Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
      but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
      still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
      noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came
      so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was
      distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and
      continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He
      saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond.
      Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening
      white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully
      accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed
      over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright
      bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the
      light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate
      with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the
      painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance
      projected from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud
      of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over
      the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers
      streaming like pennons.
    </p>
<p>
      A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,
      invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
      ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes
      sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling
      straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty
      Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.
    </p>
<p>
      On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once
      leaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale
      shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
      namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to
      assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
      tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who
      for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way thou
      may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
      waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick
      moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged
      trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the
      fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole
      marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s Natural Bridge, and
      warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed
      himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping
      on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool
      that he left.
    </p>
<p>
      With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the
      three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.
    </p>
<p>
      “An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed
      beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
      vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
      whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now
      freshened; the sea began to swell.
    </p>
<p>
      “The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.
    </p>
<p>
      In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now
      all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began
      fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
      expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could discover
      no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its
      depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
      weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till
      it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of
      white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It
      was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still
      half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned
      beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong
      sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this
      tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with
      him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his
      crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its
      bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet under
      water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious
      intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were,
      in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.
    </p>
<p>
      Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an
      instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting
      shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that
      the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and
      one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the
      inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s head, and reached higher
      than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as
      a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and
      crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each
      other’s heads to gain the uttermost stern.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
      whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
      body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the
      bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the
      other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to
      withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing
      vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless in the very
      jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his
      naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus
      vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in,
      collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding
      further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast
      again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated
      aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to
      the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.
    </p>
<p>
      At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to
      perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
      movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
      made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping
      further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped,
      the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he
      leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
      distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
      billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so
      that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet
      out of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent
      waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered
      spray still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled
      Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly
      to overleap its summit with their scud.
    </p>
<p>
      *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation
      (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise
      of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously
      described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
      view whatever objects may be encircling him.
    </p>
<p>
      But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
      and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
      wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.
      The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of
      grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the book of
      Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale’s
      insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he could
      still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless
      Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
      might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and
      mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
      succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so
      revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s aspect, and so planetarily
      swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally
      swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered
      hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that
      should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized
      castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to
      escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the
      direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man’s head.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s
      mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and
      was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on the”—but
      that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him
      for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a
      towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him
      off!”
     </p>
<p>
      The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she
      effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam
      off, the boats flew to the rescue.
    </p>
<p>
      Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine
      caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily strength did
      crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a time, lying all
      crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden under foot of
      herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate
      sounds from out ravines.
    </p>
<p>
      But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
      abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to
      one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
      through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in
      each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
      aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities;
      for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain the
      entire circumferences of inferior souls.
    </p>
<p>
      “The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one
      bended arm—“is it safe?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.
    </p>
<p>
      “Lay it before me;—any missing men?”
     </p>
<p>
      “One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here
      are five men.”
     </p>
<p>
      “That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!
      there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands
      off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail;
      out oars; the helm!”
     </p>
<p>
      It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up
      by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus
      continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the
      added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he
      seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which
      plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the
      chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor
      could any crew endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense
      straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief
      vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the
      most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly,
      the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the
      two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her—and
      then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and
      sideways outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings
      of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
      the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was
      regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be
      reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the
      deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted
      hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now? D’ye
      see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to
      lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and
      motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
    </p>
<p>
      As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,
      or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still
      greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at
      every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the
      quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At
      last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh
      troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man’s face
      there now stole some such added gloom as this.
    </p>
<p>
      Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince
      his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his
      Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The
      thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”
     </p>
<p>
      “What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did I
      not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear
      thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen, and
      an ill one.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
      man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give
      an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
      of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye
      two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the
      peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How
      now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout
      ten times a second!”
     </p>
<p>
      The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
      Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.
    </p>
<p>
      “Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from
      the air.
    </p>
<p>
      “How heading when last seen?”
     </p>
<p>
      “As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and top-gallant
      stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he’s
      making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full
      before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send a fresh
      hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning.”—Then
      advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men, this gold is
      mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale
      is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall
      be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on that day I shall again raise
      him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!—the
      deck is thine, sir!”
     </p>
<p>
      And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
      slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing
      himself to see how the night wore on.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.
    </h2>
<p>
      At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
    </p>
<p>
      “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to
      spread.
    </p>
<p>
      “See nothing, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;—the
      top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all night.
      But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”
     </p>
<p>
      Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
      continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
      by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the
      wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence
      acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;
      that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,
      under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the
      direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
      sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.
      And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a
      coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly
      to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands
      by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present
      visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen
      headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass,
      with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through
      several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the
      creature’s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to
      the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that
      to this hunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing
      writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as
      the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway
      is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
      hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly
      say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,
      at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these
      Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the
      observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence
      this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this
      or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at
      all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman’s
      allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is
      the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a
      quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many
      collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.
    </p>
<p>
      The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball,
      missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.
    </p>
<p>
      “By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck creeps
      up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave
      fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on
      the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
      that leaves no dust behind!”
     </p>
<p>
      “There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was
      now the mast-head cry.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on
      and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
      your trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood,
      as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!”
     </p>
<p>
      And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of
      the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked
      anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt
      before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe
      of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid
      prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had
      snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day;
      the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind,
      reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying
      mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that
      made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms
      invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency
      which so enslaved them to the race.
    </p>
<p>
      They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
      though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,
      and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each
      other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
      directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the
      crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all
      varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal
      goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
    </p>
<p>
      The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
      outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
      hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading
      their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all
      the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah!
      how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing
      that might destroy them!
    </p>
<p>
      “Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after the
      lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. “Sway
      me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that
      way, and then disappears.”
     </p>
<p>
      It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
      other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
      hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin
      on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air
      vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo
      of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship than
      the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick
      bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by
      the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White
      Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of
      breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the
      Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and
      piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of
      seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes
      off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.
    </p>
<p>
      “There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his
      immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
      Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
      against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
      the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and stood
      there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity,
      to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour and
      thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
      fore. The boats!—stand by!”
     </p>
<p>
      Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
      shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards;
      while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.
    </p>
<p>
      “Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare
      one, rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep
      away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”
     </p>
<p>
      As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
      assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three
      crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he
      would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up to his
      forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
      such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong vision.
      But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were
      plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning
      himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among
      the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on
      every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,
      seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those
      boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly wheeling like
      trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though,
      at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the time, Ahab’s unearthly
      slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
    </p>
<p>
      But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and
      recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines
      now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the
      devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment
      the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous
      charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then
      was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping that way to
      disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage
      than the embattled teeth of sharks!
    </p>
<p>
      Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
      harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
      flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only
      one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
      within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel;
      dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then,
      twice sundering the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted
      fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the
      White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other
      lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb
      and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks
      on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in
      a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the
      wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred
      bowl of punch.
    </p>
<p>
      While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
      the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope
      little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs
      upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily
      singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man’s line—now
      parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom
      he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted
      perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by
      invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the
      sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and
      sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again—gunwale
      downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like
      seals from a sea-side cave.
    </p>
<p>
      The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as
      he struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a
      little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with
      his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes
      from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
      or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
      came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for
      that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and
      trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a
      traveller’s methodic pace.
    </p>
<p>
      As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came
      bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating
      mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely
      landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles;
      livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies
      of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or
      even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day
      before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat’s broken half,
      which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as
      the previous day’s mishap.
    </p>
<p>
      But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
      instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
      Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg
      had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
      will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I
      put good work into that leg.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But
      even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living
      bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white
      whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper
      and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
      yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Dead to leeward, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the
      spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s
      crews.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
      unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sir?”
     </p>
<p>
      “My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that
      shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By
      heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”
     </p>
<p>
      The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
      Parsee was not there.
    </p>
<p>
      “The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”
     </p>
<p>
      “The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
      forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”
     </p>
<p>
      But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
      nowhere to be found.
    </p>
<p>
      “Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I
      thought I saw him dragging under.”
     </p>
<p>
      “<i>My</i> line! <i>my</i> line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What
      death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
      The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the
      forged iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered
      fool! this hand did dart it!—’tis in the fish!—Aloft there!
      Keep him nailed—Quick!—all hands to the rigging of the boats—collect
      the oars—harpooneers! the irons, the irons!—hoist the royals
      higher—a pull on all the sheets!—helm there! steady, steady
      for your life! I’ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive
      straight through it, but I’ll slay him yet!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;
      “never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more
      of this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
      to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
      shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more
      wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps
      the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be
      towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety and blasphemy to hunt
      him more!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour
      we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this
      matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
      hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
      whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
      years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act
      under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand
      round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a
      shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s
      part; but Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I
      feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
      gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till ye
      hear <i>that</i>, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men,
      in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they
      drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to
      sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s floated—tomorrow
      will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but only to spout
      his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”
     </p>
<p>
      “As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.
    </p>
<p>
      “And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
      muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to
      Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to
      drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The
      Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but
      still was to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s
      a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the
      whole line of judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. <i>I’ll</i>,
      <i>I’ll</i> solve it, though!”
     </p>
<p>
      When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
    </p>
<p>
      So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
      the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
      grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns
      in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
      their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab’s
      wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the
      night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid,
      heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due
      eastward for the earliest sun.

<h2>
      CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.
    </h2>
<p>
      The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
      solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
      daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
    </p>
<p>
      “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
    </p>
<p>
      “In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm
      there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
      again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
      angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer
      day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had Ahab time
      to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; <i>that’s</i>
      tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only has that
      right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a
      calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for
      that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen
      calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned
      to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment
      growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like that sort of common
      grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice
      or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as
      the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile
      wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells,
      and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither
      as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind,
      I’d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to
      a cave, and slink there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind!
      who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.
      Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that
      strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even
      Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than <i>that</i>. Would now the wind
      but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal
      man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as
      agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious
      difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there’s something
      all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least,
      that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast,
      vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser
      currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the
      land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the
      eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on;
      these Trades, or something like them—something so unchangeable, and
      full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d’ye
      see?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nothing, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye,
      aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye, he’s
      chasing <i>me</i> now; not I, <i>him</i>—that’s bad; I might have known it, too.
      Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him
      by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
      outs! Man the braces!”
     </p>
<p>
      Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s
      quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
      ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
      white wake.
    </p>
<p>
      “Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
      himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God keep
      us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my
      flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. “We
      should meet him soon.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and once
      more Ahab swung on high.
    </p>
<p>
      A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
      long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
      weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three
      mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.
    </p>
<p>
      “Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
      there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far
      off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman
      with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have
      one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s time for that. An
      old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink
      since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!—the
      same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’s a soft shower to leeward.
      Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere—to something else
      than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes
      that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But
      good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny
      mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab’s
      head! There’s the difference now between man’s old age and matter’s. But
      aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are
      we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood
      has the better of my live flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and
      I’ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of
      the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should
      still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I
      have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless
      stairs? and all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.
      Aye, aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O
      Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep
      a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow, nay,
      to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.”
     </p>
<p>
      He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through
      the cloven blue air to the deck.
    </p>
<p>
      In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s
      stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
      mate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him
      pause.
    </p>
<p>
      “Starbuck!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Sir?”
     </p>
<p>
      “For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
      Starbuck!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Truth, sir: saddest truth.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
      flood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb,
      Starbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”
     </p>
<p>
      Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see,
      it’s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by
      the crew!”
     </p>
<p>
      In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
    </p>
<p>
      “The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;
      “O master, my master, come back!”
     </p>
<p>
      But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
      boat leaped on.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
      numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the
      hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they
      dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their
      bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those
      swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same
      prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments
      in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the
      Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was
      that Ahab’s crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore
      their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a matter
      sometimes well known to affect them,—however it was, they seemed to
      follow that one boat without molesting the others.
    </p>
<p>
      “Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
      following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring
      boldly to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and
      followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third
      day?—For when three days flow together in one continuous intense
      pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the
      third the evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may.
      Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly
      calm, yet expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things
      swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is
      somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!
      I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life
      seem clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming?
      My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats
      it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak
      aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft
      there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the
      whale!—Ho! again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears
      the vane”—pointing to the red flag flying at the
      main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with it!—Where’s the old man
      now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder, shudder!”
     </p>
<p>
      The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a
      downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending
      to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways
      from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence,
      as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.
    </p>
<p>
      “Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads drive
      them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse
      can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”
     </p>
<p>
      Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
      quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
      swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
      subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
      trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but
      obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it
      hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back
      into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an
      instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes,
      leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk
      of the whale.
    </p>
<p>
      “Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the
      attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby
      Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven.
      The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead,
      beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came
      churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart;
      spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates’ boats, and dashing
      in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab’s almost
      without a scar.
    </p>
<p>
      While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
      whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
      shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and
      round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,
      during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
      around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment
      frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.
    </p>
<p>
      The harpoon dropped from his hand.
    </p>
<p>
      “Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye,
      Parsee! I see thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, <i>this</i>
      then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last
      letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship!
      those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to
      me; if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that
      but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
      not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the
      whale? gone down again?”
     </p>
<p>
      But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
      corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
      been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily
      swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus far had
      been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her
      headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and
      now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third day,
      to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly
      seekest him!”
     </p>
<p>
      Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
      leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the
      vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he leaned
      over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not
      too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego,
      Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the
      oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been
      hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing them. One after
      the other, through the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying
      glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of
      new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the
      broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But
      he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the
      main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to
      descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to
      the mast.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to his
      swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent
      deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale’s way
      now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him
      once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not been so long a one
      as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks
      accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so
      continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and
      crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.
    </p>
<p>
      “Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on!
      ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”
     </p>
<p>
      “They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he
      muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
      Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm!
      take the helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped
      him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.
    </p>
<p>
      At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with
      the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance—as
      the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the smoky
      mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled round his
      great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body
      arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted
      his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both
      steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick
      sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow,
      and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that
      had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then
      clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was,
      three of the oarsmen—who foreknew not the precise instant of the
      dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects—these were flung
      out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale
      again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily
      inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat
      and swimming.
    </p>
<p>
      Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
      instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea.
      But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line,
      and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and
      tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that
      double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
    </p>
<p>
      “What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!
      Burst in upon him!”
     </p>
<p>
      Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
      round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
      catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in
      it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
      larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow,
      smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
    </p>
<p>
      Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands! stretch
      out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”
     </p>
<p>
      “The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever
      too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the
      ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”
     </p>
<p>
      But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
      sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
      burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay
      nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard
      to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
    </p>
<p>
      Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer
      remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
      with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
      forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
      bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as
      he.
    </p>
<p>
      “The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,
      now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman’s
      fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the
      end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab,
      Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again! He
      turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose
      duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me now!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help
      Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
      Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own unwinking eye?
      And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would
      it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look
      ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever
      spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye,
      would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but
      there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off
      shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and
      over salted death, though;—cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask,
      for one red cherry ere we die!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my
      poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now
      come to her, for the voyage is up.”
     </p>
<p>
      From the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
      bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands,
      just as they had darted from their various employments; all their
      enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely
      vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading
      semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance,
      eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man
      could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship’s
      starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their
      faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on
      their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as
      mountain torrents down a flume.
    </p>
<p>
      “The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat;
      “its wood could only be American!”
     </p>
<p>
      Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel;
      but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the
      other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a time, he
      lay quiescent.
    </p>
<p>
      “I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer.
      Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only
      god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious
      ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last fond
      pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life!
      Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from
      all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole
      foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I
      roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple
      with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my
      last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
      and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
      chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! <i>Thus</i>, I give up the
      spear!”
     </p>
<p>
      The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
      velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to
      clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck,
      and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out
      of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy
      eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of the stark-empty tub,
      knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.
    </p>
<p>
      For an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The
      ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering
      mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana;
      only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or
      fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers
      still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric
      circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating
      oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round
      and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of
      sight.
    </p>
<p>
      But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken
      head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar
      yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly
      undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they
      almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered
      backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster
      and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had
      followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among the stars,
      pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced
      to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood;
      and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage
      beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird
      of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards,
      and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his
      ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a
      living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
    </p>
<p>
      Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white
      surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great
      shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.

      Epilogue
    </h2>
<h3>
      “AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE” Job.
    </h3>
<p>
      The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one
      did survive the wreck.
    </p>
<p>
      It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the
      Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman
      assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men
      were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating
      on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the
      halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly,
      drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a
      creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the
      button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like
      another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black
      bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,
      and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin
      life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.
      Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on
      a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with
      padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.
      On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It
      was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her
      missing children, only found another orphan.

<p>😫  你是否遇到这样的<strong>痛点</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>铺天盖地的信息让人窒息而焦虑</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OneNote</strong>笔记本塞满了从<strong>古早年代</strong>的校内网扒拉的各种技术资源神贴，缺乏双链，搜索困难</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notion</strong>花里胡哨，All in One的宏大愿景与系统崩溃的尴尬<strong>交相辉映</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>语雀</strong>简单易用但是仍然免不了沦为第二个OneNote</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supermemo</strong>渐进式阅读非常强大，但是学习成本高，历史包袱重，与其他知识管理工具不互通</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kindle、kobo、NeatReader、BookxNote、Apple Books各种<strong>电子书阅读应用</strong>让人眼花缭乱，但是假若需要摘抄笔记的一段文字链接至书本文章原文，却无法直接实现</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>💡  鉴于以上痛点，博主于今年7月萌生这样一个想法：</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>搭建一个个人博客站点，带有内容搜索功能</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>将日常阅读所遇到一些重要的书籍、资料，转化成<strong>Markdown</strong>格式的文本资料，贴入博客</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>辅以<strong>ReadWise</strong>、<strong>Hylinker</strong>等类似功能的工具插件，将网页浏览器阅读之内容高亮标记作为笔记，同步至<strong>Obsidian</strong>或<strong>Notion</strong>等笔记软件</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>笔记软件仅记录重要知识点或仅记录个人知识内化的<strong>加工笔记</strong>，需要查阅原文时点击链接即可<strong>跳转</strong>至个人博客站点对应之高亮处内容</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chrome</strong>无疑才是最佳的电子书阅读器，各种插件和<strong>油猴</strong>辅助，特别是还可以魔法加持绕过paywall阅读各种在线电子刊物</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>⚙️  基于如上设想，促成了本站的创建。以上设想功能，原则上都可实现，但尚有如下待确认实施</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>找到方便的工具能将电子书及资料转换成<strong>html</strong>格式文件或Markdown文本，便于贴入此站</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ReadWise虽妙，但订阅成本偏高，找寻替代工具，并可完美实现直接跳转至高亮文本所在位置</p>
</li>
</ul>
